Item 1A. Risk Factors" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 ("Annual Report"). For information on our sales and long-lived assets by geographic areas, see Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" ("Item 8") of this Annual Report.As previously disclosed in our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K, we reorganized our divisional operations by combining the former Flowserve Pump Division ("FPD") and former Flow Solutions Division ("FSD") into the Flow Solutions Group ("FSG"), effective January 1, 2010. FSG was divided into two reportable segments: FSG Engineered Product Division and FSG Industrial Product Division. Flow Control Division was not affected. We have retrospectively adjusted prior period financial information to reflect our current reporting structure.We conduct our operations through three business segments based on type of product and how we manage the business:•FSG Engineered Product Division ("EPD") for long lead-time, custom and other highly-engineered pumps and pump systems, mechanical seals, auxiliary systems and replacement parts and related services; 1Table of Contents•FSG Industrial Product Division ("IPD") for pre-configured engineered pumps and pump systems and related products and services; and •Flow Control Division ("FCD") for engineered and industrial valves, control valves, actuators and controls and related services. Our business segments share a focus on industrial flow control technology and have a high number of common customers. These segments also have complementary product offerings and technologies that are often combined in applications which provide us a net competitive advantage. Our segments also benefit from our global footprint and our economies of scale in reducing administrative and overhead costs to serve customers more cost effectively.StrategiesOur overarching objective is to grow our position as a product and integrated solutions provider in the flow control industry. This objective includes continuing to sell products by building on existing sales relationships and leveraging the power of our portfolio of products and services. It also includes delivering specific end user solutions that help customers attain their business goals by ensuring maximum reliability at a decreased cost of ownership. We seek to drive increasing enterprise value by using strategies that are well communicated throughout the company. These strategies include: disciplined profitable growth, customer intimacy, innovation and portfolio management, strategic localization, operational excellence, employee focus and sustainable business model. The key elements of these strategies are outlined below.Disciplined Profitable GrowthDisciplined profitable growth is an important strategy focused on growing revenues profitably from our existing portfolio of products and services, as well as through the development or acquisition of new customer-driven products and services. An overarching goal is to focus on opportunities that can maximize the organic growth from existing customers and to evaluate potential new customer-partnering initiatives that maximize the capture of the product’s total life cycle. We believe we are the largest major pump, valve and seal company that can offer customers a differentiated option of flow management products and services across a broad portfolio, as well as offer additional options that include any combination of products and solution support packages.We also seek to continue to review our substantial installed pump, valve and seal base as a means to expand the aftermarket parts and services business, as customers are increasingly using third-party aftermarket parts and service providers to reduce their fixed costs and improve profitability. To date, the aftermarket business has provided us with a steady source of revenues and cash flows at higher margins than original equipment sales.  Aftermarket sales in 2011 represented approximately 41% of total sales, as compared with approximately 39% of total sales for the same period in 2010. We are building on our established presence through an extensive global QRC network to provide the immediate parts, service and technical support required to effectively manage and win the aftermarket business created from our installed base.Customer IntimacyCustomer intimacy defines our approach to being prepared to serve the needs of our current and future customers better than our competition. Through our ongoing relationships with our customers, we seek to gain a rich understanding of their business objectives and how our portfolio of offerings can help them succeed. We collaborate with our customers on the front end engineering and design work to drive flow management solutions that effectively generate the desired business outcomes. As we progress through original equipment projects, we work closely with our customers to understand and prepare for the long-term support needs for the operations with the intent of maximizing total life cycle value for our customers’ investments.We seek to capture additional aftermarket business by creating mutually beneficial opportunities for us and our customers through sourcing and maintenance alliance programs where we provide all or an agreed-upon portion of customers’ parts and servicing needs. These customer alliances enable us to develop long-term professional relationships with our customers and serve as an effective platform for introducing new products and services to our customers and generating additional sales.Innovation and Portfolio ManagementThe ongoing management of our portfolio of products and services is critical to our success. As part of managing our portfolio, we continue to rationalize our portfolio of products and services to ensure alignment with changing market requirements. We also continue to invest in research and development ("R&D") to expand the scope of our product offerings and our deployment of advanced technologies. The infusion of advanced technologies into new products and services continues to play a critical role in the ongoing evolution of our product portfolio. Our objective is to improve the percentage of revenue derived from new products as a function of overall sales, utilizing technological innovation to improve overall product life cycle and total cost of ownership for our customers.2Table of ContentsWe employ a robust portfolio management and project execution process to seek out new product and technology opportunities, evaluate their potential return on investment and allocate resources to their development on a prioritized basis. Each project is reviewed on a routine basis for such performance measures as time to market, net present value, budget adherence, technical and commercial risk and compliance with customer requirements. Technical skill sets and knowledge are deployed across business unit boundaries to ensure that we bring the best capabilities to bear for each project. Collectively, the R&D portfolio is a key to our ability to differentiate our product and service offerings from other competitors in our target markets.We are focused on exploring and commercializing new technologies. In many of our research areas, we are teaming with universities and experts in the appropriate scientific fields to accelerate the required learning and to shorten the development time in leveraging the value of applied technologies in our products and services. Our intent is to be a market leader in the application of advanced technology to improve product performance and return on investment for our customers.Predictive diagnostics and asset management continue to be the biggest areas of effort for us across all our divisions. Building on the strength of our ValveSight and Technology Enabled Asset Management solutions introduced in late 2008, we have continued to deploy our diagnostics capabilities into more devices and expand on the number of host control systems and third party solutions with which we can achieve interoperability. These capabilities continue to provide a key source of competitive advantage in the market place and are saving our customers time and money in keeping their operations running.We continually evaluate acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic investment opportunities to broaden our product portfolio, service capabilities, geographic presence and operational capabilities to meet the growing needs of our customers. We evaluate all investment opportunities through a decision filtering process to ensure a good strategic, financial and cultural fit.In 2011, our acquisition activities focused on adjacent technology and product capabilities. Effective October 28, 2011, we acquired for inclusion in EPD, 100% of Lawrence Pumps, Inc. ("LPI"), a privately-owned, United States ("U.S.") based pump manufacturer, in a share purchase for cash of $89.6 million.  LPI specializes in the design, development and manufacture of engineered centrifugal slurry pumps for critical services within the petroleum refining, petrochemical, pulp and paper and energy markets. In addition, in a separate and unrelated transaction, we acquired wireless technology solutions to allow us to offer an efficient and economical means of monitoring equipment and processes in tough industrial environments such as oil and gas, chemical, power generation and related industries, which will further enhance our product capabilities.Strategic LocalizationStrategic localization describes our global growth strategy. We recognize that as a multi-national company it will take more than a few years to become truly global. Therefore, our strategy focuses on advancing our presence appropriately in geographies deemed to be critical to our future success as a company. This business strategy focuses on the following areas:•expanding our global presence to capture business in developing geographic market areas;•utilizing low-cost sourcing opportunities to remain competitive in the global economy; and•attracting and retaining the global intellectual capital required to support our growth plans in new geographical areas.We believe there are attractive opportunities in international markets, particularly in China, India, the Middle East, Russia, Africa and Latin America, and we intend to continue to utilize our global presence and strategically invest to further penetrate these markets. In the aftermarket services business, we seek to strategically add QRC sites in order to provide rapid response, fast delivery and field repair on a global scale for our customers. In 2011, we added six QRCs, expanding our ability to effectively deliver aftermarket support globally.We believe that future success will be supported by investments made to establish indigenous operations to effectively serve the local market while taking advantage of low-cost manufacturing, competent engineering and strategic sourcing where practical. We believe that this positions us well to support our global customers from project conception through commissioning and throughout the life of their operations.We continue to develop and increase our manufacturing, engineering and sourcing functions in lower-cost regions and emerging markets such as India, China, Mexico, Latin America, the Middle East and Eastern Europe as we drive higher value-add from our supply base of materials and components and satisfy local content requirements. In 2011, these lower-cost regions supplied our divisions with direct materials ranging from 17% to 40% of divisional spending.Operational ExcellenceThe operational excellence strategy encapsulates ongoing programs that work to drive increased customer fulfillment and yield internal productivity. This initiative includes:•driving improved customer fulfillment through metrics such as on-time delivery, cost reduction, quality, cycle time reduction and warranty cost reduction as a percentage of sales;3Table of Contents•continuing to develop a culture of continuous improvement that delivers maximum productivity and cost efficiencies; and•implementing global functional competencies to drive standardized processes.We seek to increase our operational efficiency through our Continuous Improvement Process ("CIP") initiative, which utilizes tools such as value analysis, value engineering, six sigma methodology, lean manufacturing and capacity management to improve quality and processes, reduce product cycle times and lower costs. Recognizing that employees are our most valuable resource in achieving operational excellence goals, we have instituted CIP training tailored to maximize the impact on our business. To date, approximately 1,600 active employees are CIP-trained or certified as "Green Belts," "Black Belts" or "Master Black Belts," and are deployed on CIP projects throughout our company in operations, as well as in the front office of the business. As a result of the CIP initiative, we have developed and implemented processes to reduce our engineering and manufacturing process cycle time, improve on-time delivery and service response time, optimize inventory levels and reduce costs. We have also experienced success in sharing and applying best practices achieved in one business segment and deploying those ideas to other segments of the business.We continue to rationalize existing Enterprise Resource Planning ("ERP") systems onto six strategic ERP systems. Going forward, these six strategic ERP systems will be maintained as core systems with standard tool sets, and will be enhanced as needed to meet the growing needs of the business in areas such as e-commerce, back office optimization and export compliance. Further investment in non-strategic ERP systems will be limited to compliance matters and conversion to strategic ERP systems.We also seek to improve our working capital utilization, with a particular focus on management of accounts receivable and inventory. See further discussion in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Annual Report.Employee FocusWe focus on several elements in our strategic efforts to continuously enhance our organizational capability, including:•institutionalizing our succession planning along with our leadership competencies and performance management capabilities, with a focus on key positions and critical talent pools;•utilizing these capabilities to drive employee engagement through our training initiatives and leadership development programs and facilitate our cross-divisional and functional development assignments;•developing talent acquisition programs such as our engineering recruitment program to address critical talent needs to support our emerging markets and global growth;•capturing the intellectual capital in the current workforce, disseminating it throughout our company and sharing it with customers as a competitive advantage;•creating a total compensation program that provides our associates with equitable opportunities that are competitive and linked to business and individual performance while promoting employee behavior consistent with our code of business conduct and risk tolerance; and•building a diverse and globally inclusive organization with a strong ethical and compliance culture based on transparency and trust.We continue to focus on training through the distribution of electronic learning packages in multiple languages for our Code of Business Conduct, workplace harassment, facility safety, anti-bribery, export compliance and other regulatory and compliance programs. We continue to drive our training and leadership development programs through the deployment of general management development, manager competencies and a series of multi-lingual "course-in-a-box" programs that focus on enhancing people management skills.Sustainable Business ModelThe sustainable business model initiative is focused on all of the areas that have the potential of adversely affecting our reputation, limiting our financial flexibility or creating unnecessary risk for any of our stakeholders. We proactively administer an enterprise risk management program with regular reviews of high-level matters with our Board of Directors. We work with our capital sourcing partners to ensure that our credit facilities and terms are appropriately aligned with our business strategy. We also train our associates on and monitor matters of a legal or ethical nature to support understanding and compliance on a global basis.4Table of ContentsCompetitionDespite consolidation activities in past years, the markets for our products remain highly competitive, with primary competitive drivers being price, reputation, timeliness of delivery, quality, proximity to service centers and technical expertise, as well as contractual terms and previous installation history. In the pursuit of large capital projects, competitive drivers and competition vary depending on the industry and products involved. Industries experiencing slow growth generally tend to have a competitive environment more heavily influenced by price due to supply outweighing demand, and price competition tends to be more significant for original equipment orders than aftermarket services. Considering the domestic and global economic environments in 2011 and current forecasts for 2012, pricing was and may continue to be a particularly influential competitive factor. The unique competitive environments in each of our three business segments are discussed in more detail under the “Business Segments” heading below.In the aftermarket portion of our business, we compete against large and well-established national and global competitors and, in some markets, against regional and local companies who produce low-cost replications of spare parts. In the oil and gas industry, the primary competitors for aftermarket services tend to be customers’ own in-house capabilities. In the nuclear power generation industry, we possess certain competitive advantages due to our "N Stamp" certification, which is a prerequisite to serve customers in that industry, and our considerable base of proprietary knowledge. In other industries, the competitors for aftermarket services tend to be local independent repair shops and low-cost replicators. Aftermarket competition for standardized products is aggressive due to the existence of common standards allowing for easier replacement or repair of the installed products.In the sale of aftermarket products and services, we benefit from our large installed base of pumps, valves and seals, which continually require maintenance, repair and replacement parts due to the nature of the products and the conditions under which they operate. Timeliness of delivery, quality and the proximity of service centers are important customer considerations when selecting a provider for aftermarket products and services. In geographic regions where we are locally positioned to provide a quick response, customers have traditionally relied on us, rather than our competitors, for aftermarket products relating to our highly engineered and customized products, although we are seeing increased competition in this area.Generally, our customers attempt to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase, thereby reducing the size and diversity of their inventory. Although vendor reduction programs could adversely affect our business, we have been successful in establishing long-term supply agreements with a number of customers. While the majority of these agreements do not provide us with exclusive rights, they can provide us a "preferred" status with our customers and thereby increase opportunities to win future business. We also utilize our LifeCycle Advantage program to establish fee-based contracts to manage customers’ aftermarket requirements. These programs provide an opportunity to manage the customer’s installed base and expand the business relationship with the customer.Our ability to use our portfolio of products, solutions and services to meet customer needs is a competitive strength. Our market approach is to create value for our customers throughout the life cycle of their investments in flow control management. We continue to explore and develop potential new offerings in conjunction with our customers. In the early phases of project design, we endeavor to create value in optimizing the selection of equipment for the customer’s specific application, as we are capable of providing technical expertise on product and system capabilities even outside the scope of our specific products, solutions and services. After the equipment is constructed and delivered to the customer’s site, we continue to create value through our aftermarket capabilities by optimizing the performance of the equipment over its operational life. Our skilled service personnel can provide these aftermarket services for our products, as well as many competitors’ products, within the installed base. This value is further enhanced by the global reach of our QRCs and, when combined with our other solutions for our customers’ flow control management needs, allows us to create value for our customers during all phases of the capital expenditure cycle.New Product DevelopmentWe spent $35.0 million, $29.5 million and $29.4 million during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, on R&D initiatives. Our R&D group consists of engineers involved in new product development and improvement of existing products. Additionally, we sponsor consortium programs for research with various universities and jointly conduct limited development work with certain vendors, licensees and customers. We believe current expenditures are adequate to sustain our ongoing and necessary future R&D activities. In addition, we work closely with our customers on customer-sponsored research activities to help execute their R&D initiatives in connection with our products and services. New product development in each of our three business segments is discussed in more detail under the "Business Segments" heading below.CustomersWe sell to a wide variety of customers globally including leading engineering, procurement and construction firms, original equipment manufacturers, distributors and end users in several distinct industries: oil and gas; chemical; power generation; water management; and a number of other industries that are collectively referred to as "general industries." No individual customer 5Table of Contentsaccounted for more than 10% of our consolidated 2011 revenues. Customer information relating to each of our three business segments is discussed in more detail under the "Business Segments" heading below.We are not normally required to carry unusually high amounts of inventory to meet customer delivery requirements, although higher backlog levels and longer lead times generally require higher amounts of inventory.  We receive advance cash payments from customers on longer lead time projects to help offset our investment in inventory.  We have initiated programs targeted at  improving our operational effectiveness to reduce our overall working capital needs. While we do provide cancellation policies through our contractual relationships, we generally do not provide rights of product return for our customers.Selling and DistributionWe primarily distribute our products through direct sales by employees assigned to specific regions, industries or products. In addition, we use distributors and sales representatives to supplement our direct sales force in countries where it is more appropriate due to business practices or customs, or whenever the use of direct sales staff is not economically efficient. We generate a majority of our sales leads through existing relationships with vendors, customers and prospects or through referrals.Intellectual PropertyWe own a number of trademarks and patents relating to the names and designs of our products. We consider our trademarks and patents to be valuable assets of our business. In addition, our pool of proprietary information, consisting of know-how and trade secrets related to the design, manufacture and operation of our products, is considered particularly valuable. Accordingly, we take proactive measures to protect such proprietary information. We generally own the rights to the products that we manufacture and sell and are unencumbered by licensing or franchise agreements. Our trademarks can typically be renewed indefinitely as long as they remain in use, whereas our existing patents generally expire 20 years from the dates they were filed, which has occurred at various times in the past. We do not believe that the expiration of any individual patent will have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or result of operations.Raw MaterialsThe principal raw materials used in manufacturing our products are readily available and include ferrous and non-ferrous metals in the form of bar stock, machined castings, fasteners, forgings and motors, as well as silicon, carbon faces, gaskets and fluoropolymer components. A substantial volume of our raw materials are purchased from outside sources, and we have been able to develop a robust supply chain and anticipate no significant shortages of such materials in the future. We continually monitor the business conditions of our suppliers to manage competitive market conditions and to avoid potential supply disruptions. We continue to expand global sourcing to capitalize on localization in emerging markets and low-cost sources of purchased goods balanced with efficient consolidated and compliant logistics.We are a vertically-integrated manufacturer of certain pump and valve products. Certain corrosion-resistant castings for our pumps and valves are manufactured at our foundries. Other metal castings are either manufactured at our foundries or purchased from qualified and approved foundry sources.Concerning the products we supply to customers in the nuclear power generation industry, suppliers of raw materials for nuclear power generation markets must be qualified to meet the requirements of nuclear industry standards and governmental regulations. Supply channels for these materials are currently adequate, and we do not anticipate difficulty in obtaining such materials in the future.Employees and Labor RelationsWe have approximately 16,000 employees globally. In the U.S., a portion of the hourly employees at our pump manufacturing plant located in Vernon, California, our pump service center located in Cleveland, Ohio, our valve manufacturing plant located in Lynchburg, Virginia and our foundry located in Dayton, Ohio, are represented by unions. Additionally, some employees at select facilities in the following countries are unionized or have employee works councils: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, The Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. We believe relations with our employees throughout our operations are generally satisfactory, including those employees represented by unions and employee works councils. No unionized facility accounts for more than 10% of our revenues.Environmental Regulations and ProceedingsWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations in all jurisdictions in which we have operating facilities. These requirements primarily relate to the generation and disposal of waste, air emissions and waste water discharges. We periodically make capital expenditures to enhance our compliance with environmental requirements, as well as to abate and control pollution. At present, we have no plans for any material capital expenditures for environmental control equipment at any of our facilities. 6Table of ContentsHowever, we have incurred and continue to incur operating costs relating to ongoing environmental compliance matters. Based on existing and proposed environmental requirements and our anticipated production schedule, we believe that future environmental compliance expenditures will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.We use hazardous substances and generate hazardous wastes in many of our manufacturing and foundry operations. Most of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes and some may require clean-up of historical contamination. During the due diligence phase of our acquisitions, we conduct environmental site assessments to identify potential environmental liabilities and required clean-up measures. We are currently conducting follow-up investigation and/or remediation activities at those locations where we have known environmental concerns. We have cleaned up a majority of the sites with known historical contamination and are addressing the remaining identified issues.Over the years, we have been involved as one of many potentially responsible parties ("PRP") at former public waste disposal sites that are or were subject to investigation and remediation. We are currently involved as a PRP at seven  Superfund sites. The sites are in various stages of evaluation by government authorities. Our total projected "fair share" cost allocation at these seven  sites is expected to be immaterial. See "Item 3. Legal Proceedings" included in this Annual Report for more information.We have established reserves that we currently believe to be adequate to cover our currently identified on-site and off-site environmental liabilities.ExportsOur export sales from the U.S. to foreign unaffiliated customers were $365.8 million in 2011, $300.3 million in 2010 and $339.6 million in 2009.Licenses are required from U.S. and other government agencies to export certain products. In particular, products with nuclear power generation and/or military applications are restricted, as are certain other pump, valve and seal products.We voluntarily self-disclosed to applicable U.S. governmental authorities the results of an audit of our compliance with U.S. export control laws and, in September 2011, entered into settlement agreements with U.S. governmental authorities that resolved in full all matters contained in our voluntary self-disclosures.  See "Item 3. Legal Proceedings" included in this Annual Report for more information.BUSINESS SEGMENTSIn addition to the business segment information presented below, Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report contains additional financial information about our business segments and geographic areas in which we have conducted business in 2011, 2010 and 2009.FSG ENGINEERED PRODUCT DIVISIONOur largest business segment is EPD, through which we design, manufacture, distribute and service engineered pumps and pump systems, mechanical seals, auxiliary systems, replacement parts and related equipment. The business primarily consists of long lead-time, highly engineered, custom configured products, which require extensive test requirements and superior project management skills. EPD products and services are primarily used by companies that operate in the oil and gas, power generation, chemical, water management and general industries. We market our pump and mechanical seal products through our worldwide sales force and our regional service and repair centers or through independent distributors and sales representatives. A portion of our mechanical seal products are sold directly to original equipment manufacturers for incorporation into rotating equipment requiring mechanical seals.Our pump products are manufactured in a wide range of metal alloys and with a variety of configurations to meet the critical operating demands of our customers. Mechanical seals are critical to the reliable operation of rotating equipment in that they prevent leakage and emissions of hazardous substances from the rotating equipment and reduce shaft wear on the equipment caused by the use of non-mechanical seals. We also manufacture a gas-lubricated mechanical seal that is used in high-speed compressors for gas pipelines and in the oil and gas production and process markets. Our products are currently manufactured at 28 plants worldwide, nine of which are located in Europe, 11 in North America, four in Asia Pacific and four in Latin America.We also conduct business through strategic foreign joint ventures. We have six unconsolidated joint ventures that are located in China, India, Japan, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates, where a portion of our products are manufactured, assembled or serviced in these territories. These relationships provide numerous strategic opportunities, including increased access to our current and new markets, access to additional manufacturing capacity and expansion of our operational platform to support low-cost sourcing initiatives and capacity demands for other markets.7Table of ContentsEPD ProductsWe manufacture more than 40 different active types of pumps and approximately 185 different models of mechanical seals and sealing systems. The following is a summary list of our EPD products and globally recognized brands:EPD Product TypesBetween Bearings Pumps Overhung Pumps•   Single Case — Axially Split •   API Process•   Single Case — Radially Split  •   Double Case  Positive Displacement Pumps Mechanical Seals and Seal Support Systems•   Multiphase •   Gas Barrier Seals•   Reciprocating •   Dry-Running Seals•   Screw  Specialty Products  •   Nuclear Pumps •   Power Recovery — DWEER•   Nuclear Seals •   Power Recovery — Hydroturbine•   Cryogenic Pumps •   Energy Recovery Devices•   Cryogenic Liquid Expander •   CVP Concrete Volute Pumps•   Hydraulic Decoking Systems •   Wireless Transmitters•   API Slurry Pumps  EPD Brand Names•   BW Seals •   Lawrence•   Byron Jackson •   LifeCycle Advantage•   Calder Energy Recovery Devices •   Niigata Worthington•   Cameron •   QRC™•   Durametallic •   Pacific•   FEDD Wireless •   Pacific Weits•   Five Star Seal •   Pac-Seal•   Flowserve •   ReadySeal•   Flowstar •   United Centrifugal•   GASPAC™ •   Western Land Roller•   IDP •   Wilson-Snyder•   Interseal •   Worthington•   Jeumont-Schneider •   Worthington-SimpsonEPD ServicesWe provide engineered aftermarket services through our global network of 120 QRCs, some of which are co-located in manufacturing facilities, in 41 countries. Our EPD service personnel provide a comprehensive set of equipment services for flow management control systems, including installation, commissioning, repair, advanced diagnostics, re-rate and retrofit programs, machining and comprehensive asset management solutions. We provide asset management services and condition monitoring for rotating equipment through special contracts with many of our customers that reduce maintenance costs. A large portion of EPD’s service work is performed on a quick response basis, and we offer 24-hour service in all of our major markets.EPD New Product DevelopmentOur investments in new product R&D continue to focus on increasing the capability of our products as customer applications become more advanced, demanding greater levels of production (i.e., flow, power and pressure) and under more extreme conditions beyond the level of traditional technology. We continue to develop innovations that improve product performance and our competitive position in the engineered equipment industry, specifically targeting pipeline, off-shore and downstream applications for the oil and gas market.  The emergence of extreme pressure applications prompted the development of an advanced stage 8Table of Contentsdesign and construction of high pressure test capability necessary to validate the technology prior to introduction into the market.  Successful completion of the multiphase testing, as part of the subsea product development, validated our design predictions and established the baseline for future advances in subsea and land-based designs of this product.  As new sources of energy generation are explored, we have been developing new product designs to support the most critical applications in the power generation market. New designs and qualification test programs continue to support the critical services found in the modern nuclear power generation plant. In addition to nuclear pump product development, we have focused development efforts on an advanced seal design required to accommodate upset conditions recently identified by the nuclear industry.  As Calder AG ("Calder") is now integrated into the product family, investment in work exchanger technology has led to development of advanced analytical methods for predicting performance and application on a new rotating valve design.  This advanced technology is expected to improve our competitive position in the reverse osmosis water plant energy recovery application.  Continued engagement with our end users is exemplified through completion of advancements in coke cutting technology, nozzle design and auxiliary equipment improvements, as well as creation of an automated cutting system to improve operator safety.     We continue to address our core products with design enhancements to improve performance and the speed at which we can deliver our products. Application of advanced computational fluid dynamics methods utilizing unsteady flow analysis led to the development of an advanced inlet chamber and impeller vane design for high energy injection water pumps. Our engineering teams continue to apply and develop sophisticated design technology and methods supporting continuous improvement of our proven technology. In 2011, EPD continued to advance our Technology Advantage platform through the Integrated Solutions Organization ("ISO"). This platform utilizes a combination of our developed technologies and leading edge technology partners to increase our asset management and service capabilities for our end user customers. These technologies include intelligent devices, advanced communication and security protocols, wireless and satellite communications and web-enabled data convergence.None of these newly developed products or services required the investment of a material amount of our assets or was otherwise material.EPD CustomersOur customer mix is diversified and includes leading engineering, procurement and construction firms, original equipment manufacturers, distributors and end users. Our sales mix of original equipment products and aftermarket products and services diversifies our business and somewhat mitigates the impact of normal economic cycles on our business. Our sales are diversified among several industries, including oil and gas, power generation, chemical, water management and general industries.EPD CompetitionThe pump and mechanical seal industry is highly fragmented, with hundreds of competitors. We compete, however, primarily with a limited number of large companies operating on a global scale. Competition among our closest competitors is generally driven by delivery times, expertise, price, breadth of product offerings, contractual terms, previous installation history and reputation for quality. Some of our largest industry competitors include: Sulzer Pumps; Ebara Corp.; SPX Corp.; Eagle Burgmann, which is a joint venture of two traditional global seal manufacturers, A. W. Chesterton Co. and AES Corp.; John Crane Inc., a unit of Smiths Group Plc; and Weir Group Plc.The pump and mechanical seal industry continues to undergo considerable consolidation, which is primarily driven by (i) the need to lower costs through reduction of excess capacity and (ii) customers’ preference to align with global full service suppliers to simplify their supplier base. Despite the consolidation activity, the market remains highly competitive.  We believe that our strongest sources of competitive advantage rest with our extensive range of pumps for the oil and gas, chemical and power generation industries, our large installed base, our strong customer relationships, our more than 200 years of legacy experience in manufacturing and servicing pumping equipment, our reputation for providing quality engineering solutions and our ability to deliver engineered new seal product orders within 72 hours from the customer’s request through design, engineering, manufacturing, testing and delivery.EPD BacklogEPD’s backlog of orders as of December 31, 2011 was $1.4 billion (including $19.9 million of interdivision backlog, which is eliminated and not included in consolidated backlog), compared with $1.4 billion (including $25.5 million of interdivision backlog) as of December 31, 2010. We expect to ship 85% of December 31, 2011 backlog during 2012.9Table of ContentsFSG INDUSTRIAL PRODUCT DIVISIONThrough IPD we design, manufacture, distribute and service pre-configured engineered pumps and pump systems, including submersible motors, for industrial markets. Our globalized operating platform, low-cost sourcing and continuous improvement initiatives are essential aspects of this business. IPD’s standardized, general purpose pump products are primarily utilized by the oil and gas, chemical, water management, power generation and general industries.

A new product for the International Standards Organization (ISO) market is being developed for release in 2012 and is positioned to be a globally-accepted product supporting the chemical industry.  Investment in a modern multistage ring section design progressed through the year with advanced construction and prototype testing. The new design is expected to streamline our product portfolio.  10Table of ContentsWe continue to address our core products with design enhancements to improve performance and the speed at which we can deliver our products. Successful testing of permanent magnet motor technology in our submersible motor products demonstrated improved product efficiency. In addition, canned motor technology utilizing a permanent magnet motor was demonstrated in our test facility. Cost reduction projects incorporating product rationalization, value engineering, lean manufacturing and overhead reduction continue to be key drivers for IPD.None of these newly developed products or services required the investment of a material amount of our assets or was otherwise material.IPD CustomersOur customer mix is diversified and includes leading engineering, procurement and construction firms, original equipment manufacturers, distributors and end users. Our sales mix of original equipment products and aftermarket products and services diversifies our business and helps mitigate the impact of normal economic cycles on our business. Our sales are diversified among several industries, including oil and gas, water management, chemical, power generation and general industries.IPD CompetitionThe industrial pump industry is highly fragmented, with many competitors. We compete, however, primarily with a limited number of large companies operating on a global scale. Competition among our closest competitors is generally driven by delivery times, expertise, price, breadth of product offerings, contractual terms, previous installation history and reputation for quality. Some of our largest industry competitors include ITT Industries, KSB Inc. and Sulzer Pumps.We believe that our strongest sources of competitive advantage rest with our extensive range of pumps for the chemical industry, our large installed base, our strong customer relationships, our more than 200 years of legacy experience in manufacturing and servicing pumping equipment and our reputation for providing quality engineering solutions.IPD BacklogIPD’s backlog of orders as of December 31, 2011 was $567.8 million (including $56.7 million of interdivision backlog, which is eliminated and not included in consolidated backlog), compared with $568.0 million (including $38.5 million of interdivision backlog) as of December 31, 2010. We expect to ship 89% of December 31, 2011 backlog during 2012.FLOW CONTROL DIVISIONFCD designs, manufactures, distributes and services a broad portfolio of industrial valve and automation solutions, including isolation and control valves, actuation, controls and related equipment. In addition, FCD offers energy management products such as steam traps, boiler controls and condensate and energy recovery systems. FCD leverages its experience and application know-how by offering a complete menu of engineering and project management services to complement its expansive product portfolio. FCD products are used to control, direct and manage the flow of liquids and gases and are an integral part of any flow control system. Our valve products are most often customized and engineered to perform specific functions within each customer’s unique flow control environment.Our flow control products are primarily used by companies operating in the chemical (including pharmaceutical), power generation (nuclear, fossil and renewable), oil and gas, water management and general industries, including aerospace, pulp and paper and mining. FCD has 55 sites worldwide, including 25 principal manufacturing facilities (five of which are located in the U.S. and 14 of which are located in Europe) and 30 QRCs, including three consolidated joint ventures. A small portion of our valves are also produced through an unconsolidated foreign joint venture in India.FCD ProductsOur valve, automation and controls product and solutions portfolio represents one of the most comprehensive in the flow control industry. Our products are used in a wide variety of applications, from general service to the most severe and demanding services, including those involving high levels of corrosion, extreme temperatures and/or pressures, zero fugitive emissions and emergency shutdown.Our “smart” valve and diagnostic technologies integrate sensors, microprocessor controls and software into high performance integrated control valves, digital positioners and switchboxes for automated on/off valve assemblies and electric actuators. These technologies permit real-time system analysis, system warnings and remote indication of asset health. These technologies have been developed in response to the growing demand for reduced maintenance, improved process control efficiency and digital communications at the plant level. We are committed to further enhancing the quality of our product portfolio by continuing to upgrade our existing offerings with cutting-edge technologies.11Table of ContentsOur valve automation products encompass a broad range of pneumatic, electric, hydraulic and stored energy actuation designs to take advantage of whatever power source the customer has available. FCD’s actuation products can even utilize the process fluid flowing through the pipeline as a source of power to actuate the valve. Our actuation products also cover one of the widest ranges of output torques in the industry, providing the ability to automate anything from the smallest linear globe valve to the largest multi-turn gate valve. Most importantly, FCD combines best-in-class mechanical designs with the latest in digital controls in order to provide complete integrated automation solutions that optimize the combined valve-actuator-controls package.The following is a summary list of our generally available valve and automation products and globally recognized brands:FCD Product Types•   Valve Automation Systems •   Digital Positioners•   Control Valves •   Pneumatic Positioners•   Ball Valves •   Intelligent Positioners•   Gate Valves •   Electric/Electronic Actuators•   Globe Valves •   Pneumatic Actuators•   Check Valves •   Hydraulic Actuators•   Butterfly Valves •   Diaphragm Actuators•   Lined Plug Valves •   Direct Gas and Gas-over-Oil Actuators•   Lined Ball Valves •   Limit Switches•   Lubricated Plug Valves •   Steam Traps•   Non-Lubricated Plug Valves •   Condensate and Energy Recovery Systems•   Integrated Valve Controllers •   Boiler Controls•   Diagnostic Software •   Digital Communications•   Electro Pneumatic Positioners •   Valve and Automation Repair ServicesFCD Brand Names•   Accord •   NAF•   Anchor/Darling •   NAVAL•   Argus •   Noble Alloy•   Atomac •   Norbro•   Automax •   Nordstrom•   Durco •   PMV•   Edward •   Serck Audco•   Flowserve •   Schmidt Armaturen•   Gestra •   Valbart•   Kammer •   Valtek•   Limitorque •   Vogt•   McCANNA/MARPAC •   Worcester ControlsFCD ServicesOur service personnel provide comprehensive equipment maintenance services for flow control systems, including advanced diagnostics, repair, installation, commissioning, retrofit programs and field machining capabilities. A large portion of our service work is performed on a quick response basis, which includes 24-hour service in all of our major markets. We also provide in-house repair and return manufacturing services worldwide through our manufacturing facilities. We believe our ability to offer comprehensive, quick turnaround services provides us with a unique competitive advantage and unparalleled access to our customers’ installed base of flow control products.FCD New Product DevelopmentOur R&D investment is focused on areas that will advance our technological leadership and further differentiate our competitive advantage from a product perspective. Investment has been focused on significantly enhancing the digital integration and interoperability of valve top works (e.g., positioners, actuators, limit switches and associated accessories) with Distributed Control Systems ("DCS"). We continue to pursue the development and deployment of next-generation hardware and software for 12Table of Contentsvalve diagnostics and the integration of the resulting device intelligence through the DCS to provide a practical and effective asset management capability for the end user. In addition to developing these new capabilities and value-added services, our investments also include product portfolio expansion and fundamental research in material sciences in order to increase the temperature, pressure and corrosion/erosion-resistance limits of existing products, as well as noise and cavitation reduction. These investments are made by adding new resources and talent to the organization, as well as leveraging the experience of EPD and IPD and increasing our collaboration with third parties. We expect to continue our R&D investments in the areas discussed above.None of these newly developed valve products or services required the investment of a material amount of our assets or was otherwise material.FCD CustomersOur customer mix spans several markets, including the chemical, oil and gas, power generation, water management, pulp and paper, mining and other general industries. Our product mix includes original equipment and aftermarket parts and services. FCD contracts with a variety of customers, ranging from engineering, procurement and construction firms, to distributors, end users and other original equipment manufacturers.FCD CompetitionWhile in recent years the valve market has undergone a significant amount of consolidation, the market remains highly fragmented. Some of the largest valve industry competitors include Tyco International Ltd., Cameron International Corp., Emerson Electric Co., General Electric Co. and Crane Co.Our market research and assessments indicate that the top 10 global valve manufacturers collectively comprise less than 25% of the total valve market. Based on independent industry sources, we believe that we are the fourth largest industrial valve supplier in the world. We believe that our strongest sources of competitive advantage rest with our comprehensive portfolio of valve products and services, our focus on execution and our expertise in severe corrosion and erosion applications.FCD BacklogFCD’s backlog of orders as of December 31, 2011 was $759.9 million, compared with $658.5 million as of December 31, 2010. We expect to ship 88% of December 31, 2011 backlog during 2012.AVAILABLE INFORMATIONWe maintain an Internet web site at www.flowserve.com.

If they do, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business operations. Because of these risk factors, as well as other variables affecting our operating results, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.Our business depends on the levels of capital investment and maintenance expenditures by our customers, which in turn are affected by numerous factors, including the state of domestic and global economies, global energy demand, the cyclical nature of their markets, their liquidity and the condition of global credit and capital markets.Demand for most of our products and services depends on the level of new capital investment and planned maintenance 13Table of Contentsexpenditures by our customers. The level of capital expenditures by our customers depends, in turn, on general economic conditions, availability of credit, economic conditions within their respective industries and expectations of future market behavior. Additionally, volatility in commodity prices can negatively affect the level of these activities and can result in postponement of capital spending decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders. The ability of our customers to finance capital investment and maintenance may also be affected by factors independent of the conditions in their industry, such as the condition of global credit and capital markets.The businesses of many of our customers, particularly oil and gas companies, chemical companies and general industrial companies, are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns. Our customers in these industries, particularly those whose demand for our products and services is primarily profit-driven, historically have tended to delay large capital projects, including expensive maintenance and upgrades, during economic downturns. For example, our chemical customers generally tend to reduce their spending on capital investments and operate their facilities at lower levels in a soft economic environment, which reduces demand for our products and services. Additionally, fluctuating energy demand forecasts and lingering uncertainty concerning commodity pricing can cause our customers to be more conservative in their capital planning, which may reduce demand for our products and services. Reduced demand for our products and services could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess manufacturing capacity, which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs. This reduced demand may also erode average selling prices in our industry. Any of these results could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Additionally, some of our customers may delay capital investment and maintenance even during favorable conditions in their markets. The health of global credit and capital markets and our customers' ability to access such markets can have an impact on investment in large capital projects, including necessary maintenance and upgrades, even during favorable market conditions. In addition, the liquidity and financial position of our customers could impact their ability to pay in full and/or on a timely basis. Any of these factors, whether individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our customers and, in turn, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Volatility in commodity prices, effects from credit and capital market disruptions and a sluggish global economic recovery could prompt customers to delay or cancel existing orders, which could adversely affect the viability of our backlog and could impede our ability to realize revenues on our backlog.Our backlog represents the value of uncompleted customer orders. While we cannot be certain that reported backlog will be indicative of future results, our ability to accurately value our backlog can be adversely affected by numerous factors, including the health of our customers' businesses and their access to capital, volatility in commodity prices (e.g., copper, nickel, stainless steel) and economic uncertainty. While we attempt to mitigate the financial consequences of order delays and cancellations through contractual provisions and other means, if we were to experience a significant increase in order delays or cancellations that can result from the aforementioned economic conditions or other factors beyond our control, it could impede or delay our ability to realize anticipated revenues on our backlog. Such a loss of anticipated revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We may be unable to deliver our sizeable backlog on time, which could affect our revenues, future sales and profitability and our relationships with customers.At December 31, 2011, backlog was $2.7 billion. In 2012, our ability to meet customer delivery schedules for backlog is dependent on a number of factors including, but not limited to, sufficient manufacturing plant capacity, adequate supply channel access to the raw materials and other inventory required for production, an adequately trained and capable workforce, project engineering expertise for certain large projects and appropriate planning and scheduling of manufacturing resources. Many of the contracts we enter into with our customers require long manufacturing lead times and contain penalty clauses related to on-time delivery. Failure to deliver in accordance with customer expectations could subject us to financial penalties, may result in damage to existing customer relationships and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We sell our products in highly competitive markets, which results in pressure on our profit margins and limits our ability to maintain or increase the market share of our products.The markets for our products and services are geographically diverse and highly competitive. We compete against large and well-established national and global companies, as well as regional and local companies, low-cost replicators of spare parts and in-house maintenance departments of our end user customers. We compete based on price, technical expertise, timeliness of delivery, contractual terms, previous installation history and reputation for quality and reliability. Competitive environments in slow growth industries and for original equipment orders have been inherently more influenced by pricing and domestic and global economic conditions during 2011, and current economic forecasts suggest that the competitive influence of pricing has broadened. 14Table of ContentsAdditionally, some of our customers have been attempting to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase in order to reduce the size and diversity of their inventory. To remain competitive, we must invest in manufacturing, marketing, customer service and support and our distribution networks. No assurances can be made that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make the investment required to maintain or increase our market share or that our investments will be successful. If we do not compete successfully, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.If we are unable to obtain raw materials at favorable prices, our operating margins and results of operations may be adversely affected.We purchase substantially all electric power and other raw materials we use in the manufacturing of our products from outside sources. The costs of these raw materials have been volatile historically and are influenced by factors that are outside our control. In recent years, the prices for energy, metal alloys, nickel and certain other of our raw materials have been volatile. While we strive to offset our increased costs through supply chain management, contractual provisions and our CIP initiative, where gains are achieved in operational efficiencies, our operating margins and results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected if we are unable to pass increases in the costs of our raw materials on to our customers or operational efficiencies are not achieved.Economic, political and other risks associated with international operations could adversely affect our business.A substantial portion of our operations is conducted and located outside the U.S. We have manufacturing, sales or service facilities in more than 50 countries and sell to customers in over 90 countries, in addition to the U.S. Moreover, we primarily outsource certain of our manufacturing and engineering functions to, and source our raw materials and components from, China, Eastern Europe, India, Latin America and Mexico. Accordingly, our business and results of operations are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including:•instability in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions, particularly economic conditions in Europe, and political conditions in the Middle East, North Africa and other emerging markets;•trade protection measures, such as tariff increases, and import and export licensing and control requirements;•potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws or tax examinations;•difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;•difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through some foreign legal systems;•differing and, in some cases, more stringent labor regulations;•partial or total expropriation;•differing protection of intellectual property;•inability to repatriate income or capital; and•difficulty in administering and enforcing corporate policies, which may be different than the customary business practices of local cultures.For example, political unrest or work stoppages could negatively impact the demand for our products from customers in affected countries and other customers, such as U.S. oil refineries, that could be affected by the resulting disruption in the supply of crude oil. Similarly, military conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa and our customers' potential exposures to sovereign and non-sovereign debt in Europe could soften the level of capital investment and demand for our products and services. In order to manage our day-to-day operations, we must overcome cultural and language barriers and assimilate different business practices. In addition, we are required to create compensation programs, employment policies and other administrative programs that comply with laws of multiple countries. We also must communicate and monitor standards and directives across our global network. Our failure to successfully manage our geographically diverse operations could impair our ability to react quickly to changing business and market conditions and to enforce compliance with standards and procedures.Our future success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations. Any of these factors could, however, materially adversely affect our international operations and, consequently, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.15Table of ContentsOur international operations and foreign subsidiaries are subject to a variety of complex and continually changing laws and regulations.Due to the international scope of our operations, the system of laws and regulations to which we are subject is complex and includes, without limitation, regulations issued by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security, the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control and various foreign governmental agencies, including applicable export controls, customs, currency exchange control and transfer pricing regulations, as applicable. No assurances can be made that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with, or be able to detect violations of, any such laws or regulations. In addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.We are also subject to risks associated with certain of our foreign subsidiaries autonomously making sales and providing related services, under their own local authority, to customers in countries that have been designated by the U.S. State Department as state sponsors of terrorism, including Iran, Syria and Sudan. Due to the growing political uncertainties associated with these countries, in 2006, our foreign subsidiaries began a voluntary withdrawal, on a phased basis, from conducting new business in these countries. The aggregate amount of all business done by our foreign subsidiaries for customers in Iran, Syria and Sudan accounted for less than 0.3% of our consolidated revenue in 2011. Effective January 1, 2012, our foreign subsidiaries substantially completed the winding down of business in these countries. Our foreign subsidiaries' remaining activities in Iran, Sudan and Syria are limited to ongoing wrap-up activities such as attempts to collect accounts receivable, resolution of bank guarantee and bond issues, government mandated inspections and payment of any outstanding agent commissions, which we plan to conclude as soon as possible.Our international operations expose us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.A significant portion of our revenue and certain of our costs, assets and liabilities, are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The primary currencies to which we have exposure are the Euro, British pound, Mexican peso, Brazilian real, Indian rupee, Japanese yen, Singapore dollar, Argentine peso, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Chinese yuan, Colombian peso, Chilean peso and South African rand. Certain of the foreign currencies to which we have exposure, such as the Venezuelan bolivar, have undergone significant devaluation in the past, which can reduce the value of our local monetary assets, reduce the U.S. dollar value of our local cash flow, generate local currency losses that may impact our ability to pay future dividends from our subsidiary to the parent company and potentially reduce the U.S. dollar value of future local net income. Although we enter into forward exchange contracts to economically hedge some of our risks associated with transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies, no assurances can be made that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws and regulations.The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") and similar anti-bribery laws and regulations (e.g., the UK Bribery Act) in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing an improper business advantage. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws worldwide. We operate in many parts of the world and sell to industries that have experienced corruption to some degree. If we are found to be liable for FCPA or other similar anti-bribery law or regulatory violations, whether due to our or others' actions or inadvertence, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Terrorist acts, conflicts and wars may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and may adversely affect the market for our common stock.As a multi-national company with a large international footprint, we are subject to increased risk of damage or disruption to us, our employees, facilities, partners, suppliers, distributors, resellers or customers due to terrorist acts, conflicts and wars, wherever located around the world. The potential for future attacks, the national and international responses to attacks or perceived threats to national security, and other actual or potential conflicts or wars, including the Israeli-Hamas conflict and ongoing military operations in the Middle East at large, have created many economic and political uncertainties. In addition, as a multi-national company with headquarters and significant operations located in the U.S., actions against or by the U.S. may impact our business or employees. Although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events, they could result in a decrease in demand for our products, make it difficult or impossible to deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers, create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain and pose risks to our employees, resulting in the need to impose travel restrictions, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.16Table of ContentsEnvironmental compliance costs and liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our operations and properties are subject to regulation under environmental laws, which can impose substantial sanctions for violations. We must conform our operations to applicable regulatory requirements and adapt to changes in such requirements in all countries in which we operate.We use hazardous substances and generate hazardous wastes in many of our manufacturing and foundry operations. Most of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes, and some may require clean-up of historical contamination. We are currently conducting investigation and/or remediation activities at a number of locations where we have known environmental concerns. In addition, we have been identified as one of many PRPs at seven Superfund sites. The projected cost of remediation at these sites, as well as our alleged "fair share" allocation, while not anticipated to be material, has been reserved. However, until all studies have been completed and the parties have either negotiated an amicable resolution or the matter has been judicially resolved, some degree of uncertainty remains.We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, operating and capital costs to comply with environmental requirements. In addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing requirements, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities. Moreover, environmental and sustainability initiatives, practices, rules and regulations are under increasing scrutiny of both governmental and non-governmental bodies, which can cause rapid change in operational practices, standards and expectations and, in turn, increase our compliance costs. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We are party to asbestos-containing product litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We are a defendant in a substantial number of lawsuits that seek to recover damages for personal injury allegedly resulting from exposure to asbestos-containing products formerly manufactured and/or distributed by us. Such products were used as internal components of process equipment, and we do not believe that there was any significant emission of asbestos-containing fibers during the use of this equipment. Although we are defending these allegations vigorously and believe that a high percentage of these lawsuits are covered by insurance or indemnities from other companies, there can be no assurance that we will prevail or that payments made by insurance or such other companies would be adequate. Unfavorable rulings, judgments or settlement terms could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our business may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters.As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately 16,000 employees, of which approximately 5,000 were located in the U.S. Approximately 7% of our U.S. employees are represented by unions. We also have unionized employees or employee work councils in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, The Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom ("U.K."). No unionized facility produces more than 10% of our revenues. Although we believe that our relations with our employees are strong and we have not experienced any material strikes or work stoppages recently, no assurances can be made that we will not in the future experience these and other types of conflicts with labor unions, works councils, other groups representing employees or our employees generally, or that any future negotiations with our labor unions will not result in significant increases in our cost of labor.Inability to protect our intellectual property could negatively affect our competitive position.We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We cannot guarantee, however, that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent infringement of our rights or misappropriation of our technology. For example, effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some of the foreign countries in which we operate. In addition, while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property, such confidentiality agreements could be breached or otherwise may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and know-how related to the design, manufacture or operation of our products. If it became necessary for us to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights, any proceedings could be burdensome and costly, and we may not prevail. Further, adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise. If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.17Table of ContentsSignificant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions changes may have a material effect on the valuation of our obligations under our defined benefit pension plans, the funded status of these plans and our pension expense.We maintain defined benefit pension plans that are required to be funded in the U.S., India, Japan, Mexico, The Netherlands and the U.K., and defined benefit plans that are not required to be funded in Austria, France, Germany and Sweden. Our pension liability is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure our pension obligations and, in the case of the plans that are required to be funded, the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. A change in the discount rate can result in a significant increase or decrease in the valuation of pension obligations, affecting the reported status of our pension plans and our pension expense. Significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets, for example the significant concentration of U.K. equity and fixed income securities in our non-U.S. defined benefit plans, can result in increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets or in a change of the expected rate of return on plan assets. Changes in the expected return on plan assets assumption can result in significant changes in our pension expense and future funding requirements.We continually review our funding policy related to our U.S. pension plan in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The impact of the performance of global financial markets in recent years has reduced the value of investments held in trust to support pension plans. Additionally, U.S. regulations are continually increasing the minimum level of funding for U.S pension plans. The combined impact of these changes has required significant contributions to our pension plans in recent years, which is likely to continue, albeit to a lesser extent, in 2012. Contributions to our pension plans reduce the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, R&D efforts and other general corporate purposes.We may incur material costs as a result of product liability and warranty claims, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We may be exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the event that the use of one of our products results in, or is alleged to result in, bodily injury and/or property damage or our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected. While we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability claims, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims. In addition, product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome. An unsuccessful defense of a product liability claim could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products, claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and our company. Warranty claims are not generally covered by insurance, and we may incur significant warranty costs in the future for which we would not be reimbursed.The recording of increased deferred tax asset valuation allowances in the future could affect our operating results.We currently have significant net deferred tax assets resulting from tax credit carryforwards, net operating losses and other deductible temporary differences that are available to reduce taxable income in future periods. Based on our assessment of our deferred tax assets, we determined, based on projected future income and certain available tax planning strategies, that approximately $239 million of our deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized in the future, and no valuation allowance is currently required for this portion of our deferred tax assets. Should we determine in the future that these assets will not be realized, we will be required to record an additional valuation allowance in connection with these deferred tax assets and our operating results would be adversely affected in the period such determination is made.Our outstanding indebtedness and the restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness limit our operating and financial flexibility.We are required to make scheduled repayments and, under certain events of default, mandatory repayments on our outstanding indebtedness, which may require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes, such as dividend payments and share repurchases, and could generally limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry.In addition, the agreements governing our bank credit facilities impose certain operating and financial restrictions on us and somewhat limit management's discretion in operating our businesses. These agreements limit or restrict our ability, among other things, to: incur additional debt; change fiscal year; pay dividends and make other distributions; prepay subordinated debt, make investments and other restricted payments; create liens; sell assets; and enter into transactions with affiliates.Our bank credit facilities also contain covenants requiring us to deliver to lenders certificates of compliance with leverage and interest coverage financial covenants and our audited annual and unaudited quarterly financial statements. Our ability to 18Table of Contentscomply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We may not be able to continue to expand our market presence through acquisitions, and any future acquisitions may present unforeseen integration difficulties or costs.Since 1997, we have expanded through a number of acquisitions, and we may pursue strategic acquisitions of businesses in the future. Our ability to implement this growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition candidates, covenants in our credit agreement and other debt agreements and our financial resources, including available cash and borrowing capacity. Acquisitions may require additional debt financing, resulting in higher leverage and an increase in interest expense. In addition, acquisitions may require large one-time charges and can result in the incurrence of contingent liabilities, adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges, the amortization of identifiable purchased intangible assets or impairment of goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Should we acquire another business, the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may create operating difficulties and may require significant financial and managerial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations. Some of the more common challenges associated with acquisitions that we may experience include:•loss of key employees or customers of the acquired company;•conforming the acquired company's standards, processes, procedures and controls, including accounting systems and controls, with our operations, which could cause deficiencies related to our internal control over financial reporting;•coordinating operations that are increased in scope, geographic diversity and complexity;•retooling and reprogramming of equipment;•hiring additional management and other critical personnel; and•the diversion of management's attention from our day-to-day operations.Further, no guarantees can be made that we would realize the cost savings, synergies or revenue enhancements that we may anticipate from any acquisition, or that we will realize such benefits within the time frame that we expect. If we are not able to timely address the challenges associated with acquisitions and successfully integrate acquired businesses, or if our integrated product and service offerings fail to achieve market acceptance, our business could be adversely affected.Forward-Looking Information is Subject to Risk and UncertaintyThis Annual Report and other written reports and oral statements we make from time-to-time include “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
