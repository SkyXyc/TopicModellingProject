:Risk FactorsThe following factors could materially affect Applied’s business, financial condition or results of operations and should be carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its business.The industries that Applied serves are volatile and difficult to predict.As a supplier to the global semiconductor, flat panel display, and solar industries, Applied is subject to business cycles, the timing, length and volatility of which can be difficult to predict and which vary by reportable segment. These industries historically have been cyclical due to sudden changes in customers’ requirements for new manufacturing capacity and advanced technology, which depend in part on customers’ capacity utilization, production volumes, access to affordable capital, end-use demand, and inventory levels relative to demand, as well as the rate of technology transitions and general economic conditions. These changes have affected the timing and amounts of customers’ purchases and investments in technology, and continue to affect Applied’s orders, net sales, operating expenses and net income.  More recently, consumer buying patterns for electronic products, combined with growing customer concentration, have led to a seasonality effect in demand for semiconductor equipment, particularly from foundry customers.To meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves, Applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity for each of its segments as well as across multiple segments, and may incur unexpected or additional costs to align its business operations. During periods of decreasing demand, Applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions; effectively manage its supply chain; and motivate and retain key employees. During periods of increasing demand for its products, Applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand; effectively manage its supply chain; attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees; and continue to control costs. If Applied does not accurately forecast and timely and appropriately adapt to changes in its business environment, Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.Applied is exposed to risks associated with the uncertain global economy.Uncertain global economic conditions and slowing or negative growth in China, Europe, and the United States, along with continuing difficulties in the financial markets, national debt and fiscal concerns in various regions (including a potential “fiscal cliff” in the U.S. if remedial legislation is not enacted by December 31, 2012), and government austerity measures, are posing challenges to the industries in which Applied operates. The markets for semiconductors and flat panel displays in particular depend largely on consumer spending, while the solar market depends in part on government incentives and the availability of financing for PV installations. Economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain Applied customers to push out, cancel, or refrain from placing orders for equipment or services, which may in turn reduce Applied's net sales, reduce backlog, and affect Applied’s ability to convert backlog to sales. Uncertain market conditions, difficulties in obtaining capital, or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, which can also result in lower sales and/or additional inventory or bad debt expense for Applied. These conditions may similarly affect key suppliers, which could impair their ability to deliver parts and result in delays for Applied’s products or added costs. In addition, these conditions may lead to strategic alliances by, or consolidation of, other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect Applied’s ability to compete effectively.Uncertainty about future economic and industry conditions also makes it more challenging for Applied to forecast its operating results, make business decisions, and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses, sources and uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations. Applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts, including restructuring activities, which may adversely affect Applied’s ability to capitalize on opportunities in a market recovery. In addition, Applied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit, liquidity, foreign exchange, market and interest rate risks. The risks to Applied’s investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate and, as a result, the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio, as well as returns on pension assets, could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges. Applied also maintains cash balances in various bank accounts globally in order to fund normal operations. If any of these financial institutions becomes insolvent, it could limit Applied’s ability to access cash in the affected accounts.18Table of ContentsIf Applied does not timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from the uncertain macroeconomic environment and industry conditions, or to difficulties in the financial markets, Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the various industries in which it operates.The global semiconductor, flat panel display, solar and related industries in which Applied operates are characterized by ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries, including:•the nature and timing of changes in end demand for electronic products, including those related to fluctuations in consumer buying patterns tied to seasonality or the introduction of new products, and the effects of these changes on customers’ businesses and, in turn, on demand for Applied’s products;•increasing capital requirements for building and operating new fabrication plants and customers’ ability to raise the necessary capital, particularly when financial market conditions are difficult;•differences in growth rates among the semiconductor, display and solar industries;•the increasing importance of establishing, improving and maintaining strong relationships with customers;•the increasing cost and complexity for customers to move from product design to volume manufacturing, which may slow the adoption rate of new manufacturing technology;•the need to continually reduce the total cost of manufacturing system ownership, due in part to greater demand for lower-cost consumer electronics compared to business information technology spending;•the heightened importance to customers of system reliability and productivity and the effect on demand for fabrication systems as a result of their increasing productivity, device yield and reliability;•the increasing importance of, and difficulties in, developing products with sufficient differentiation to influence customers’ purchasing decisions;•requirements for shorter cycle times for the development, manufacture and installation of manufacturing equipment;•price and performance trends for semiconductor devices, LCDs and solar PVs, and the corresponding effect on demand for such products;•the increasing importance of the availability of spare parts to maximize the time that customers’ systems are available for production;•the increasing role for and complexity of software in Applied products; and•the increasing focus on reducing energy usage and improving the environmental impact and sustainability associated with manufacturing operations.If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from the ongoing changes in the semiconductor, flat panel display, solar and related industries, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the semiconductor industry.The largest proportion of Applied’s consolidated net sales and profitability has been and continues to be derived from sales of manufacturing equipment by the Silicon Systems Group to the global semiconductor industry. In addition, a majority of the revenues of Applied Global Services is from sales of service products to semiconductor manufacturers. The semiconductor industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to that industry in addition to the general industry changes described in the preceding risk factor, including:•the increasing cost of research and development due to many factors, including: decreasing linewidths on a chip, the use of new materials such as cobalt and yttrium, new and more complex device structures, more applications and process steps, increasing chip design costs, and the increasing cost and complexity of integrated manufacturing processes;•the need to reduce product development time, despite the increasing difficulty of technical challenges;•the growing number of types and varieties of semiconductors and number of applications across multiple substrate sizes;•the increasing cost and complexity for semiconductor manufacturers to move more technically advanced capability and smaller linewidths to volume manufacturing, and the resulting impact on the rates of technology transition and investment in capital equipment;•challenges in generating organic growth given semiconductor manufacturers’ decreasing capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue, and their increasing capital investment in market segments that Applied does not serve, such as lithography, or segments where Applied's products have lower relative market share;19Table of Contents•the importance of increasing market positions in under-penetrated segments, such as etch and inspection;•the growing demand for mobility products, such as tablets and smartphones, and corresponding industry investment in devices that require fewer Applied products to manufacture, such as NAND flash memory, than are needed to make  devices used in other applications, such as DRAM for personal computers; •the adoption of cloud-based memory storage particularly for mobility products, and the associated inhibiting effect on NAND bit growth rates;•the increasing frequency and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, such as 3-D transistors and advanced interconnects;•shorter cycle times between order placements by customers (particularly foundries) and product shipment, which may lead to inventory write-offs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease gross margin;•competitive factors that make it difficult to enhance market share, including challenges in securing development-tool-of-record (DTOR) and production-tool-of-record (PTOR) positions with customers;•potential shifts in sourcing strategies by a major computer and electronics company that may impact the equipment requirements of Applied's foundry customers;•the concentration of new wafer starts in Korea, where Applied’s service penetration and service-revenue-per-wafer-start have been lower than in other regions; and•the increasing fragmentation of semiconductor markets, leading certain markets to become too small to support the cost of a new fabrication plant, while others require less technologically advanced products.Applied must accurately forecast, and allocate appropriate resources and investment towards addressing, key technology changes and inflections, such as the transition to 20nm devices, in order to enable opportunities for market share gains. In addition, the proposed industry transition from 300mm to 450mm wafers presents opportunities as well as risks and uncertainties, including those related to cost, technical complexity, timing, and the resulting effect on demand for manufacturing equipment and services.  Recently, several semiconductor customers have invested in another wafer fabrication equipment supplier to help fund development of 450mm and other new technologies, which may influence the timing of technology transitions, funding allocations or other matters. If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from these and other ongoing changes occurring in the semiconductor industry, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the solar industry.Investment levels in capital equipment for the global solar industry have experienced considerable volatility. Current global solar PV production capacity exceeds anticipated near-term end-use demand, causing customers to significantly reduce or delay investments in manufacturing capacity and new technology, or to cease operations. In addition to the general industry changes described above in the third risk factor, the global solar market is characterized by ongoing changes specific to this industry that impact demand for and/or the profitability of Applied’s solar products, including:•the need to continually decrease the cost-per-watt of electricity produced by solar PV products to at or below grid parity in more global regions by, among other things, reducing operating costs and increasing throughputs for solar PV manufacturing, and improving the conversion efficiency of solar PVs;•the variability and uncertainty of government energy policies and their effect in influencing the rate of growth of the solar PV market, including the availability and amount of incentives for solar power such as tax credits, feed-in tariffs, rebates, renewable portfolio standards that require electricity providers to sell a targeted amount of energy from renewable sources, and goals for solar installations on government facilities;•the number of solar PV manufacturers and amount of global production capacity for solar PVs, primarily in China;•the filing of regulatory unfair trade proceedings against solar PVs from China, where most of Applied’s solar equipment sales are concentrated, which has resulted in the assessment of duties on solar cells and modules imported from China and led to other trade-related conflicts and outcomes;•the varying levels of operating and industry experience among solar PV manufacturers and the resulting differences in the nature and extent of customer support services requested from Applied;•challenges associated with marketing and selling manufacturing equipment and services to a diverse and diffuse customer base;•the growth of market segments in which Applied does not participate, such as passivation and furnaces;20Table of Contents•the increasing number of government-affiliated entities in China that are becoming customers;•the financial condition of solar PV customers and their access to affordable financing and capital; and•increasing solar industry challenges of solar panel manufacturing overcapacity and weaker operating performance and outlook, leading to the increasing deterioration of the solar equipment market and of the financial condition of Applied's customers.If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from the ongoing changes occurring in the solar industry, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the flat panel display industry.The global flat panel display industry historically has experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment investment levels, due in part to the limited number of LCD manufacturers, the concentrated nature of LCD end-use applications, and excess production capacity relative to end-use demand. Industry growth has depended primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced LCD TVs, which demand has slowed significantly, and more recently on demand for smartphones and other mobile devices, which demand is highly sensitive to cost and improvements in technologies and features. In addition to the general industry changes described above in the third risk factor, the display industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to that industry, including:•the timing and extent of a planned expansion of manufacturing facilities in China by Chinese display manufacturers and manufacturers from other countries, and the ability of non-Chinese manufacturers to obtain government approvals on a timely basis;•the slowing rate of transition to larger substrate sizes for LCD TVs and the resulting effect on capital intensity in the industry and on Applied’s product differentiation, gross margin and return on investment;•the increasing importance of new types of display technologies, such as low temperature polysilicon (LTPS), organic light-emitting diode (OLED) and metal oxide, and new touch panel films, such as anti-reflective and anti-fingerprint; and•uncertainty with respect to future LCD technology end-use applications and growth drivers.If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from the ongoing changes occurring in the display industry, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Applied must continually innovate, commercialize its products, and adapt its business and product offerings to respond to competition and rapid technological changes.As Applied operates in a highly competitive environment in which innovation is critical, its future success depends on many factors, including the effective commercialization and customer acceptance of its equipment, services and related products. In addition, Applied must successfully execute its growth strategy, including enhancing market share in existing markets, expanding into related markets, cultivating new markets and exceeding industry growth rates, while constantly improving its operational performance. The development, introduction and support of a broadening set of products in more collaborative, geographically diverse, open and varied competitive environments have grown increasingly complex and expensive over time. Furthermore, new or improved products may entail higher costs and reduced profits. Applied’s performance may be adversely affected if it does not timely, cost-effectively and successfully:•identify and address technology inflections, market changes, new applications, customer requirements and end-use demand;•develop new products (including disruptive technologies), improve and/or develop new applications for existing products, and adapt similar products for use by customers in different applications and/or markets with varying technical requirements;•differentiate its products from those of competitors and any disruptive technologies, meet customers’ performance specifications, appropriately price products, and achieve market acceptance;•maintain operating flexibility to enable different responses to different markets, customers and applications;•enhance its worldwide operations across all business segments to reduce cycle time, enable continuous quality improvement, reduce costs, and enhance design for manufacturability and serviceability;•focus on sales and marketing strategies that foster strong customer relationships;21Table of Contents•allocate resources, including people and R&D funding, among Applied’s products and between the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products, as most appropriate and effective for future growth;•reduce the cost and improve the productivity of capital invested in R&D activities;•accurately forecast demand, work with suppliers and meet production schedules for its products;•improve its manufacturing processes and achieve cost efficiencies across product offerings;•adapt to changes in value offered by companies in different parts of the supply chain;•qualify products for evaluation and, in turn, volume manufacturing with its customers; and•implement changes in its design engineering methodology, including those that enable reduction of material costs and cycle time, greater commonality of platforms and types of parts used in different systems, greater effectiveness of product life cycle management, and reduced energy usage and environmental impact.If Applied does not successfully manage these challenges, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base.Applied’s semiconductor customer base historically has been, and is becoming even more, highly concentrated as a result of economic and industry conditions. In fiscal 2012, three semiconductor manufacturers accounted for 60 percent of Silicon Systems Group net sales and two customers accounted for 36 percent of Applied’s consolidated net sales. Applied’s display customer base is also highly concentrated, while concentration within Applied’s solar customer base varies depending on the product line but is increasing due to challenging industry conditions. Applied’s customer base is also geographically-concentrated. In fiscal 2012, customers in Taiwan accounted for 32 percent of net sales for the Silicon Systems Group segment, while customers in Korea and the U.S. together constituted 49 percent; customers in Taiwan and China accounted for a total of 66 percent of net sales for the Display segment; and customers in China accounted for 49 percent of net sales for the Energy and Environmental Solutions segment.In addition, certain customers have experienced significant ownership or management changes, consolidated with other manufacturers, outsourced manufacturing activities, or engaged in collaboration or cooperation arrangements with other manufacturers. Customers have entered into strategic alliances or industry consortia that have increased the influence of key industry participants in technology decisions made by their partners. Also, certain customers are making an increasingly greater percentage of their respective industry’s capital equipment investments. Further, claims or litigation involving key industry participants may result in changes in sourcing strategies and other outcomes. In this environment, contracts or orders from a relatively limited number of manufacturers have accounted for, and are expected to continue to account for, a substantial portion of Applied’s business, which may result in added complexities in managing customer relationships and transactions and make it more challenging for Applied’s business units to generate organic growth. In addition, the mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. If customers do not place orders, or they substantially reduce, delay or cancel orders, Applied may not be able to replace the business. As Applied’s products are configured to customer specifications, changing, rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant, non-recoverable costs. Major customers may also seek, and on occasion receive, pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to Applied. These factors could have a material adverse effect on Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business.In fiscal 2012, approximately 80 percent of Applied’s net sales were to customers in regions outside the United States. Moreover, China now represents the largest market for various electronic products, such as TVs, PCs, and smartphones. Certain of Applied’s R&D and manufacturing facilities, as well as suppliers to Applied, are also located outside the United States, including in Singapore, Taiwan, China, Korea, Israel, Germany, Italy and Switzerland. Applied is also expanding its business and operations in new countries. The global nature of Applied’s business and operations, combined with the need to continually improve the Company’s operating cost structure, presents challenges, including but not limited to those arising from:•varying regional and geopolitical business conditions and demands;•political and social attitudes, laws, rules, regulations and policies within countries that favor domestic companies over non-domestic companies, including customer- or government-supported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors;•customer- or government-supported efforts to influence Applied to conduct more of its operations in a particular country, such as Korea and China;•variations among, and changes in, local, regional, national or international laws and regulations (including intellectual 22Table of Contentsproperty, labor, tax, and import/export laws), as well as the interpretation and application of such laws and regulations;•global trade issues, including those related to the interpretation and application of import and export licenses, as well as international trade disputes;•positions taken by governmental agencies regarding possible national commercial and/or security issues posed by international business operations;•fluctuating raw material, commodity, energy and shipping costs or shipping delays;•challenges associated with managing more geographically diverse operations and projects, which require an effective organizational structure and appropriate business processes, procedures and controls;•a more diverse workforce with different experience levels, cultures, customs, business practices and worker expectations;•variations in the ability to develop relationships with local customers, suppliers and governments;•fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates, including the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen, euro, Taiwanese dollar, Israeli shekel or Chinese yuan;•the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations around the world;•political instability, natural disasters (such as earthquakes, floods or storms), pandemics, social unrest, terrorism or acts of war in locations where Applied has operations, suppliers or sales, or that may influence the value chain of the industries that Applied serves;•the need for an effective business continuity plan if a disaster or other event occurs that could disrupt business operations;•reliance on various information systems, data centers and software applications to conduct many aspects of Applied's business, which may be vulnerable to cyberattacks by third parties or breached due to employee error, misuse or other causes that could result in business disruptions, misappropriation of confidential information, or other adverse consequences in the event that Applied’s firewalls and security processes and practices are ineffective;•the need to regularly reassess the size, capability and location of global infrastructure and make appropriate changes;•cultural and language differences;•difficulties and uncertainties associated with the entry into new countries;•hiring and integration of an increasing number of new workers, including in countries such as India and China;•the increasing need for the workforce to be more mobile and work in or travel to different regions;•uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various countries; and•uncertainties with respect to growth rates for the manufacture and sale of semiconductors, LCDs and solar PVs in the developing economies of certain countries.Many of these challenges are present in China and Korea, which are experiencing significant growth of customers, suppliers and competitors to Applied. Applied further believes that China and Korea present large potential markets for its products and opportunity for growth over the long term, although at lower projected levels of profitability and margins for certain products than historically have been achieved in other regions. These challenges may materially and adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Operating in multiple industries, and the entry into new markets and industries, entail additional challenges and obligations.As part of its growth strategy, Applied must successfully expand into related or new markets and industries, either with its existing products or with new products developed internally or obtained through acquisitions. The entry into different markets involves additional challenges, including those arising from:•the need to devote additional resources to develop new products for, and operate in, new markets;•the need to develop new sales and technical marketing strategies, cultivate relationships with new customers and meet different customer service requirements;•differing rates of profitability and growth among multiple businesses;•Applied’s ability to anticipate demand, capitalize on opportunities, and avoid or minimize risks;•the complexity of managing multiple businesses with variations in production planning, execution, supply chain management and logistics;•the adoption of new business models, business processes and systems;23Table of Contents•Applied’s ability to rapidly expand or reduce its operations to meet increased or decreased demand, respectively, and the associated effect on working capital;•new materials, processes and technologies;•the need to attract, motivate and retain employees with skills and expertise in these new areas;•new and more diverse customers and suppliers, including some with limited operating histories, uncertain and/or limited funding, evolving business models and/or locations in regions where Applied does not have, or has limited, operations;•new or different competitors with potentially more financial or other resources, industry experience and/or established customer relationships;•entry into new industries and countries, with differing levels of government involvement, laws and regulations, and business, employment and safety practices;•third parties’ intellectual property rights; and•the need to comply with, or work to establish, industry standards and practices.In addition, Applied from time to time receives funding from United States and other government agencies for certain strategic development programs to increase its research and development resources and address new market opportunities. As a condition to this government funding, Applied may be subject to certain record-keeping, audit, intellectual property rights-sharing and/or other obligations.If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from its diversification and entry into new markets and industries, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect Applied’s ability to meet customer demand and lead to higher costs, while the failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory.Applied’s business depends on its timely supply of equipment, services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of its customers, which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts, components and subassemblies (collectively, parts) from suppliers, including contract manufacturers. Some key parts are subject to long lead-times and/or obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers, and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the countries where Applied conducts its manufacturing, including China and Korea. Cyclical industry conditions and the volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase capital, technical, operational and other risks for Applied and for companies throughout its supply chain. Further, the adverse conditions in the credit and financial markets and industry slowdowns have caused, and may continue to cause, some suppliers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other companies, or file for bankruptcy protection and possibly cease operations. Applied may also experience significant interruptions of its manufacturing operations, delays in its ability to deliver products or services, increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of:•the failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver sufficient quantities of quality parts on a cost-effective basis;•volatility in the availability and cost of materials, including rare earth elements;•difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals;•information technology or infrastructure failures; and•natural disasters or other events beyond Applied's control (such as earthquakes, floods or storms, regional economic downturns, pandemics, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war), particularly where it conducts manufacturing (such as Israel, which has recently experienced increased geopolitical conflict).If a supplier fails to meet Applied’s requirements concerning quality, cost, socially-responsible business practices, or other performance factors, Applied may transfer its business to alternative sources, which could entail manufacturing delays, additional costs, or other difficulties. In addition, if Applied needs to rapidly increase its business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules, this may exacerbate any interruptions in Applied’s manufacturing operations and supply chain and the associated effect on Applied’s working capital. Moreover, if actual demand for Applied’s products is different than expected, Applied may purchase more/fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or expediting delivery of parts. If Applied purchases inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize, or if customers reduce or delay orders, Applied may incur excess inventory charges. Any or all of these factors could materially and adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations.24Table of ContentsThe ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital to Applied’s success.Applied’s success, competitiveness and ability to execute on its global strategies and maintain a culture of innovation depend in large part on its ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees, especially in critical positions. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, management changes, Applied’s organizational structure, competitors’ hiring practices, cost reduction activities (including workforce reductions and unpaid shutdowns), availability of career development opportunities, the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries, and the effectiveness of Applied’s compensation and benefit programs, including its share-based programs. Restructuring programs present particular challenges to the extent they involve the departure of knowledgeable and experienced employees and the resulting need to identify and train existing or new workers to perform necessary functions, which may result in unexpected costs, reduced productivity, and/or difficulties with respect to internal processes and controls.  If Applied does not successfully attract, retain and motivate key employees with appropriate skills, Applied may be unable to capitalize on its opportunities and its business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.Applied is exposed to risks associated with acquisitions and strategic investments.Applied has made, and in the future intends to make, acquisitions of or investments in companies, technologies or products in existing, related or new markets for Applied. In November 2011, Applied completed its acquisition of Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. (Varian), which was the Company’s largest acquisition to date. Acquisitions involve numerous risks that vary depending on the scale and nature of the acquisition, including but not limited to:•diversion of management’s attention from other operational matters;•inability to complete acquisitions as anticipated or at all;•the appropriateness of valuation and other transaction terms;•requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures and/or restrictions on the conduct of Applied’s existing business or the acquired business;•ineffective integration of operations, systems, technologies, products or employees of an acquired business, which can impact the ability to realize anticipated synergies or other benefits;•failure to commercialize purchased technologies;•initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners;•inability to capitalize on characteristics of new markets that may be significantly different from Applied’s existing markets and where competitors may have stronger market positions and customer relationships;•failure to attract, retain and motivate key employees from the acquired business;•reductions in cash balances and/or increases in debt obligations to finance the acquisition, which reduce the availability of cash flow for general corporate or other purposes;•exposure to new operational risks, rules, regulations, worker expectations, customs and practices to the extent acquired businesses are located in regions where Applied has not historically conducted business;•challenges associated with managing new, more diverse and more widespread operations, projects and people;•inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in key technologies;•inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company’s internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and/or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices;•impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the segment;25Table of Contents•the risk of litigation or claims associated with a proposed or completed transaction;•unknown, underestimated and/or undisclosed commitments or liabilities; and•the inappropriate scale of acquired entities’ critical resources or facilities for business needs.Applied also makes strategic investments in other companies, including companies formed as joint ventures, which may decline in value and/or not meet desired objectives. The success of these investments depends on various factors over which Applied may have limited or no control and, particularly with respect to joint ventures, requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic partners. The risks to Applied’s strategic investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions and, as a result, the value of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges. Mergers and acquisitions and strategic investments are inherently subject to significant risks. If Applied does not successfully manage the risks associated with acquisitions and strategic investments, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Applied is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims and protection of intellectual property rights.Applied from time to time is, and in the future may be, involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement, intellectual property rights, antitrust, environmental regulations, securities, contracts, product performance, product liability, unfair competition, misappropriation of trade secrets, employment, workplace safety, and other matters. Applied also on occasion receives notification from customers who believe that Applied owes them indemnification or other obligations related to claims made against such customers by third parties.In February 2010, the Seoul Prosecutor’s Office for the Eastern District in Korea indicted certain employees of Applied Materials Korea (AMK), including the former head of AMK who at the time of indictment was a vice president of Applied Materials, Inc., along with employees of several other companies, alleging the improper receipt and use of confidential information of Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (Samsung), a major customer. Hearings on these matters have been ongoing. On November 22, 2012, the Court held the last hearing and scheduled the announcement of its decision for January 24, 2013.Legal proceedings and claims, whether with or without merit, and associated internal investigations, may (1) be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct; (2) divert management’s attention and other Applied resources; (3) inhibit Applied’s ability to sell its products; (4) result in adverse judgments for damages, injunctive relief, penalties and fines; and/or (5) negatively affect Applied’s business. There can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings, claims or investigations. If Applied is not able to favorably resolve or settle legal proceedings or claims, or in the event of any adverse findings against Applied or any of its employees, Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and Applied may suffer harm to its reputation.In addition, Applied’s success depends in significant part on the protection of its intellectual property and other rights. Infringement of Applied’s rights by a third party, such as the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts, could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for Applied. Applied’s intellectual property rights may not provide significant competitive advantages if they are circumvented, invalidated, rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, or if Applied does not adequately protect or assert these rights. Furthermore, the laws and practices of other countries, including China, India, Taiwan and Korea, permit the protection and enforcement of Applied’s rights to varying extents, which may not be sufficient to adequately protect Applied’s rights. Applied previously entered into an arrangement with one of its competitors to decrease the risk of patent infringement lawsuits in the future. There can be no assurance that the intended results of this arrangement will be achieved or that Applied will be able to adequately protect its intellectual property rights with the restrictions associated with the arrangement. If Applied is not able to favorably resolve or settle claims, obtain or enforce intellectual property rights, obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, and/or successfully prosecute or defend its intellectual property position, Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and Applied may suffer harm to its reputation.26Table of ContentsThe failure to successfully implement and conduct outsourcing activities and other operational initiatives could adversely affect results of operations.To better align its costs with market conditions, locate closer to customers, enhance productivity, and improve efficiencies, Applied conducts certain engineering, software development, manufacturing, sourcing and other operations in regions outside the United States, including India, Taiwan, China, and Korea. Applied has implemented a distributed manufacturing model, under which certain manufacturing and supply chain activities are conducted in various countries, including the United States, Europe, Israel, Singapore, Taiwan and other countries in Asia, and assembly of some systems is completed at customer sites. In addition, Applied outsources certain functions to third parties, including companies in the United States, India, China, Korea, Malaysia and other countries. Outsourced functions include contract manufacturing, engineering, customer support, software development, information technology support, finance and administrative activities. The expanding role of third party providers has required changes to Applied’s existing operations and the adoption of new procedures and processes for retaining and managing these providers, as well as redistributing responsibilities as warranted, in order to realize the potential productivity and operational efficiencies, assure quality and continuity of supply, and protect the intellectual property of Applied and its customers, suppliers and other partners. If Applied does not accurately forecast the amount, timing and mix of demand for products, or if contract manufacturers or other outsource providers fail to perform in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, Applied’s ability to meet customer requirements could suffer, particularly during a market upturn.In addition, Applied must regularly implement or update comprehensive programs and processes to better align its global organizations, including initiatives to enhance the Asia supply chain and improve back office and information technology infrastructure for more efficient transaction processing. Applied also is implementing a multi-year, company-wide program to transform certain business processes or extend established processes, including the transition to a single enterprise resource planning (ERP) software system to perform various functions. The implementation of additional functionality to the ERP system entails certain risks, including difficulties with changes in business processes that could disrupt Applied’s operations, such as its ability to track orders and timely ship products, project inventory requirements, manage its supply chain and aggregate financial and operational data. During transitions Applied must continue to rely on legacy information systems, which may be costly or inefficient, while the implementation of new initiatives may not achieve the anticipated benefits and may divert management’s attention from other operational activities, negatively affect employee morale, or have other unintended consequences.If Applied does not effectively develop and implement its outsourcing and relocation strategies, if required export and other governmental approvals are not timely obtained, if Applied’s third party providers do not perform as anticipated, or if there are delays or difficulties in enhancing business processes, Applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies, and may experience operational difficulties, increased costs (including energy and transportation), manufacturing interruptions or delays, inefficiencies in the structure and/or operation of its supply chain, loss of its intellectual property rights, quality issues, reputational harm, increased product time-to-market, and/or inefficient allocation of human resources, any or all of which could materially and adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Applied may incur impairment charges to goodwill or long-lived assets.Applied has a significant amount of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions. Goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The review compares the fair value for each of Applied’s reporting units to its associated carrying value, including goodwill. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, declines in the market price of Applied common stock, changes in Applied’s strategies or product portfolio, and restructuring activities. Applied’s valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance. For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, Applied concluded that the carrying value of the Energy and Environmental Solutions reporting unit exceeded its fair value and accordingly recorded a $421 million goodwill impairment charge. Applied may be required to record future charges to earnings during the period in which an impairment of goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined to exist, which could materially and adversely affect Applied’s results of operations.27Table of ContentsChanges in tax rates or tax assets and liabilities could affect results of operations.As a global company, Applied is subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries. Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities. Applied’s future annual and quarterly tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the: (1) applicable tax laws; (2) amount and composition of pre-tax income in countries with differing tax rates; (3) plans of the Company to permanently reinvest certain funds held outside of the U.S.; or (4) valuation of Applied’s deferred tax assets and liabilities.To better align with the increasingly international nature of its business, Applied is transitioning certain manufacturing, supply chain, and other operations into Asia, bringing these activities closer to customers. These changes are expected to result in a reduction of future operating costs. Applied has received authorization to use tax incentives that provide that income earned in certain countries outside the U.S. will be subject to tax holidays or reduced income tax rates. To obtain the benefit of these tax provisions, Applied must meet requirements relating to various activities. Applied’s ability to realize benefits from these provisions could be materially affected if, among other things, applicable requirements are not met, or if Applied incurs net losses for which it cannot claim a deduction.In addition, Applied is subject to regular examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and from time to time initiates amendments to previously filed tax returns. Applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes, which requires estimates and judgments. Although Applied believes its tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the tax authorities will agree with such estimates. Applied may have to engage in litigation to achieve the results reflected in the estimates, which may be time-consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance that Applied will be successful or that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in Applied’s historical income tax provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect Applied’s financial condition and results of operations.Applied is subject to risks of non-compliance with environmental and safety regulations.Applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in connection with its global business operations, including but not limited to: regulations related to the development, manufacture and use of its products; recycling and disposal of materials used in its products or in producing its products; the operation of its facilities; and the use of its real property. The failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental and safety regulations, such as those related to climate change, could result in: (1) significant remediation liabilities; (2) the imposition of fines; (3) the suspension or termination of the development, manufacture, sale or use of certain of its products; (4) limitations on the operation of its facilities or ability to use its real property; and/or (5) a decrease in the value of its real property, each of which could have a material adverse effect on Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Applied is exposed to various risks related to the regulatory environment.Applied is subject to various risks related to: (1) new, different, inconsistent or even conflicting laws, rules and regulations that may be enacted by executive order, legislative bodies and/or regulatory agencies in the countries in which Applied operates; (2) disagreements or disputes between national or regional regulatory agencies related to international trade; and (3) the interpretation and application of laws, rules and regulations. For example, as a public company with global operations, Applied is subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, including those related to financial and other disclosures, corporate governance, privacy, and anti-corruption. Changes in laws, regulations and standards may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters. Efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If Applied is found by a court or regulatory agency not to be in compliance with applicable laws, rules or regulations, Applied could be subject to legal or regulatory sanctions, the public’s and customers’ perception of Applied could decline, and Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
