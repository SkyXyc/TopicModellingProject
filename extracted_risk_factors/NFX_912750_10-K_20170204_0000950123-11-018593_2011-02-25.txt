    Overview


 


    We are a Delaware corporation and were founded in 1989. Our
    company began as a Gulf of Mexico focused company. Over the last
    decade, we have diversified our asset base and added multiple
    areas capable of sustainable growth. Our asset base and related
    capital programs are diversified both geographically and by
    type — onshore and offshore, domestic and
    international, and conventional plays and unconventional
    “resource” plays in both oil and gas basins.
    Approximately 82% of our proved reserves and 90% of our probable
    reserves at year-end 2010 were located in resource plays,
    primarily in the Mid-Continent and the Rocky Mountains.
    Approximately 60% of our 2010 capital investments were allocated
    to growth opportunities in these regions. We expect our 2011
    investment levels in these areas to be similar.


 


    At year-end 2010, we had proved reserves of 3.7 Tcfe, a 3%
    increase over proved reserves at year-end 2009. At the end of
    2010, our proved reserves were 67% natural gas and 58% proved
    developed. Our probable reserves were 74% natural gas. As a
    result of our focus on resource plays, our year-end 2010 proved
    reserve life index was approximately 13 years. Our 2010
    production was 288 Bcfe.

    Strategy


 


    Our growth strategy has evolved since our company was founded in
    1989 and has allowed us to move into new unconventional plays,
    lengthen our reserves life and build a diverse portfolio capable
    of sustainable future growth. Our strategy today consists of the
    following key elements:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    focusing on unconventional, domestic resource plays of scale,
    characterized by large acreage positions and deep inventories of
    low risk drilling opportunities;




 



     
        • 

    
    growing reserves through an active drilling program,
    supplemented with select acquisitions;




 



     
        • 

    
    focusing on select geographic areas and allocating capital to
    the best growth opportunities;




 



     
        • 

    
    controlling operations and costs; and




 



     
        • 

    
    attracting and retaining a quality workforce through equity
    ownership and other performance-based incentives.





 


    Focus on Unconventional Resource Plays of
    Scale.  Over the last several years, our
    industry has increased its focus on unconventional resources.
    These plays cover large acreage positions and have years of
    lower-risk drilling opportunities. Their development allows for
    efficiency gains in the drilling and completion





    
    2

    processes, as well as sustainable and repeatable growth
    profiles. Our unconventional resource plays include producing
    positions in the Woodford Shale of Oklahoma, the Granite Wash of
    Texas and Oklahoma, the Uinta Basin of Utah and the Eagle Ford
    and Pearsall shales of southwest Texas. We also have acreage in
    the Marcellus Shale of Pennsylvania and the Southern Alberta
    Basin of Montana.


 


    Drilling Program.  The components of our
    drilling program reflect the significant changes in our asset
    base over the last few years. To manage the risks associated
    with our strategy to grow reserves through our drilling
    programs, a substantial majority of the wells we drilled in 2010
    were lower-risk with low to moderate reserve potential. We have
    lower-risk drilling opportunities in the Mid-Continent, the
    Rocky Mountains and the shallow waters of Malaysia. In addition,
    we have assessment drilling in areas like the Eagle Ford and
    Pearsall shales and the Southern Alberta Basin. These
    opportunities are complemented with higher-risk, higher reserve
    potential exploration plays in the deepwater of the Gulf of
    Mexico and international. We actively look for new drilling
    ideas on our existing property base and on properties that may
    be acquired.


 


    Acquisitions.  Acquisitions have
    consistently been a part of our strategy, particularly when
    entering new geographic regions. Since 2000, we have completed
    five significant acquisitions that led to the establishment of
    new focus areas onshore in the United States. We actively pursue
    acquisitions of proved oil and gas properties in select
    geographic areas, including those areas where we currently
    focus. The potential to add reserves through drilling is a
    critical consideration in our acquisition screening process.


 


    Geographic Focus.  We believe that our
    long-term success requires extensive knowledge of the geologic
    and operating conditions in the areas where we operate. Because
    of this belief, we focus our efforts on a limited number of
    geographic areas where we can use our core competencies and have
    a significant influence on operations. Geographic focus also
    allows more efficient use of capital and personnel.


 


    Control of Operations and Costs.  In
    general, we prefer to operate our properties. By controlling
    operations, we can better manage production performance, control
    operating expenses and capital expenditures, consider the
    application of technologies and influence timing. At year-end
    2010, we operated a significant portion of our net total
    production.


 


    Equity Ownership and Incentive
    Compensation.  We want our employees to act
    like owners, so we reward and encourage them through equity
    ownership and performance-based compensation. A large portion of
    our employees’ compensation is tied to our performance.


 




    2011
    Outlook and Capital Investments


 


    Our 2011 capital budget is $1.7 billion, excluding
    $170 million of capitalized interest and overhead.
    Approximately two-thirds of our capital investments will be
    allocated to oil projects and substantially all of the remainder
    is planned for “liquids rich” gas plays. We expect our
    2011 production to grow
    8-12% over
    2010 levels. Domestic oil production is expected to increase
    about 50% in 2011. Natural gas production is expected to remain
    relatively flat in 2011, despite a significant reduction in
    natural gas investments. Our diversified portfolio of assets
    provides us with flexibility in our capital allocation process.
    We have the operational flexibility to react quickly with our
    capital expenditures to changes in our cash flows from
    operations or to commodity price volatility.


 


    Our estimated 2011 capital investments by area are shown in the
    chart below:

    Our
    Properties and Plans for 2011


 



    Resource
    Plays


 


    A key element of our strategy is to focus on domestic,
    unconventional resource plays of scale. These plays represent
    approximately 82% of our proved reserves and 90% of our probable
    reserves at year-end 2010.


 


    Mid-Continent.  Our largest division in
    terms of our recent production, reserves and capital investment
    is the Mid-Continent. We are focused primarily in the Anadarko
    and Arkoma basins. In 2010, activity began to slow due to our
    shift from natural gas directed drilling to oil directed
    drilling throughout the Company. As of December 31, 2010,
    we owned a working interest in approximately 755,000 gross
    acres (approximately 410,000 net acres) and approximately
    2,900 gross producing wells.


 


    Woodford Shale.  Our largest single investment
    area over the last several years has been the Woodford Shale,
    located in the Arkoma Basin of southeast Oklahoma. The Woodford
    is primarily a dry gas shale formation that varies in thickness
    from 100 to 200 feet throughout our acreage. Our activity
    levels in the natural gas portion of the Woodford were reduced
    in 2010. We entered 2010 with eight rigs running and exited the
    year with three rigs. At year-end 2010, we owned an interest in
    approximately 172,000 net acres. Our average working
    interest is approximately 60%. Since entering the play in 2003,
    we have drilled more than 100 vertical wells and approximately
    350 horizontal wells. In 2010, we assessed a new
    “oily” play in the Woodford, located primarily on the
    western edge of our acreage. We plan to drill additional wells
    in this play during 2011. In total, we plan to run two to three
    rigs in the Woodford during 2011.


 


    Our 2010 production in the Woodford Shale was 25% higher than
    our 2009 production and as of December 31, 2010, our
    operated production was 169 MMcfe/d net.


 


    We expect our natural gas production in the Woodford Shale to
    decline slightly in 2011 due to reduced capital investment in
    both our operated and non-operated drilling programs.
    Substantially all of our acreage is
    held-by-production.
    Our development plans for the field include drilling several
    thousand wells on primarily
    40-acre
    spacing. In 2010, we continued to advance and improve this play
    through the drilling of longer lateral wells, repeatable
    drilling efficiency gains and optimization of completions. Our
    average lateral length increased by 25% in 2010 to approximately
    6,300 feet which included several wells in excess of
    10,000 feet. In 2011, we expect our average lateral length
    to be approximately 8,000 feet.


 


    Granite Wash.  We are active in the Granite
    Wash play located in the Anadarko Basin of northern Texas and
    western Oklahoma and have more than 48,000 net acres in the
    play. Our largest producing field in the Granite Wash is
    Stiles/Britt Ranch, where we operate and own an average 75%
    working interest. Although we have approximately 150 producing
    vertical wells in Stiles/Britt Ranch, our drilling program is
    now dedicated to horizontal drilling. Since late 2008, we have
    drilled and completed 35 horizontal wells in the Granite Wash
    and the average initial production for these wells was
    approximately 16 MMcfe/d gross. During 2010, we ran three
    to four operated drilling rigs in the field with total daily
    production as of December 31, 2010 of approximately
    86 MMcfe/d net. We expect to continue this level of
    activity in the Granite Wash, and expect our production to grow
    nearly 20% in 2011. We have an inventory of approximately
    300 potential drilling locations in the Granite Wash.


 


    Rocky Mountains.  As of
    December 31, 2010, we owned an interest in approximately
    1.2 million gross acres (850,000 net acres) and more
    than 2,000 gross producing wells. Our assets are primarily
    oil and characterized by long-lived production. Our efforts
    today are focused primarily in the Uinta, Williston and Southern
    Alberta basins.


 


    Greater Monument Butte.  Our largest asset in
    the Rocky Mountains is the Greater Monument Butte field area,
    located in the Uinta Basin of Utah. Our working interest in the
    region averages about 71%. We have approximately 1,200
    productive oil wells in the Monument Butte Unit. Our acreage in
    this region is approximately 183,000 net acres. This
    includes over 60,000 net acres that we have added in recent
    years on Tribal and fee acreage north and adjacent to the
    Monument Butte Unit. Since 2008, we have drilled over
    300 wells on the Tribal and fee acreage. Our gross
    production from the Greater Monument Butte field area has grown
    from 7,000 BOPD in 2004 to a 2010 exit rate of approximately
    22,000 BOPD. In 2011, we are





    
    4



Table of Contents





    planning to continue drilling a substantial portion of the
    acreage on
    20-acre
    development spacing and estimate that we have thousands of
    remaining locations in the Greater Monument Butte field area.


 


    There is a significant gas resource beneath the shallow
    producing oil zones at Monument Butte. In 2008, we participated
    in the drilling of six successful deep test wells to evaluate
    these deeper formations.


 


    Williston Basin/Southern Alberta Basin.  We
    have approximately 120,000 net acres in the Williston
    Basin, excluding approximately 54,000 net acres in the
    mature Elm Coulee field. To date, we have drilled
    44 successful wells with production from the Bakken and
    Sanish/Three Forks formations. In late 2010, we released
    information on two super extended 9,000 foot lateral wells
    (SXLs) west of the Nesson Anticline with 24 hour initial
    production rates averaging more than 3,300 BOEPD gross. In 2011,
    virtually all of our wells within our Williston Basin drilling
    program are expected to be SXL wells. Our production at year-end
    2010 was approximately 7,000 BOEPD net. We plan to run four to
    six operated rigs in the Williston Basin in 2011. In late 2009,
    we reached an agreement with the Blackfeet Nation covering
    approximately 156,000 net acres in the Southern Alberta
    Basin of northern Montana. Including this transaction, we now
    have approximately 280,000 net acres in the Southern
    Alberta Basin. In 2010, we drilled five vertical wells and one
    horizontal well and assessment continues in 2011.


 


    Green River Basin.  We own interests and
    operate our activities on approximately 3,000 net acres in
    the Pinedale field, located in Sublette County, Wyoming. We also
    have an interest in the Jonah field, located in Sublette County,
    Wyoming. Although we halted our activities in the Green River
    Basin in 2009 due to lower gas prices, we see the potential to
    drill additional locations as gas prices improve in the future.


 


    Onshore Texas.  We have approximately
    335,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford and Pearsall shales in
    the Maverick Basin, located in Maverick, Dimmit and Zavala
    counties, Texas. The acreage is prospective for multiple
    geologic horizons. Our initial assessment program in 2010
    included 11 Eagle Ford Shale wells with lateral lengths of
    approximately 5,000 feet. The wells encountered light oil
    with API gravities ranging from 30 to 50 degrees. We now believe
    that substantially all of our Eagle Ford acreage in the Maverick
    Basin is within the oil window.


 


    Appalachia.  In mid-2009, we signed a
    joint exploration agreement with Hess Corporation covering
    acreage primarily in Wayne County, Pennsylvania. We are the
    operator of this venture with a 50% working interest. At
    year-end 2010, we had leased about 35,000 net acres. This
    marked our entry into the Marcellus — one of the
    nation’s largest resource plays. The Marcellus is
    economically advantaged due to its close proximity to the gas
    markets in the northeast. To date, we have drilled three
    vertical geologic test wells and are currently evaluating the
    data. These wells have not been completed. We remain interested
    in the Appalachia region and continue to look for attractive
    opportunities to increase our ownership in the trend.


 



    Conventional
    Plays


 


    We also have operations in conventional plays onshore Texas, in
    the Gulf of Mexico and offshore Malaysia and China.


 


    Onshore Texas.  As of December 31,
    2010, we owned an interest in approximately 307,000 gross
    acres (195,000 net) and about 640 gross producing wells
    onshore Texas. In 2010, we slowed our activities in many of our
    conventional natural gas plays in response to lower natural gas
    prices. At year-end 2010, we were producing approximately
    125 MMcfe/d net from our conventional onshore Texas assets.
    With planned decreased investments in 2011 and natural field
    declines, we expect production from this area to decline
    approximately 20% during 2011. In late 2010, we began a process
    to monetize certain non-strategic assets primarily from our
    onshore Texas region.


 


    Gulf of Mexico.  Our Gulf of Mexico
    operations are focused on the deepwater. At year-end 2010, our
    production from the Gulf of Mexico was approximately
    95 MMcfe/d net. In addition to our producing fields, we
    have three developments underway. As of December 31, 2010,
    we owned interests in 84 deepwater leases and approximately
    350,000 net acres. We have an inventory of prospects
    acquired primarily through federal lease sales. Our working
    interests typically range from 20 to 50%. Following the 2010
    Macondo incident in the Gulf of Mexico, we elected to defer our
    2011 exploratory plans in the deepwater Gulf. With two deepwater
    developments





    
    5



Table of Contents





    commencing production in 2011, we expect our Gulf of Mexico
    production to grow approximately 8% compared to 2010.


 


    International.  Our international
    activities are focused in Southeast Asia. We have production and
    active developments offshore Malaysia and China. Our
    international production at year-end 2010 was approximately
    19,000 BOPD net. We have an interest in approximately
    2.5 million gross acres (936,000 net) offshore Malaysia and
    approximately 404,000 gross acres (385,000 net) offshore
    China. In 2011, our plans include continued development of our
    oil fields offshore Malaysia. During 2011, we also plan to
    develop our “Pearl” discovery (initial production
    2013) in the Pearl River Mouth Basin of China and drill up
    to two exploratory wells offshore China. We expect our
    international production to grow moderately in 2011.

    Estimated
    Reserves


 


    All reserve information in this report is based on estimates
    prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and is the
    responsibility of management. The preparation of our oil and gas
    reserves estimates is completed in accordance with our
    prescribed internal control procedures, which include
    verification of data input into reserves forecasting and
    economics evaluation software, as well as multi-discipline
    management reviews, as described below. The technical employee
    responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserves
    estimates has a Bachelor of Science in Petroleum Engineering,
    with more than 25 years of experience (including
    15 years of experience in reserve estimation) and is a
    Registered Professional Engineer in Texas.


 


    Our reserves estimates are made using available geological and
    reservoir data as well as production performance data. These
    estimates, made by our petroleum engineering staff, are reviewed
    annually with management and revised, either upward or downward,
    as warranted by additional data. The data reviewed includes,
    among other things, seismic data, well logs, production tests,
    reservoir pressures, individual well and field performance data.
    The data incorporated into our interpretations includes
    structure and isopach maps, individual well and field
    performance and other engineering and geological work products
    such as material balance calculations and reservoir simulation
    to arrive at conclusions about individual well and field
    projections. Additionally, offset performance data, operating
    expenses, capital costs and product prices factor into
    estimating quantities of reserves. Revisions are necessary due
    to changes in, among other things, reservoir performance,
    prices, economic conditions and governmental regulations, as
    well as changes in the expected recovery rates associated with
    infill drilling. Sustained decreases in prices, for example, may
    cause a reduction in some reserves due to reaching economic
    limits sooner.


 


    Actual quantities of reserves recovered will most likely vary
    from the estimates set forth below. Reserves and cash flow
    estimates rely on interpretations of data and require
    assumptions that may be inaccurate. For a discussion of these
    interpretations and assumptions, see “Actual quantities
    of oil and gas reserves and future cash flows from those
    reserves will most likely vary from our estimates”
    under Item 1A of this report. Our estimates of proved
    reserves, proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped
    reserves and future net cash flows and discounted future net
    cash flows from proved reserves at December 31, 2010, 2009
    and 2008 and changes in proved reserves during the last three
    years are contained in “Supplementary Financial
    Information — Supplementary Oil and Gas
    Disclosures — Estimated Net Quantities of Proved Oil
    and Gas Reserves” in Item 8 of this report. For a
    discussion of the significant changes in our proved reserves
    during 2010, please see the information set forth in
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Proved
    Reserves” in Item 7 of this report.

    Proved Reserves.  Our year-end 2010
    proved reserves of 3,712 Bcfe increased 3% compared to our
    proved reserves at year-end 2009. Our reserves consisted of
    1,783 Bcfe proved developed producing, 381 Bcfe proved
    developed non-producing and 1,548 Bcfe proved undeveloped
    reserves.


 


    At December 31, 2009, our estimated proved undeveloped
    reserves were 1,708 Bcfe. During 2010, we spent
    $550 million of drilling, completion and facilities-related
    capital to convert 262 Bcfe of our December 31, 2009
    proved undeveloped reserves into proved developed reserves.
    During 2010, we added 414 Bcfe of new proved undeveloped
    reserves through drilling activities. Proved undeveloped reserve
    quantities were limited by the activity level of development
    drilling we expect to undertake during the
    2011-2015
    five-year period. Due to the higher margins of oil over natural
    gas investments, we shifted significant capital toward oil
    projects in our portfolio. As a result of this shift, we
    reclassified approximately 315 Bcfe of proved undeveloped
    reserves (nearly all Mid-Continent natural gas reserves) to
    probable reserves because the slower pace of development
    activity placed them beyond the five-year development horizon.
    Quantities of reserves that would otherwise meet the definition
    of proved undeveloped reserves, except for the fact that they
    will be developed beyond the
    2011-2015
    five-year horizon (1,336 Bcfe), were classified as probable
    reserves, in accordance with SEC regulations. As a result of the
    foregoing and minor performance related revisions, our proved
    undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2010 were
    1,548 Bcfe, 99.6% of which have been included in our
    reserve report for less than five years. For additional
    information regarding the changes in our proved reserves, see
    “Proved Reserves” under Item 7 of this report.


 


    In the years
    2008-2010,
    we developed 17%, 11% and 13%, respectively, of our prior
    year-end proved undeveloped reserves. The development plans in
    our year-end reserve report reflect (i) the allocation of
    capital to projects in the first year of activity based upon the
    initial budget for such year and (ii) in subsequent years,
    the capital allocation in our five-year business plan, each of
    which generally is governed by our expectations for capital
    investment in such time period. Changes in commodity pricing
    between the time of preparation of the reserve report and actual
    investment, investment alternatives that may have been added to
    our portfolio of assets, changes in the availability and costs
    of oilfield services, and other economic factors may lead to
    changes in our development plans. As a result, the future rate
    at which we develop our proved undeveloped reserves may vary
    from historical development rates.


 


    Probable Reserves.  Our total estimated
    probable reserves of 2,473 Bcfe at December 31, 2010,
    consisted of 34 Bcfe of developed and 2,439 Bcfe of
    undeveloped reserves, as compared to probable developed and
    undeveloped reserves at year-end 2009 of 101 Bcfe and
    1,792 Bcfe, respectively.


 


    At December 31, 2009, our estimated probable reserves were
    1,893 Bcfe. During 2010, we converted 315 Bcfe of our
    December 31, 2009 probable reserves into proved developed
    reserves. Also during 2010, we added probable reserves of
    1,025 Bcfe, which included 706 Bcfe of additions from
    our exploration and development activities and the
    reclassification of 315 Bcfe from proved undeveloped
    reserves (nearly all Mid-Continent natural gas reserves) to
    probable undeveloped reserves. Performance related revisions of
    previous estimates reduced probable reserves by 147 Bcfe at
    December 31, 2010. As a result of the foregoing and minor
    pricing related revisions, our probable reserves at
    December 31, 2010 were 2,473 Bcfe.


 


    Probable undeveloped reserves of 2,439 Bcfe at year-end
    2010 include 1,336 Bcfe that would otherwise meet the
    definition of proved undeveloped reserves, except that they will
    not be developed during the
    2011-2015
    five-year horizon. The characteristic uncertainties associated
    with the remaining 1,103 Bcfe of undeveloped probable
    reserves vary significantly between our major operating areas.
    These uncertainties restrain this reserve classification from
    becoming proved reserves due to their cumulative effect on
    achieving the reasonable certainty threshold required for proved
    reserves. These additional uncertainties include the lack of
    3-D seismic
    control, uncertainty associated with geologic and reservoir
    continuity with increasing distance away from a producing well,
    immature portions of an existing waterflood, secondary response
    in areas of a field that has exhibited lower primary waterflood
    recoveries, incremental recovery factors and field development
    timing associated with regulatory
    and/or
    governmental approval.

    Reserves Sensitivities.  To determine
    our year-end 2010 reserves estimates, we utilized the unweighted
    average
    first-day-of-the-month
    natural gas and crude oil prices for the prior twelve months,
    which was $4.38 per MMBtu and $79.42 per barrel, respectively,
    adjusted for market differentials.


 


    The quantity of our proved reserves decreases slightly at lower
    crude oil prices as a result of shortening the economic life of
    our proved developed reserves. Our development plans would not
    materially change across a range of crude oil prices between $60
    and $90 per barrel and, therefore, have little impact on the
    quantity of proved undeveloped reserves. That quantity is
    limited by the level of development drilling we expect to
    undertake during the
    2011-2015
    five-year period. Our proved undeveloped oil reserves are
    primarily in our Monument Butte field.


 


    The quantity of our probable reserves changes less than 1%
    between a $4.00 and $5.00 per MMBtu natural gas price with no
    change in oil price. Using a $60 to $70 per barrel oil price
    range, with no change in natural gas price, the quantity of our
    probable reserves is relatively unchanged. Our probable reserves
    increase slightly at higher oil prices.


 


    Under the terms of our production sharing contracts in Malaysia
    and China, an increase or decrease in realized oil prices would
    result in a decrease or increase, respectively, in our proved
    reserves. At higher oil prices, lesser quantities of oil are
    required for cost recovery and at lower oil prices, greater
    quantities of oil are required for cost recovery. Our share (the
    contractor’s share) of future production is impacted
    accordingly. The effect of higher or lower oil prices may be
    partially offset by extending or shortening, respectively, the
    economic life of proved reserves.

    The
    day-to-day
    operations of oil and gas properties are the responsibility of
    an operator designated under pooling or operating agreements or
    production sharing contracts. The operator supervises
    production, maintains production records, employs or contracts
    for field personnel and performs other functions. Generally, an
    operator receives reimbursement for direct expenses incurred in
    the performance of its duties as well as monthly per-well
    producing and drilling overhead reimbursement at rates
    customarily charged by unaffiliated third parties. The charges
    customarily vary with the depth and location of the well being
    operated.

    Acreage
    Data


 


    As of December 31, 2010, we owned interests in developed
    and undeveloped oil and gas acreage set forth in the table
    below. Domestic ownership interests generally take the form of
    “working interests” in oil and gas leases that have
    varying terms. International ownership interests generally arise
    from participation in production sharing contracts.

    The table below summarizes by year and geographic area our
    undeveloped acreage scheduled to expire in the next five years.
    In most cases, the drilling of a commercial well, or the filing
    and approval of a development plan or suspension of operations,
    will hold acreage beyond the expiration date. We own fee mineral
    interests in 396,407 gross (107,246 net) undeveloped acres.
    These interests do not expire.

Table of Contents





 



    Title to
    Properties


 


    We believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our
    producing properties in accordance with generally accepted
    industry standards. Individual properties may be subject to
    burdens such as royalty, overriding royalty, carried, net
    profits, working and other outstanding interests customary in
    the industry. In addition, interests may be subject to
    obligations or duties under applicable laws or burdens such as
    production payments, ordinary course liens incidental to
    operating agreements and for current taxes, development
    obligations under oil and gas leases or capital commitments
    under production sharing contracts or exploration licenses. As
    is customary in the industry in the case of undeveloped
    properties, often little investigation of record title is made
    at the time of acquisition. More detailed title work and
    investigations are made prior to the consummation of any
    acquisition of producing properties and before any commencement
    of drilling operations on undeveloped properties.



 



    Marketing


 


    Substantially all of our oil and gas production is sold to a
    variety of purchasers under short-term (less than
    12 months) contracts at market sensitive prices. For a list
    of purchasers of our oil and gas production that accounted for
    10% or more of our consolidated revenue for the three preceding
    calendar years, please see Note 1, “Organization and
    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Major
    Customers,” to our consolidated financial statements.
    We believe that the loss of any of these purchasers would not
    have a material adverse effect on us because alternative
    purchasers are readily available with the exception of
    purchasers of our Monument Butte field oil production. Due to
    the higher paraffin content of this production, there is limited
    refining capacity for it. Please see the discussion under
    “There is limited transportation and refining capacity
    for our black wax crude oil, which may limit our ability to sell
    our current production or to increase our production at Monument
    Butte in the Uinta Basin” in Item 1A of this
    report.



 



    Competition


 


    Competition in the oil and gas industry is intense, particularly
    with respect to the hiring and retention of technical personnel,
    the acquisition of properties and access to drilling rigs and
    other services. For a further discussion, please see the
    information regarding competition set forth in Item 1A of
    this report.



 



    Employees


 


    As of February 22, 2011, we had 1,352 employees. All
    but 123 of our employees were located in the U.S. None of
    our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
    We believe that relationships with our employees are
    satisfactory.



 



    Regulation


 


    Exploration and development and the production and sale of oil
    and gas are subject to extensive federal, state, local and
    international regulations. An overview of these regulations is
    set forth below. We believe we are in substantial compliance
    with currently applicable laws and regulations and that
    continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will
    not have a material adverse effect on our financial position,
    cash flows or results of operations. However, current regulatory
    requirements may change, currently unforeseen environmental
    incidents may occur or past non-compliance with environmental
    laws or regulations may be discovered. Please see the discussion
    under the captions “We are subject to complex laws that
    can affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing
    business” and “the potential adoption of
    federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives related
    to hydraulic fracturing could result in operating restrictions
    or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells.”

    Federal Regulation of Sales and Transportation of Natural
    Gas.  Our sales of natural gas are affected
    directly and indirectly by the availability, terms and cost of
    natural gas transportation. The prices and terms for access to
    pipeline transportation of natural gas are subject to extensive
    federal and state regulation. The transportation and sale for
    resale of natural gas in interstate commerce is regulated
    primarily under the Natural Gas Act (NGA) and by regulations and
    orders promulgated under the NGA by the FERC. In certain limited





    
    14



Table of Contents





    circumstances, intrastate transportation and wholesale sales of
    natural gas also may be affected directly or indirectly by laws
    enacted by Congress and by FERC regulations. The Outer
    Continental Shelf Lands Act, or OCSLA, requires that all
    pipelines operating on or across the shelf provide open-access,
    non-discriminatory service. There are currently no regulations
    implemented by the FERC under its OCSLA authority on gatherers
    and other entities outside the reach of its Natural Gas Act
    jurisdiction. Therefore, we do not believe that any FERC or
    BOEMRE action taken under OCSLA will affect us in a way that
    materially differs from the way it will affect other natural gas
    producers, gatherers and marketers with which we compete.


 


    Pursuant to authority enacted in the Energy Policy Act of 2005
    (2005 EPA), FERC has promulgated anti-manipulation regulations,
    violations of which make it unlawful for any entity, directly or
    indirectly, in connection with the purchase or sale of natural
    gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject
    to the jurisdiction of FERC to use or employ any device, scheme,
    or artifice to defraud, to make any untrue statement of a
    material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in
    order to make the statements made, in the light of the
    circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or to
    engage in any act, practice, or course of business that operates
    or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any entity. Violation
    of this requirement, similar to violations of other NGA and FERC
    requirements, may be penalized by the FERC up to $1 million
    per day per violation. FERC may also order disgorgement of
    profit and corrective action. We believe, however, that neither
    the 2005 EPA nor the regulations promulgated by FERC as a result
    of the 2005 EPA will affect us in a way that materially differs
    from the way they affect other natural gas producers, gatherers
    and marketers with which we compete.


 


    Our sales of natural gas and crude are also subject to
    requirements under the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and
    regulations promulgated thereunder by the Commodity Futures
    Trading Commission (CFTC). The CEA prohibits any person from
    manipulating or attempting to manipulate the price of any
    commodity in interstate commerce or futures on such commodity.
    The CEA also prohibits knowingly delivering or causing to be
    delivered false or misleading or knowingly inaccurate reports
    concerning market information or conditions that affect or tend
    to affect the price of a commodity.


 


    The current statutory and regulatory framework governing
    interstate natural gas transactions is subject to change in the
    future, and the nature of such changes is impossible to predict.
    Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the
    natural gas industry are pending before Congress, the FERC, the
    CFTC and the courts. The natural gas industry historically has
    been very heavily regulated. In the past, the federal government
    regulated the prices at which natural gas could be sold.
    Congress removed all price and non-price controls affecting
    wellhead sales of natural gas effective January 1, 1993.
    There is always some risk, however, that Congress may reenact
    price controls in the future. Changes in law and to FERC
    policies and regulations may adversely affect the availability
    and reliability of firm
    and/or
    interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines,
    and we cannot predict what future action the FERC will take.
    Therefore, there is no assurance that the current regulatory
    approach recently pursued by the FERC and Congress will
    continue. We do not believe, however, that any regulatory
    changes will affect us in a way that materially differs from the
    way they will affect other natural gas producers, gatherers and
    marketers with which we compete.


 


    Federal Regulation of Sales and Transportation of Crude
    Oil.  Our sales of crude oil and condensate
    are currently not regulated. In a number of instances, however,
    the ability to transport and sell such products are dependent on
    pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are
    subject to FERC jurisdiction under the Interstate Commerce Act.
    Certain regulations implemented by the FERC in recent years
    could result in an increase in the cost of transportation
    service on certain petroleum products pipelines. However, we do
    not believe that these regulations affect us any differently
    than other crude oil and condensate producers.


 


    Federal Leases.  Many of our domestic
    oil and gas leases are granted by the federal government and
    administered by the BOEMRE or the BLM, both federal agencies.
    BOEMRE and BLM leases contain relatively standardized terms and
    require compliance with detailed BLM or BOEMRE regulations and,
    in the case of offshore leases, orders pursuant to OCSLA (which
    are subject to change by the BOEMRE). Many onshore leases
    contain stipulations that may limit activities that may be
    conducted on the lease. Some stipulations are unique to
    particular geographic areas and may limit the timing and manner
    in which certain activities may be conducted or, in some cases,
    may prescribe no surface occupancy. For offshore operations,





    
    15



Table of Contents





    lessees must obtain BOEMRE approval for exploration, development
    and production plans prior to the commencement of such
    operations. In addition to permits required from other agencies
    (such as the Coast Guard, the Army Corps of Engineers and the
    Environmental Protection Agency), lessees must obtain a permit
    from the BLM or the BOEMRE, as applicable, prior to the
    commencement of drilling, and comply with regulations governing,
    among other things, engineering and construction specifications
    for production facilities, safety procedures, plugging and
    abandonment of wells on the Shelf and removal of facilities. To
    cover the various obligations of lessees on the Shelf, the
    BOEMRE generally requires that lessees have substantial net
    worth or post bonds or other acceptable assurances that such
    obligations will be met. The cost of such bonds or other surety
    can be substantial and there is no assurance that bonds or other
    surety can be obtained in all cases. We are currently exempt
    from the supplemental bonding requirements of the BOEMRE. Under
    certain circumstances, the BLM or the BOEMRE, as applicable, may
    require that our operations on federal leases be suspended or
    terminated. Any such suspension or termination could materially
    and adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows and
    results of operations.


 


    The BOEMRE regulations governing the calculation of royalties
    and the valuation of crude oil produced from federal leases
    provide that the BOEMRE will collect royalties based upon the
    market value of oil produced from federal leases. The 2005 EPA
    formalizes the royalty in-kind program of the BOEMRE, providing
    that the BOEMRE may take royalties in-kind if the Secretary of
    the Interior determines that the benefits are greater than or
    equal to the benefits that are likely to have been received had
    royalties been taken in value. We believe that the BOEMRE’s
    royalty in-kind program will not have a material effect on our
    financial position, cash flows or results of operations.


 


    In 2006, the BOEMRE amended its regulations to require
    additional filing fees. The BOEMRE has estimated that these
    additional filing fees will represent less than 0.1% of the
    revenues of companies with offshore operations in most cases. We
    do not believe that these additional filing fees will affect us
    in a way that materially differs from the way they affect other
    producers, gatherers and marketers with which we compete.


 


    State and Local Regulation of Drilling and
    Production.  We own interests in properties
    located onshore in a number of states and in state waters
    offshore Texas and Louisiana. These states regulate drilling and
    operating activities by requiring, among other things, permits
    for the drilling of wells, maintaining bonding requirements in
    order to drill or operate wells, and regulating the location of
    wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use
    and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled and
    the plugging and abandonment of wells. The laws of these states
    also govern a number of environmental and conservation matters,
    including the handling and disposing or discharge of waste
    materials, the size of drilling and spacing units or proration
    units and the density of wells that may be drilled, unitization
    and pooling of oil and gas properties and establishment of
    maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells. Some states
    have the power to prorate production to the market demand for
    oil and gas.


 


    Environmental Regulations.  Our
    operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating
    to environmental protection, including the discharge of
    substances into the environment, and permitting for oil and gas
    activities before, during or after operations begin. The cost to
    comply can be significant and failure to comply with these laws
    and regulations may result in administrative, civil and criminal
    penalties, the imposition of remedial and damage payment
    obligations, or injunctive relief (including orders to cease
    operations). Environmental laws and regulations are complex, and
    have tended to become more stringent over time. Oil and gas
    activities, both onshore and offshore, in certain areas have
    been opposed by environmental groups through public comments on
    agency actions and through litigation. Moreover, some
    environmental laws and regulations may impose strict liability,
    which could subject us to liability for conduct that was lawful
    at the time it occurred or conduct or conditions caused by prior
    operators or third parties. Governmental action, through either
    legislative or administrative venues, that prohibits or
    restricts onshore or offshore drilling thereby changing the
    business climate under which we operate may result in increased
    costs to the oil and gas industry in general and our business
    and financial results could be adversely affected.


 


    The Oil Pollution Act, or OPA, imposes regulations on
    “responsible parties” related to the prevention of oil
    spills and liability for damages resulting from spills in
    U.S. waters. A “responsible party” includes the





    
    16



Table of Contents





    owner or operator of an onshore facility, vessel or pipeline, or
    the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore
    facility is located. OPA assigns strict, joint and several
    liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a
    variety of public and private damages. While liability limits
    apply in some circumstances, a party cannot take advantage of
    such limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or
    willful misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal
    safety, construction or operating regulation, or if the party
    fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in the cleanup.
    Even if applicable, the liability limits for offshore facilities
    require the responsible party to pay all removal costs, plus up
    to $75 million in other damages for offshore facilities and
    up to $350 million for onshore facilities. Few defenses
    exist to the liability imposed by OPA. Failure to comply with
    ongoing requirements or inadequate cooperation during a spill
    event may subject a responsible party to administrative, civil
    or criminal enforcement actions.


 


    OPA also requires operators in the Gulf of Mexico to demonstrate
    to the BOEMRE that they possess available financial resources
    that are sufficient to pay for costs that may be incurred in
    responding to an oil spill. Under OPA and implementing BOEMRE
    regulations, responsible parties are required to demonstrate
    that they possess financial resources sufficient to pay for
    environmental cleanup and restoration costs of at least
    $10 million for an oil spill in state waters and at least
    $35 million for an oil spill in federal waters.


 


    In addition to OPA, our discharges to waters of the
    U.S. are further limited by the federal Clean Water Act, or
    CWA, and analogous state laws. The CWA prohibits any discharge
    into waters of the United States except in compliance with
    permits issued by federal and state governmental agencies.
    Failure to comply with the CWA, including discharge limits set
    by permits issued pursuant to the CWA, may also result in
    administrative, civil or criminal enforcement actions. The OPA
    and CWA also require the preparation of oil spill response plans
    and spill prevention, control and countermeasure or
    “SPCC” plans. We have such plans in place and have
    made changes as necessary due to changes by the
    U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, also known as the
    “EPA,” and delays in EPA rulemaking. The final EPA
    rule was published in November 2009 and became effective on
    January 14, 2010, with a compliance deadline of November
    2010.


 


    OCSLA authorizes regulations relating to safety and
    environmental protection applicable to lessees and permittees
    operating on the Shelf. Specific design and operational
    standards may apply to vessels, rigs, platforms, vehicles and
    structures operating or located on the Shelf. Violations of
    lease conditions or regulations issued pursuant to OCSLA can
    result in substantial administrative, civil and criminal
    penalties, as well as potential court injunctions curtailing
    operations and the cancellation of leases.


 


    The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, generally
    regulates the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and imposes
    certain environmental cleanup obligations. Although RCRA
    specifically excludes from the definition of hazardous waste
    “drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes
    associated with the exploration, development or production of
    crude oil, natural gas or geothermal energy,” the EPA and
    state agencies may regulate these wastes as solid wastes.
    Moreover, ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes,
    waste solvents, laboratory wastes and waste oils, may be
    regulated as hazardous waste.


 


    The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
    Liability Act, also known as CERCLA or the “Superfund”
    law, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard
    to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on persons
    that are considered to have contributed to the release of a
    “hazardous substance” into the environment. Such
    “responsible persons” may be subject to joint and
    several liability under the Superfund law for the costs of
    cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released
    into the environment and for damages to natural resources, and
    it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third
    parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage
    allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the
    environment. We currently own or lease onshore properties that
    have been used for the exploration and production of oil and gas
    for a number of years. Many of these onshore properties have
    been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or
    release of hydrocarbons or other wastes was not under our
    control. These properties and any wastes that may have been
    disposed or released on them may be subject to the Superfund
    law, RCRA and analogous state laws and common law obligations,
    and we potentially could be required to investigate and
    remediate such properties, including soil or groundwater
    contamination by prior owners or operators, or to perform
    remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future
    contamination.

    The Clean Air Act and comparable state statutes restrict the
    emission of air pollutants and affects both onshore and offshore
    oil and gas operations. New facilities may be required to obtain
    separate construction and operating permits before construction
    work can begin or operations may start, and existing facilities
    may be required to incur capital costs in order to remain in
    compliance. Also, the EPA has developed and continues to develop
    more stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air
    pollutants, and is considering the regulation of additional air
    pollutants and air pollutant parameters. These regulations may
    increase the costs of compliance for some facilities.


 


    The Safe Drinking Water Act and comparable state statutes
    restrict the disposal, treatment or release of water produced or
    used during oil and gas development. Subsurface emplacement of
    fluids (including disposal wells or enhanced oil recovery) is
    governed by federal or state regulatory authorities that, in
    some cases, includes the state oil and gas regulatory authority
    or the state’s environmental authority. These regulations
    may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities.


 


    The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires federal
    agencies to consider potential environmental impacts that may
    result from projects they approve. The process involves the
    preparation of either an environmental assessment or
    environmental impact statement depending on whether the specific
    circumstances surrounding the proposed federal action will have
    a significant impact on the human environment. The NEPA process
    involves public input through comments which can alter the
    nature of a proposed project either by limiting the scope of the
    project or requiring resource-specific mitigation. NEPA
    decisions can be appealed through the court system by process
    participants. These regulations may increase the costs of
    compliance for some facilities.


 


    The Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and comparable
    state statutes regulate the protection of the health and safety
    of workers. The OSHA hazard communication standard requires
    maintenance of information about hazardous materials used or
    produced in operations and provision of such information to
    employees. Other OSHA standards regulate specific worker safety
    aspects of our operations. Failure to comply with OSHA
    requirements can lead to the imposition of penalties.


 


    Congress has been actively considering legislation to reduce
    emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the development
    of greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. In June of 2009, the
    U.S. House of Representatives passed a cap and trade bill
    known as the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009
    although it was never passed by the U.S. Senate. In
    addition, more than one-third of the states already have begun
    implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse
    gases. Further, on April 2, 2007, the United States Supreme
    Court in Massachusetts, et al. v. EPA, held that carbon
    dioxide may be regulated as an “air pollutant” under
    the federal Clean Air Act. On April 24, 2009, EPA responded
    to the Massachusetts, et al. v. EPA decision with a
    proposed finding that the current and projected concentrations
    of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threaten the public health
    and welfare of current and future generations, and that certain
    greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles and motor vehicle
    engines contribute to the atmospheric concentrations of
    greenhouse gases and hence to the threat of climate change. EPA
    published the final version of this finding on December 15,
    2009, which allowed EPA to proceed with the rulemaking process
    to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. In
    anticipation of the finalization of EPA’s finding that
    greenhouse gases threaten public health and welfare, and that
    greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles contribute to climate
    change, EPA proposed a rule in September of 2009 that would
    require a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor
    vehicles and would trigger applicability of Clean Air Act
    permitting requirements for certain stationary sources of
    greenhouse gas emissions. In response to this issue, EPA also
    proposed a tailoring rule that would, in general, only impose
    greenhouse gas permitting requirements on facilities that emit
    more than 25,000 tons per year of greenhouse gases. Moreover, on
    September 22, 2009, EPA finalized a rule requiring
    nation-wide reporting of greenhouse gas emissions in 2011 for
    emissions occurring in 2010. The rule applies primarily to large
    facilities emitting 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon
    dioxide-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions per year, and to
    most upstream suppliers of fossil fuels and industrial
    greenhouse gas, as well as to manufacturers of vehicles and
    engines. Although it is not possible at this time to predict
    whether proposed legislation or regulations will be adopted as
    initially written, if at all, or how legislation or new
    regulation that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas
    emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and
    regulations could result in increased compliance costs or
    additional operating restrictions. Any





    
    18

    additional costs or operating restrictions associated with
    legislation or regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions
    could have a material adverse effect on our operating results
    and cash flows, in addition to the demand for the natural gas
    and other hydrocarbon products that we produce.


 


    International Regulations.  Our
    exploration and production operations outside the United States
    are subject to various types of regulations similar to those
    described above imposed by the respective governments of the
    countries in which we operate, and may affect our operations and
    costs within that country. We currently have operations in
    Malaysia and China.



 



    Commonly
    Used Oil and Gas Terms


 


    Below are explanations of some commonly used terms in the oil
    and gas business.

    Development well.  A well drilled within
    the proved area of an oil or gas reservoir to the depth of a
    stratigraphic horizon known to be productive.


 


    Exploitation well.  An exploration well
    drilled to find and produce probable reserves. Most of the
    exploitation wells we drill are located in the Mid-Continent or
    the Monument Butte field. Exploitation wells in those areas have
    less risk and less reserve potential and typically may be
    drilled at a lower cost than other exploration wells. For
    internal reporting and budgeting purposes, we combine
    exploitation and development activities.


 


    Exploration well.  An exploration well
    is a well drilled to find a new field or to find a new reservoir
    in a field previously found to be productive of oil or gas in
    another reservoir. Generally, an exploratory well is any well
    that is not a development well, an extension well, a service
    well, or a stratigraphic test well. For internal reporting and
    budgeting purposes, we exclude exploitation activities from
    exploration activities.

    Probable reserves.  Probable reserves
    are those additional reserves that are less certain to be
    recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved
    reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. The SEC provides
    a complete definition of probable reserves in
    Rule 4-10(a)(18)
    of
    Regulation S-X.


 


    Productive well.  A well that is found
    to be capable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities
    such that proceeds from the sale of such production exceed
    production expenses and taxes.


 


    Proved developed reserves.  In general,
    proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered from
    existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods.
    The SEC provides a complete definition of developed oil and gas
    reserves in
    Rule 4-10(a)(6)
    of
    Regulation S-X.


 


    Proved reserves.  Proved reserves are
    those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of
    geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with
    reasonable certainty to be economically producible —
    from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under
    existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government
    regulations — prior to the time at which contracts
    providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates
    that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether
    deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the
    estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have
    commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it
    will commence the project within a reasonable time.


 


    Proved undeveloped reserves.  In
    general, proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from
    new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a
    relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. The
    SEC provides a complete definition of undeveloped oil and gas
    reserves in
    Rule 4-10(a)(31)
    of
    Regulation S-X.

    Reserve life index.  This index is
    calculated by dividing total proved reserves at year end by
    annual production to estimate the number of years of remaining
    production.


 


    Shelf.  The U.S. Outer Continental
    Shelf of the Gulf of Mexico. Water depths generally range from
    50 feet to 1,000 feet.


 


    Tcfe.  One trillion cubic feet
    equivalent, determined using the ratio of six Mcf of natural gas
    to one barrel of crude oil or condensate.


 


    Unconventional “resource”
    plays.  Plays targeting tight sand, coal bed
    or gas shale reservoirs. The reservoirs tend to cover large
    areas and lack the readily apparent traps, seals and discrete
    hydrocarbon-water boundaries that typically define conventional
    reservoirs. These reservoirs generally require stimulation
    treatments or other special recovery processes in order to
    produce economically.


 


    Undeveloped acreage.  Lease acreage on
    which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that
    would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and
    gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves.


 


    Working interest.  The operating
    interest that gives the owner the right to drill, produce and
    conduct operating activities on the property and a share of
    production.


 





    
    



    
    Item 1A.  

    
    Risk
    Factors





 


    There are many factors that may affect Newfield’s business
    and results of operations. You should carefully consider, in
    addition to the other information contained in this report, the
    risks described below.


 


    Oil and gas prices fluctuate widely, and lower prices for
    an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse
    impact on our business.  Our revenues,
    profitability and future growth depend substantially on
    prevailing prices for oil and gas. Lower prices may reduce the
    amount of oil and gas that we can economically produce. Oil and
    gas prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for
    capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise
    additional capital.


 


    Among the factors that can cause fluctuations in oil and gas
    prices are:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    the domestic and foreign supply of oil, natural gas and natural
    gas liquids;




 



     
        • 

    
    the price and availability of, and demand for, alternative fuels;




 



     
        • 

    
    weather conditions and climate change;




 



     
        • 

    
    changes in supply and demand;




 



     
        • 

    
    world-wide economic conditions;




 



     
        • 

    
    the price of foreign imports;




 



     
        • 

    
    the availability, proximity and capacity of transportation
    facilities and processing facilities;




 



     
        • 

    
    the level and effect of trading in commodity futures markets,
    including commodity price speculators and others;




 



     
        • 

    
    political conditions in oil and gas producing regions; and




 



     
        • 

    
    the nature and extent of domestic and foreign governmental
    regulations and taxation, including environmental regulation.

    We have substantial capital requirements to fund our
    business plans, and a continued slow recovery of the economy and
    the financial markets in 2011 or another decline or crisis as
    was experienced in late 2008 and 2009 could negatively impact
    our ability to execute our business
    plan.  Although we anticipate that our 2011
    capital spending, excluding acquisitions, will correspond with
    our anticipated 2011 cash flows, we may borrow and repay funds
    under our credit arrangements throughout the year since the
    timing of expenditures and the receipt of cash flows from
    operations do not necessarily match. Actual levels of capital
    expenditures may vary significantly due to many factors,
    including drilling results, oil and gas prices, industry
    conditions, the prices and availability of goods and services
    and the extent to which properties are acquired. In addition, in
    the past, we often have increased our capital budget during the
    year as a result of acquisitions or successful drilling. We may
    have to reduce capital expenditures, and our ability to execute
    our business plans could be adversely affected, if (1) one
    or more of the lenders under our existing credit arrangements
    fail to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us;
    (2) the amount that we are allowed to borrow under our
    existing credit facility is reduced as a result of lower oil and
    gas prices, declines in reserves, lending requirements or for
    other reasons; or (3) our customers or working interest
    owners default on their obligations to us.


 


    To maintain and grow our production and cash flow, we must
    continue to develop existing reserves and locate or acquire new
    reserves.  Through our drilling programs and
    the acquisition of properties, we strive to maintain and grow
    our production and cash flow. However, as we produce from our
    properties, our reserves decline. We may be unable to find,
    develop or acquire additional reserves or production at an
    acceptable cost, if at all. In addition, these activities
    require substantial capital expenditures.


 


    Actual quantities of oil and gas reserves and future cash
    flows from those reserves will most likely vary from our
    estimates.  Estimating accumulations of oil
    and gas is complex. The process relies on interpretations of
    available geologic, geophysic, engineering and production data.
    The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The
    process also requires a number of economic assumptions, such as
    oil and gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital
    expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. The accuracy of a
    reserve estimate is a function of:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    the quality and quantity of available data;




 



     
        • 

    
    the interpretation of that data;




 



     
        • 

    
    the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions; and




 



     
        • 

    
    the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate.





 


    The proved and probable reserve information set forth in this
    report is based on estimates we prepared. Estimates prepared by
    others might differ materially from our estimates.


 


    Actual quantities of oil and gas reserves, future production,
    oil and gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures
    and operating expenses will most likely vary from our estimates,
    with the variability likely to be higher for probable reserves
    estimates. In addition, the methodologies and evaluation
    techniques that we use, which include the use of multiple
    technologies, data sources and interpretation methods, may be
    different than those used by our competitors. Further, reserve
    estimates are subject to the evaluator’s criteria and
    judgment and show important variability, particularly in the
    early stages of an oil and gas development. Any significant
    variance could materially affect the quantities and net present
    value of our reserves. In addition, we may adjust estimates of
    reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration
    and development activities and prevailing oil and gas prices.
    Our reserves also may be susceptible to drainage by operators on
    adjacent properties.


 


    You should not assume that the present value of future net cash
    flows is the current market value of our proved oil and gas
    reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we base the
    estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves
    on the unweighted average
    first-day-of-the-month
    commodity prices for the prior twelve months, adjusted for
    market differentials, and costs in effect at year-end. Actual
    future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than
    the prices and costs we used. In addition, actual production
    rates for future periods may vary significantly from the rates
    assumed in the calculation.

    Our use of oil and gas price hedging contracts may limit
    future revenues from price increases and involves the risk that
    our counterparties may be unable to satisfy their obligations to
    us.  We generally hedge a substantial, but
    varying, portion of our anticipated future oil and gas
    production for the next
    12-24 months
    as part of our risk management program. In the case of
    significant acquisitions, we may hedge acquired production for a
    longer period. In addition, we may utilize basis contracts to
    hedge the differential between the NYMEX Henry Hub posted prices
    and those of our physical pricing points. Reducing our exposure
    to price volatility is intended to help ensure that we have
    adequate funds available for our capital programs and to help us
    manage returns on some of our acquisitions and more price
    sensitive drilling programs. Although the use of hedging
    transactions limits the downside risk of price declines, it also
    may limit the benefit from price increases and expose us to the
    risk of financial loss in certain circumstances. Those
    circumstances include instances where our production is less
    than the hedged volume or there is a widening of price basis
    differentials between delivery points for our production and the
    delivery points assumed in the hedge transaction.


 


    Hedging transactions also involve the risk that counterparties,
    which generally are financial institutions, may be unable to
    satisfy their obligations to us. Although we have entered into
    hedging contracts with multiple counterparties to mitigate our
    exposure to any individual counterparty, if any of our
    counterparties were to default on its obligations to us under
    the hedging contracts or seek bankruptcy protection, it could
    have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our
    planned activities and could result in a larger percentage of
    our future production being subject to commodity price changes.
    In addition, in poor economic environments and tight financial
    markets, the risk of a counterparty default is heightened, and
    it is possible that fewer counterparties will participate in
    future hedging transactions, which could result in greater
    concentration of our exposure to any one counterparty or a
    larger percentage of our future production being subject to
    commodity price changes.


 


    Federal legislation regarding derivatives could have an
    adverse effect on our ability and cost of entering into
    derivative transactions.  On July 21,
    2010, the President signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
    Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Reform Act),
    which, among other provisions, establishes federal oversight and
    regulation of the
    over-the-counter
    derivatives market and entities that participate in that market.
    The new legislation requires the Commodities Futures Trading
    Commission (the CFTC) and the SEC to promulgate rules and
    regulations implementing the new legislation within
    360 days from the date of enactment. On October 1,
    2010, the CFTC introduced its first series of proposed rules
    coming out of the Dodd-Frank Reform Act. The effect of the
    proposed rules and any additional regulations on our business is
    currently uncertain. Of particular concern, the Dodd-Frank
    Reform Act does not explicitly exempt end users (such as us)
    from the requirements to post margins in connection with hedging
    activities. While several senators have indicated that it was
    not the intent of the Act to require margins from end users, the
    exemption is not in the act. The new requirements to be enacted,
    to the extent applicable to us or our derivatives
    counterparties, may result in increased costs and cash
    collateral requirements for the types of derivative instruments
    we use to hedge and otherwise manage our financial and
    commercial risks related to fluctuations in oil and gas
    commodity prices. Any of the foregoing consequences would cause
    us to reconsider our hedging activities and may limit our
    ability to mitigate any fluctuations in oil and gas prices,
    which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
    financial position, results of operations and cash flows.


 


    There is limited transportation and refining capacity for
    our black wax crude oil, which may limit our ability to sell our
    current production or to increase our production at Monument
    Butte in the Uinta Basin.  Most of the crude
    oil we produce in the Uinta Basin is known as “black
    wax” because it has higher paraffin content than crude oil
    found in most other major North American basins. Due to its wax
    content, it must remain heated during shipping, so our
    transportation options are limited. Currently, the oil is
    transported by truck to refiners in the Salt Lake City area. We
    currently have agreements in place with area refiners that
    secure base load sales of substantially all of our expected
    production in the Uinta Basin through the end of 2011. In the
    current economic environment, there is a risk that they may fail
    to satisfy their obligations to us under those contracts. During
    the fourth quarter of 2008, the largest purchaser of our black
    wax crude oil failed to pay for certain deliveries of crude oil
    and filed for bankruptcy protection. Although we continue to
    sell our black wax crude oil to that purchaser on a short-term
    basis that provides for more timely cash





    
    23



Table of Contents





    payments, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue
    to sell to this purchaser or that similar substitute
    arrangements could be made for sales of our black wax crude oil
    with other purchasers if desired. An extended loss of any of our
    largest purchasers could have a material adverse effect on us
    because there are limited purchasers of our black wax crude. We
    continue to work with refiners to expand the market for our
    existing black wax crude oil production and to secure additional
    capacity to allow for production growth. However, without
    additional refining capacity, our ability to increase production
    from the field may be limited.


 


    Drilling is a high-risk activity.  In
    addition to the numerous operating risks described in more
    detail below, the drilling of wells involves the risk that no
    commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be
    encountered. In addition, we often are uncertain as to the
    future cost or timing of drilling, completing and producing
    wells. Furthermore, our drilling operations may be curtailed,
    delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors,
    including:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    costs of, or shortages or delays in the availability of,
    drilling rigs, equipment and materials;




 



     
        • 

    
    adverse weather conditions and changes in weather patterns;




 



     
        • 

    
    unexpected drilling conditions;




 



     
        • 

    
    pressure or irregularities in formations;




 



     
        • 

    
    embedded oilfield drilling and service tools;




 



     
        • 

    
    equipment failures or accidents;




 



     
        • 

    
    lack of necessary services or qualified personnel;




 



     
        • 

    
    availability and timely issuance of required governmental
    permits and licenses;




 



     
        • 

    
    availability, costs and terms of contractual arrangements, such
    as leases, pipelines and related facilities to gather, process
    and compress, transport and market natural gas, crude oil and
    related commodities; and




 



     
        • 

    
    compliance with, or changes in, environmental, tax and other
    laws and regulations.





 


    We are subject to complex laws that can affect the cost,
    manner or feasibility of doing business.  In
    addition, potential regulatory actions could increase our costs
    and reduce our liquidity, delay our operations or otherwise
    alter the way we conduct our business. Exploration and
    development and the production and sale of oil and gas are
    subject to extensive federal, state, local and international
    regulation. We may be required to make large expenditures to
    comply with environmental and other governmental regulations.
    Matters subject to regulation include:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    the amounts and types of substances and materials that may be
    released into the environment;




 



     
        • 

    
    response to unexpected releases to the environment;




 



     
        • 

    
    reports and permits concerning exploration, drilling, production
    and other operations;




 



     
        • 

    
    the spacing of wells;




 



     
        • 

    
    unitization and pooling of properties;




 



     
        • 

    
    calculating royalties on oil and gas produced under federal and
    state leases; and




 



     
        • 

    
    taxation.





 


    Under these laws, we could be liable for personal injuries,
    property damage, oil spills, discharge of hazardous materials,
    remediation and
    clean-up
    costs, natural resource damages and other environmental damages.
    We also could be required to install expensive pollution control
    measures or limit or cease activities on lands located within
    wilderness, wetlands or other environmentally or politically
    sensitive areas. Failure to comply with these laws also may
    result in the suspension or termination of our operations and
    subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties as
    well as the imposition of corrective action orders. Any such





    
    24



Table of Contents





    liabilities, penalties, suspensions, terminations or regulatory
    changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial
    condition, results of operations or cash flows.


 


    In addition, changes to existing regulations or the adoption of
    new regulations may unfavorably impact us, our suppliers or our
    customers. For example, governments around the world have become
    increasingly focused on climate change matters. On April 2,
    2007, the United States Supreme Court in Massachusetts, et
    al. v. the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
    held that carbon dioxide may be regulated as an “air
    pollutant” under the federal Clean Air Act. On
    April 24, 2009, the EPA responded to the Massachusetts, et
    al. v. the EPA decision with a proposed finding that the
    current and projected concentrations of greenhouse gases in the
    atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and
    future generations, and that certain greenhouse gases from new
    motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines contribute to the
    atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and hence to the
    threat of climate change. The EPA published the final version of
    this finding on December 15, 2009, which allowed the EPA to
    proceed with the rulemaking process to regulate greenhouse gases
    under the Clean Air Act. In anticipation of the finalization of
    the EPA’s finding that greenhouse gases threaten public
    health and welfare, and that greenhouse gases from new motor
    vehicles contribute to climate change, the EPA proposed a rule
    in September 2009 that would require a reduction in emissions of
    greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and would trigger
    applicability of Clean Air Act permitting requirements for
    certain stationary sources of greenhouse gas emissions. In 2010,
    the EPA promulgated regulations requiring certain facility
    owners, as that term is defined under 40 C.F.R.
    Part 98, to report on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from
    facilities subject to said regulations, which includes, in some
    situations, facilities involved in the production of oil and
    natural gas. The initial reporting required under these
    regulations is forthcoming and will ultimately add regulatory
    burdens for reporting emissions on certain industries. Generally
    speaking, the rule applies primarily to large facilities
    emitting 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide-equivalent
    GHG emissions per year, and to most upstream suppliers of fossil
    fuels and industrial GHG, as well as to manufacturers of
    vehicles and engines. The new regulations could impact certain
    facilities in which we have interests (legal, equitable,
    operated or non-operated) by increasing the regulatory reporting
    requirements.


 


    Other proposed policy changes from regulatory agencies could
    also increase regulatory reporting requirements, such as
    hydraulic fracturing regulation on public lands proposed by the
    U.S. Department of the Interior. In addition, the
    U.S. Congress in the past has proposed legislation that
    directly impacts our industry, also covering areas such as
    emission reporting and reductions, the repeal of certain oil and
    gas tax incentives and tax deductions, and the regulation of
    over-the-counter
    commodity hedging activities. Similarly, in response to the 2010
    Macondo incident in the Gulf of Mexico, the U.S. Congress
    was considering a number of legislative proposals relating to
    the upstream oil and gas industry both onshore and offshore that
    could result in significant additional laws or regulations
    governing our operations in the United States, including a
    proposal to raise or eliminate the cap on liability for oil
    spill cleanups under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.


 


    In January 2011, the 112th Session of Congress convened and
    at the time this report was prepared, no legislation was
    actively being considered on the topics mentioned herein;
    however, it is possible that similar legislation as introduced
    in previous sessions of Congress will be introduced. These and
    other potential regulations, if introduced and passed in
    Congress, could increase our costs, reduce our liquidity, delay
    our operations or otherwise alter the way we conduct our
    business, negatively impacting our financial condition, results
    of operations and cash flows.


 


    Although it is not possible at this time to predict whether
    proposed legislation or regulations will be adopted as initially
    written, if at all, or how legislation or new regulation that
    may be adopted would impact our business, any such future laws
    and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or
    additional operating restrictions. Additional costs or operating
    restrictions associated with legislation or regulations could
    have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash
    flows, in addition to the demand for the natural gas and other
    hydrocarbon products that we produce.


 


    The potential adoption of federal and state legislative
    and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could
    result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of
    oil and gas wells.  Hydraulic fracturing is a
    commonly used process that involves using water, sand, and
    certain chemicals to fracture the





    
    25



Table of Contents





    hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to allow flow of hydrocarbons
    into the wellbore. The U.S. Congress has considered
    legislation that would require additional regulation affecting
    the hydraulic fracturing process. Consideration for new federal
    regulation and increased state oversight continues to arise. To
    determine if these chemicals could adversely affect drinking
    water supplies, the EPA announced in the first quarter of 2010
    its intention to conduct a comprehensive research study on the
    potential adverse effects that hydraulic fracturing may have on
    water quality and public health. The EPA has begun preparation
    for the study and expects to complete the study in 2012. In
    addition, various state-level initiatives in regions with
    substantial shale gas supplies may be proposed or implemented to
    regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals
    and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid
    constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement
    temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing in certain
    environmentally sensitive areas such as watersheds. Moreover,
    public debate over hydraulic fracturing and shale gas production
    has been increasing, and has resulted in delays of well permits
    in some areas.


 


    Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic
    fracturing process could lead to greater opposition, including
    litigation, to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic
    fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation
    could also lead to operational delays or increased operating
    costs in the production of oil and natural gas, including from
    the developing shale plays, or could make it more difficult to
    perform hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of any federal or
    state laws or the implementation of regulations regarding
    hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the
    completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance
    costs, which could adversely affect our financial position,
    results of operations and cash flows.


 


    Lower oil and gas prices and other factors have resulted
    in ceiling test writedowns in the past and may in the future
    result in additional ceiling test writedowns or other
    impairments.  We capitalize the costs to
    acquire, find and develop our oil and gas properties under the
    full cost accounting method. The net capitalized costs of our
    oil and gas properties may not exceed the present value of
    estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves. If net
    capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceed this
    limit, we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings. This
    is called a “ceiling test writedown.” As of
    December 31, 2008, we recorded a $1.8 billion
    ($1.1 billion after-tax) ceiling test writedown. We
    recorded an additional $1.3 billion ($854 million
    after-tax) ceiling test writedown as of March 31, 2009.
    Although a ceiling test writedown does not impact cash flows
    from operations, it does reduce our stockholders’ equity.
    Once recorded, a ceiling test writedown is not reversible at a
    later date even if oil and gas prices increase.


 


    The risk that we will be required to further write down the
    carrying value of our oil and gas properties increases when oil
    and gas prices are low or volatile. In addition, writedowns may
    occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our
    estimated proved reserves or our unproved property values, or if
    estimated future development costs increase. We may experience
    further ceiling test writedowns or other impairments in the
    future. In addition, any future ceiling test cushion would be
    subject to fluctuation as a result of acquisition or divestiture
    activity.


 


    The oil and gas business involves many operating risks
    that can cause substantial losses, and insurance may not protect
    us against all of these risks.  We are not
    insured against all risks. Our oil and gas exploration and
    production activities are subject to all of the operating risks
    associated with drilling for and producing oil and gas,
    including the risk of:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    fires and explosions;




 



     
        • 

    
    blow-outs;




 



     
        • 

    
    uncontrollable or unknown flows of oil, gas, formation water or
    drilling fluids;




 



     
        • 

    
    adverse weather conditions or natural disasters;




 



     
        • 

    
    pipe or cement failures and casing collapses;




 



     
        • 

    
    pipeline ruptures;




 



     
        • 

    
    discharges of toxic gases;







    
    26



Table of Contents




 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    build up of naturally occurring radioactive materials; and




 



     
        • 

    
    vandalism.





 


    If any of these events occur, we could incur substantial losses
    as a result of:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    injury or loss of life;




 



     
        • 

    
    severe damage or destruction of property and equipment, and oil
    and gas reservoirs;




 



     
        • 

    
    pollution and other environmental damage;




 



     
        • 

    
    investigatory and
    clean-up
    responsibilities;




 



     
        • 

    
    regulatory investigation and penalties;




 



     
        • 

    
    suspension of our operations; and




 



     
        • 

    
    repairs to resume operations.





 


    If we experience any of these problems, our ability to conduct
    operations could be adversely affected.


 


    Offshore and deepwater operations are subject to a variety of
    additional operating risks, such as capsizing, collisions and
    damage or loss from hurricanes or other adverse weather
    conditions. These conditions have in the past, and may in the
    future, cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt
    production. Some of our offshore operations, and most of our
    deepwater and international operations, are dependent upon the
    availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, natural gas
    gathering systems and processing facilities that we do not own.
    Necessary infrastructures have been in the past, and may be in
    the future, temporarily unavailable due to adverse weather
    conditions or other reasons or may not be available to us in the
    future at all or on acceptable terms.


 


    We maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these
    potential risks and losses. We may elect not to obtain insurance
    if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive
    relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and
    environmental risks generally are not insurable.


 


    The marketability of our production is dependent upon
    transportation and processing facilities over which we may have
    no control.  The marketability of our
    production depends in part upon the availability, proximity and
    capacity of pipelines, natural gas gathering systems and
    processing facilities. We deliver oil and gas through gathering
    systems and pipelines that we do not own. The lack of
    availability of capacity on these systems and facilities could
    reduce the price offered for our production or result in the
    shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of
    development plans for properties. Although we have some
    contractual control over the transportation of our production
    through some firm transportation arrangements, third-party
    systems and facilities may be temporarily unavailable due to
    market conditions or mechanical or other reasons, or may not be
    available to us in the future at a price that is acceptable to
    us. Any significant change in market factors or other conditions
    affecting these infrastructure systems and facilities, as well
    as any delays in constructing new infrastructure systems and
    facilities, could harm our business and, in turn, our financial
    condition, results of operations and cash flows.


 


    Exploration in deepwater involves significant financial
    risks, and we may be unable to obtain the drilling rigs or
    support services necessary for our deepwater drilling and
    development programs in a timely manner or at acceptable
    rates.  Much of the deepwater play lacks the
    physical and oilfield service infrastructure necessary for
    production. As a result, development of a deepwater discovery
    may be a lengthy process and requires substantial capital
    investment, and it is difficult to estimate the timing of our
    production. Because of the size of significant projects in which
    we invest, we may not serve as the operator. As a result, we may
    have limited ability to exercise influence over operations
    related to these projects or their associated costs. Our
    dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for
    these deepwater projects and our limited ability to influence
    operations and associated costs could prevent the realization of
    our targeted returns on capital or lead to unexpected future
    losses.

    We have risks associated with our
    non-U.S. operations.  Ownership
    of property interests and production operations in areas outside
    the United States is subject to the various risks inherent in
    international operations. These risks may include:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations;




 



     
        • 

    
    loss of revenue, property and equipment as a result of
    expropriation, nationalization, war or insurrection;




 



     
        • 

    
    increases in taxes and governmental royalties;




 



     
        • 

    
    forced renegotiation of, or unilateral changes to, or
    termination of contracts with governmental entities and
    quasi-governmental agencies;




 



     
        • 

    
    changes in laws and policies governing operations of
    non-U.S. based
    companies;




 



     
        • 

    
    our limited ability to influence or control the operation or
    future development of these non-operated properties;




 



     
        • 

    
    the operator’s expertise or other labor problems;




 



     
        • 

    
    difficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental entity
    because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign
    sovereignty over international operations; and




 



     
        • 

    
    other uncertainties arising out of foreign government
    sovereignty over our international operations.





 


    Our international operations also may be adversely affected by
    the laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign
    trade, taxation and investment. In addition, if a dispute arises
    with respect to our international operations, we may be subject
    to the exclusive jurisdiction of
    non-U.S. courts
    or may not be successful in subjecting
    non-U.S. persons
    to the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States.


 


    We may be subject to risks in connection with
    acquisitions.  The successful acquisition of
    producing properties requires an assessment of several factors,
    including:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    recoverable reserves;




 



     
        • 

    
    future oil and gas prices and their appropriate differentials;




 



     
        • 

    
    operating costs; and




 



     
        • 

    
    potential environmental and other liabilities.





 


    The accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain. In
    connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the
    subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent
    with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing
    or potential problems nor will it permit us to become
    sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their
    deficiencies and capabilities. Inspections will not likely be
    performed on every well or facility, and structural and
    environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when
    an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified,
    the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective
    contractual protection against all or part of the problems.


 


    Competition for experienced technical personnel may
    negatively impact our operations or financial
    results.  Our continued drilling success and
    the success of other activities integral to our operations will
    depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain
    experienced explorationists, engineers and other professionals.
    Competition for these professionals remains strong. We are
    likely to continue to experience increased costs to attract and
    retain these professionals.


 


    There is competition for available oil and gas
    properties.  Our competitors include major oil
    and gas companies, independent oil and gas companies and
    financial buyers. Some of our competitors may have greater and
    more diverse resources than we do. High commodity prices and
    stiff competition for acquisitions have in the past, and may in
    the future, significantly increase the cost of available
    properties.

    Our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, some of our
    arrangements with employees and Delaware law contain provisions
    that could discourage an acquisition or change of control of our
    company.  Our certificate of incorporation and
    bylaws contain provisions that may make it more difficult to
    effect a change of control of our company, to acquire us or to
    replace incumbent management. In addition, our change of control
    severance plan and agreements, our omnibus stock plans and our
    incentive compensation plan contain provisions that provide for
    severance payments and accelerated vesting of benefits,
    including accelerated vesting of restricted stock, restricted
    stock units and stock options, upon a change of control.
    Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law also
    imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations
    between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding
    common stock. These provisions could discourage or prevent a
    change of control or reduce the price our stockholders receive
    in an acquisition of our company.
