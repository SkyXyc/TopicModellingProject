The core competencies of this segment are ourtechnology and engineering expertise. Our production systems control the flow of crude oil and natural gas from producing wells. We specialize in offshore production systems and have manufacturing facilities near the world’s principal offshore oil and gas producing basins. We primarily market our products through our own technical sales organization.Principal Products and ServicesSubsea Systems. Our systems are used in the offshore production of crude oil and natural gas. Subsea systems are placed on the seafloor and are used to control the flow of crude oil and natural gas from the reservoir to a host processing facility, such as a floating production facility, a fixed platform or an onshore facility.The design and manufacture of our subsea systems requires a high degree of technical expertise and innovation. Some of our systems are designed to withstand exposure to the extreme hydrostatic pressure that deepwater environments present, as well as internal pressures of up to 15,000 pounds per square inch (“psi”) and temperatures in excess of 350º F. The development of our integrated subsea production systems includes initial engineering design studies and field development planning to consider all relevant aspects and project requirements including optimization of drilling programs and subsea architecture. Our subsea production systems and products include drilling systems, subsea trees, chokes and flow modules, manifold pipeline systems, control and data acquisition systems, well access systems and other technologies.  Additionally, as part of our technologies to enhance field economics by maximizing recovery, our subsea processing systems can enable cost-effective, platform-less solutions where the field is tied directly back to an existing offshore facility or directly to shore. Subsea processing system solutions include subsea boosting, subsea gas compression and subsea separation which are designed to accelerate production, increase recovery or extend field life. In order to provide these products, systems and services, we utilize engineering, project management, procurement, manufacturing, assembly and testing capabilities.We also provide well access and flow management services and other customer support services that offer a broad range of products and services including installation and workover tools, service technicians for installation assistance and field support for commissioning, intervention, and maintenance of our subsea systems throughout the life of the field. This scope of activity also includes providing tools and technical support such as our riserless light well intervention system for certain well workover and intervention tasks. In 2012 FMC Technologies formed a joint venture with Edison Chouest Offshore LLC to provide integrated vessel-based subsea services for offshore oil and gas fields around the world. This joint venture is expected to provide cost-effective solutions to enhance our customer’s ability to initiate, maintain and increase production from subsea field developments through efficient operations, innovative technologies and a broad inventory of vessels and tools.Subsea systems represented approximately 63%, 63% and 62% of our consolidated revenue in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.Schilling Robotics. We design and manufacture ROVs and manipulator arms and provide support services for subsea control systems for subsea exploration and production. Our product offering includes electric and hydraulic work-class ROVs, tether-management systems, launch and recovery systems, remote manipulator arms and modular control systems for wide-ranging subsea applications.

We design and manufacture multiphase and wetgas meters with applications that include production and surface well testing, reservoir monitoring, remote operation of entire fields, measurement of fluid rates for production and revenue sharing between partners, process monitoring and control, and artificial lift optimization. This technology delivers highly accurate, self-calibrating meters with low maintenance features to meet our customers’ increasing requirements for subsea and topside applications. The Multi Phase Meters product line augments our portfolio of technologies for increasing oil and gas recovery, early water detection and reservoir optimization.5Capital IntensityMany of the systems and products we supply for subsea applications are highly engineered to meet the unique demands of our customers’ field properties and are typically ordered one to two years prior to installation. We often receive advance and progress payments from our customers in order to fund initial development and our working capital requirements. However, our working capital balances can vary significantly depending on the payment terms and execution timing on key contracts.Dependence on Key CustomersGenerally, our customers in this segment are major integrated oil companies, national oil companies and independent exploration and production companies.We have actively pursued alliances with oil and gas companies that are engaged in the subsea development of crude oil and natural gas to promote our integrated systems for subsea production. Development of subsea fields, particularly in deepwater environments, involves substantial capital investments by our customers. Our customers have sought the security of alliances with us to ensure timely and cost-effective delivery of subsea and other energy-related systems that provide integrated solutions to their needs. Our alliances establish important ongoing relationships with our customers. While our alliances do not contractually commit our customers to purchase our systems and services, they have historically led to, and we expect that they will continue to result in, such purchases. Examples of customers we have entered alliances with include Statoil, Shell, BP and Anadarko.Petrobras is a key customer for the Subsea Technologies segment. During early 2014, Brazilian authorities triggered an investigation into Petrobras wholly unrelated to FMC Technologies. As a result of the investigation at Petrobras, our operational performance may be affected by any significant changes in Petrobras’ operational activities. As part of our strong customer relationship, we are working with Petrobras to delay certain deliveries of product in 2015 which may affect our cash flows. During 2014, we did not take any bad debt charges related to this customer.The loss of one or more of our significant oil and gas company customers could have a material adverse effect on our Subsea Technologies business segment. No single Subsea Technologies customer accounted for 10% or more of our 2014 consolidated revenue.CompetitionSubsea Technologies competes with other companies that supply subsea systems and with smaller companies that are focused on a specific application, technology or geographical niche in which we operate. Companies including OneSubsea, GE Oil & Gas, Aker Solutions and Dril-Quip compete with us in the marketplace across our various Subsea Technologies product lines.Competitive factors in our industry include reliability, cost-effective technology, execution and delivery. Our competitive strengths include our intellectual capital, our execution of our projects, reliability of our products, experience base and breadth of technologies embedded in our products and services that enable us to design unique solutions for our customers’ project requirements while incorporating standardized components to contain costs. We maintain a presence in all of the world’s major producing basins. Our strong customer relationships, experience and technology help us maintain a leadership position in subsea systems.SeasonalityIn the North Sea, winter weather generally subdues drilling activity and demand for subsea services as certain activities cannot be performed. As a result, the level of offshore activity in our subsea services is negatively influenced and tends to decrease in the first quarter of the year.6Surface TechnologiesSurface Technologies designs and manufactures products and systems and provides services used by oil and gas companies involved in land and offshore exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas. We design, manufacture and supply technologically advanced high pressure valves, pumps and fittings used in stimulation activities for oilfield service companies and provide flowback and wireline services for exploration and production companies in the oil and gas industry.Principal Products and ServicesSurface Wellhead. We provide a full range of drilling, completion and production wellhead systems for both standard and custom-engineered applications. Surface wellhead production systems, or trees, are used to control and regulate the flow of crude oil and natural gas from the well. Our surface wellhead products and systems are used worldwide on both onshore and offshore applications and can be used in difficult climates, including arctic cold or desert high temperatures. Our product technologies include conventional wellheads, unihead drill-thru wellheads designed for faster surface installations, drilling time optimization (“DTO”) timesaving conventional wellheads designed to reduce overall rig time and other technologies including sealing technology, thermal equipment, and valves and actuators. We support our customers through comprehensive surface wellhead system service packages that provide strategic solutions to ensure optimal equipment performance and reliability and include all phases of the asset’s life cycle, from the early planning stages through testing and installation, commissioning and operations, replacement and upgrades, interventions, decommissioning/abandonment, and maintenance, storage and preservations. In addition, our integrated shale services include manifolds and trees and flow back equipment for timely and cost-effective well completion.Surface wellhead represented approximately 15%, 14% and 13% of our consolidated revenue in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.Fluid Control. We design and manufacture flowline products, under the Weco®/Chiksan® trademarks, manifold trailers, well service pumps, compact valves and reciprocating pumps used in well completion and stimulation activities by major oilfield service companies, such as Schlumberger Limited, Baker Hughes Incorporated, Halliburton Company and Weatherford International plc. Our flowline products are used in equipment that pumps fluid into a well during the well construction and stimulation processes. Our well service pump product line includes Triplex and Quintuplex pumps utilized in a variety of applications including fracturing, acidizing and matrix stimulation and are capable of delivering flow rates up to 35 barrels per minute at pressures up to 20,000 psi. The performance of this business typically rises and falls with variations in the active rig count throughout the world and pressure pumping activity in the Americas.Fluid control represented approximately 8%, 8% and 12% of our consolidated revenue in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.Completion Services. We provide flowback services, cased hole electric wireline and slickline services, specialty logging services, pressure transient analysis, and well optimization services for exploration companies in the oil and gas industry. Acquired in October 2012 and formerly known as Pure Energy Services Ltd., our completion services business offers flowback services that provide our customers the well services necessary for the recovery of solids, fluids and hydrocarbons from oil and natural gas wells after the stimulation of the well and can involve high pressure or multi-well pad operations.Capital IntensitySurface Technologies manufactures most of its products, resulting in a reliance on manufacturing locations throughout the world. We also maintain a large amount of rental equipment related to pressure pumping operations.Dependence on Key CustomersNo single Surface Technologies customer accounted for 10% or more of our 2014, 2013 or 2012 consolidated revenue.7CompetitionSurface Technologies is a market leader for its primary products and services. Some of the competitive factors include technological innovation, reliability and product quality. Surface Technologies competes with other companies that supply surface production equipment and pressure pumping products. Some of our major competitors include Cameron International Corporation, Weir Oil & Gas, GE Oil & Gas and Gardner Denver, Inc.SeasonalityIn western Canada, the level of activity in the oilfield services industry is influenced by seasonal weather patterns. During the spring months, wet weather and the spring thaw make the ground unstable and less capable of supporting heavy equipment and machinery. As a result, municipalities and provincial transportation departments enforce road bans that restrict the movement of heavy equipment, which reduces activity levels. There is greater demand for oilfield services provided by our completion services business in the winter season when freezing permits the movement and operation of heavy equipment. Activities tend to increase in the fall and peak in the winter months of November through March.8Energy InfrastructurePrincipal Products and ServicesMeasurement Solutions. We design, manufacture and supply measurement products for the worldwide oil and gas industry. Our flow computers and control systems manage and monitor liquid and gas measurement for applications such as custody transfer, fiscal measurement and batch loading and deliveries. Our floating production, storage and off-loading metering systems provide the precision and reliability required for measuring large flow rates characteristic of marine loading operations. Our measurement systems provide many solutions in energy-related applications such as crude oil and natural gas production and transportation, refined product transportation, petroleum refining, and petroleum marketing and distribution. We combine advanced measurement technology with state-of-the-art electronics and supervisory control systems to provide the measurement of both liquids and gases to ensure processes operate efficiently while reducing operating costs and minimizing the risk associated with custody transfer.We also provide design, engineering, project management, training, commissioning and aftermarket services in connection with the applications of blending and transfer technology solutions and process automation systems for manufacturers in the lubricant, petroleum, fuel blending, and additive and chemical industries.Loading Systems. We provide land- and marine-based fluid loading and transfer systems to the oil and gas, petrochemical and chemical industries. Our systems provide transfer loading solutions using Chiksan loading arms and Chiksan swivel joint technologies capable of diverse applications. While our marine systems are typically constructed on a fixed jetty platform, we have developed advanced loading systems that can be mounted on a vessel or structure to facilitate ship-to-ship and tandem loading and offloading operations in open seas or exposed locations. Both our land- and marine- based loading and transfer systems are capable of handling a wide range of products including petroleum products, liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) and chemical products.Separation Systems. We design and manufacture systems that separate production flows from wells into oil, gas, sand and water. Our separation technology improves upon conventional separation technologies by moving the flow in a spiral, spinning motion. This causes the elements of the flow stream to separate more efficiently than conventional separation technologies. These systems are currently capable of subsea and topside applications. For subsea separation, performing a part of the required separation process at the seabed enables our customers to have more effective production and reduces the need for topside processing capacity. We are able to apply subsea separation technologies for both greenfield development and retrofit solutions for fields currently in production in order to reduce costs for topside facilities and increase production and recovery of fields.Automation and Control. We provide automation, control and information technology for the oil and gas and other industries. Acquired in April 2012 and formerly known as Control Systems International, Inc., our automation and control business is a supplier of innovative control and automation system solutions. One of the business’ primary product, UCOS®, is a comprehensive software solution that combines distributed control system and supervisory control and data acquisition system retrofits using software solutions and compression control algorithms which allows customers to control and manage the engineering, design and monitoring of their systems of operations.Dependence on Key CustomersNo single Energy Infrastructure customer accounted for 10% or more of our 2014, 2013 or 2012 consolidated revenue.9OTHER BUSINESS INFORMATION RELEVANT TO OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTSProduct DevelopmentWe continue to invest in product development to advance technologies necessary to support the current and future technical challenges of our customers. New products and services are developed in order to ensure our ability to tender in upcoming projects and to enable our growth platforms. We also strive to increase standardization within our product lines in order to reduce delivery times, improve product integrity and control costs. To satisfy all these aims, we are focused on leveraging capabilities and advanced technologies across all of our businesses.In our Subsea Technologies segment, we seek to invest in new technology that will enable the development of our customers’ fields. We continue to expand the portfolio of solutions in order to deliver a complete production system for high pressure, high temperature (“HPHT”) applications. In 2014 we entered into a joint development agreement with several major operators to develop common standards for subsea production equipment capable of operating at pressures as high as 20,000 psi and temperatures up to 350º F. We believe standardization is an important element in improving execution, optimizing resources, lowering life cycle costs and providing superior long-term value. This agreement is expected to result in standardized materials, processes and interfaces and is expected to deliver improved reliability and operability over the life of the field. During 2014 we continued work to complete the portfolio of capabilities to support these applications with systems for high integrity pressure protection (“HIPPS”) and completion workover risers (“CWOR”). Also in 2014, our third generation of ultra-heavy duty work class ROVs, the UHD-III, was completed and delivered to the market. This recent evolution of ROV technology features a new hydraulic pumping system capable of operating underwater valves in emergency situations, a tool dynamic positioning system, and a high definition Ethernet video system enhancing vehicle operation for ROV pilots.In addition to the development of new technology for challenging fields, we also seek to develop solutions that will help operators maximize recovery from existing subsea fields. We continue to advance the development of motor and drive solutions for pumps in order to expand our subsea product portfolio and to meet a broader set of market needs. Along with our development partner, Sulzer Pumps Ltd, development work progressed on a pump system capable of operating at higher pressures and temperatures compared to solutions currently available in the market.Standardization of subsea equipment is key to achieve reductions in cost and improved performance. In 2014 our next generation Master Control Station featuring our proprietary User Configurable Open System (UCOS®) software was completed, installed and commissioned offshore. The modular UCOS software platform allows for greater flexibility and scalability and will be utilized as the standard for control system applications in subsea production, processing and workover systems. Additionally, the next generation of standard electric and hydraulic actuators were completed and delivered for field application. The E3 hydraulic actuator features design improvements that will offer improved reliability. The G2i electric actuator was designed for improved manufacturability and qualified according to the highest industrial standards. The G2i electric actuator will be a key component in subsea production and processing systems.We are also expanding our subsea services portfolio to provide more services that maximize production and recovery over the life of the field. In January 2015, we completed the construction of a fourth riserless light well intervention (“RLWI”) system capable of operating at water depths up to 6,000 ft. RLWI is a cost-effective, rigless intervention solution designed to perform various types of jobs in offshore wells that will improve and optimize recovery using smaller, purpose-built intervention vessels rather than rigs.In our Surface Technologies segment, development work focused on enhancing our capabilities to provide products and services to support our integrated shale operations. Development work was completed on de-sanding technology designed to improve the performance of flowback operations. Pilot units were produced and successfully tested in the field. Our fluid control business also completed development and launched the ePRV, an electronic pressure relief valve. The ePRV is the first fully electronic pressure relief valve for the pressure pumping market, providing improved accuracy and serviceability. Additional investments in Surface Technologies were directed toward the expansion of capabilities to support shallow water production. The JXT (Jack-Up X-mas Tree) and JXT-3 designs were delivered to the field. These standard products provide production options that enable operators to minimize time to first oil and reduce capital investments.In our Energy Infrastructure segment, our loading systems business unit completed development on an all-electric marine loading arm. The electric drives are easier to maintain and more efficient to operate compared to existing hydraulic arms.10Order BacklogInformation regarding order backlog is incorporated herein by reference from the section entitled “Inbound Orders and Order Backlog” in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Sources and Availability of Raw MaterialsOur business segments purchase carbon steel, stainless steel, aluminum and steel castings and forgings both domestically and internationally.

RISK FACTORSImportant risk factors that could impact our ability to achieve our anticipated operating results and growth plan goals are presented below. The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with discussions of our business and the factors affecting our business located elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC.Demand for our systems and services depends on oil and gas industry activity and expenditure levels, which are directly affected by trends in the demand for and price of crude oil and natural gas.We are substantially dependent on conditions in the oil and gas industry, including the level of exploration, development and production activity of, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil and natural gas companies. Any substantial or extended decline in these expenditures may result in the reduced pace of discovery and development of new reserves of oil and gas and the reduced exploitation of existing wells, which could adversely affect demand for our systems and services and, in certain instances, result in the cancellation, modification or rescheduling of existing orders in our backlog. These factors could have an adverse effect on our revenue and profitability. The level of exploration, development and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices, which, historically, have been volatile.Factors affecting the prices of oil and natural gas include, but are not limited to, the following:•demand for hydrocarbons, which is affected by worldwide population growth, economic growth rates and general economic and business conditions;•costs of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;•political and economic uncertainty and sociopolitical unrest;•available excess production capacity within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) and the level of oil production by non-OPEC countries;•oil refining capacity and shifts in end-customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use of natural gas;•technological advances affecting energy consumption;•potential acceleration of the development of alternative fuels;•access to capital and credit markets, which may affect our customers’ activity levels and spending for our products and services; and•natural disasters.The oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns, which have been characterized by diminished demand for oilfield services and downward pressure on the prices we charge. A significant downturn in the oil and gas industry could result in a reduction in demand for oilfield services and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.The industries in which we operate or have operated expose us to potential liabilities arising out of the installation or use of our systems that could adversely affect our financial condition.We are subject to equipment defects, malfunctions and failures, equipment misuse and natural disasters, the occurrence of which may result in uncontrollable flows of gas or well fluids, fires and explosions. Although we have obtained insurance against many of these risks, our insurance may not be adequate to cover our liabilities. Further, the insurance may not generally be available in the future or, if available, premiums may not be commercially justifiable. If we incur substantial liability and the damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits, or if we were to incur liability at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance, such potential liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.13Our operations require us to comply with numerous U.S. and international regulations, violations of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.We are exposed to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations relating to matters such as environmental, health and safety, labor and employment, import/export control, currency exchange, bribery and corruption and taxation. These laws and regulations are complex, frequently change and have tended to become more stringent over time. In the event the scope of these laws and regulations expand in the future, the incremental cost of compliance could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Our operations outside of the United States require us to comply with numerous anti-bribery and anti-corruption regulations under the laws of the United States and various other countries. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) Bribery Act and the Brazilian Anti-Bribery Act (also known as the Brazilian Clean Company Act), among others, apply to us and our operations. We have internal control policies and procedures and have implemented training and compliance programs for our employees and agents with respect to these regulations. However, our policies, procedures and programs may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents, and severe criminal or civil sanctions may be imposed as a result of violations of these laws. We are also subject to the risks that our employees, joint venture partners and agents outside of the United States may fail to comply with applicable laws.Moreover, we import raw materials, semi-finished goods, as well as finished products into many countries for use in such countries or for manufacturing and/or finishing for re-export and import into another country for use or further integration into equipment or systems. Most movement of raw materials, semi-finished or finished products involves imports and exports.  As a result, compliance with multiple trade sanctions, embargoes and import/export laws and regulations, as well as the recently enacted conflict minerals reporting requirements, pose a constant challenge and risk to us since our business is conducted on a worldwide basis through various subsidiaries. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could materially affect our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may adversely affect our business and operating results.   Environmental laws and regulations in the United States and regulations in foreign countries affect the equipment, systems and services we design, market and sell, as well as the facilities where we manufacture our equipment and systems. We are required to invest financial and managerial resources to comply with environmental laws and regulations and believe that we will continue to be required to do so in the future. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, or the issuance of orders enjoining operations. These laws and regulations, as well as the adoption of new legal requirements or other laws and regulations affecting exploration and development of drilling for crude oil and natural gas, could adversely affect our business and operating results by increasing our costs, limiting the demand for our systems and services or restricting our operations.International, national and state governments and agencies are currently evaluating and/or promulgating legislation and regulations that are focused on restricting emissions commonly referred to as greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. For instance, under the U.S. Clean Air Act, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has made findings that GHG emissions endanger public health and the environment, resulting in the EPA’s adoption of regulations requiring construction and operating permit reviews of certain stationary sources with major emissions of GHGs, which reviews may require the installation of best available control technologies typically approved by the states and the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain sources, including onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities and onshore oil and natural gas processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities. In addition, in June 2014, the EPA, acting under President Obama’s Climate Action Plan, proposed its Clean Power Plan, which would set U.S. state-by-state guidelines for power plants to reduce their carbon emissions and cut pollution, nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide. To the extent our customers are subject to these or other similar proposed or newly enacted laws and regulations, the additional costs incurred by our customers to comply with such laws and regulations could impact their ability or desire to continue to operate at current or anticipated levels, which would negatively impact their demand for our systems and services. In addition, any new laws or regulations establishing cap-and-trade and those that favor the increased use of non-fossil fuels may dampen demand for oil and gas production and lead to lower spending by our customers for our systems and services. Similarly, to the extent we are or become subject to any of these or other similar proposed or newly enacted laws and regulations, we expect that our efforts to monitor, report and comply with such laws and regulations, and any related taxes imposed on companies by such programs, will increase our cost of doing business and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.14Moreover, environmental concerns have been raised regarding the potential impact of hydraulic fracturing or “fracking” on underground water supplies. We provide equipment and services to companies employing this enhanced recovery technique. There have been several regulatory and governmental initiatives in the United States to restrict the hydraulic fracturing process, which could have an adverse impact on our customers’ completion or production activities. For example, the U.S. Department of the Interior has issued proposed regulations that would apply to hydraulic fracturing operations on wells that are subject to federal oil and gas leases and that would impose requirements regarding the disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process, as well as requirements to obtain certain federal approvals before proceeding with hydraulic fracturing at a well site. This and other similar state and foreign regulatory initiatives, if adopted, would establish additional levels of regulation for our customers that could make it more difficult for our customers to complete natural gas and oil wells and could adversely affect the demand for our equipment and services, which, in turn, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Disruptions in the political, regulatory, economic and social conditions of the countries in which we conduct business could adversely affect our business or results of operations.We operate manufacturing facilities in the United States and in various countries across the world. Instability and unforeseen changes in any of the markets in which we conduct business, including economically and politically volatile areas such as North Africa, West Africa, the Middle East and the Commonwealth of Independent States, could have an adverse effect on the demand for our systems and services, our financial condition or our results of operations. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:•nationalization and expropriation;•potentially burdensome taxation;•inflationary and recessionary markets, including capital and equity markets;•civil unrest, labor issues, political instability, terrorist attacks, cyber-terrorism, military activity and wars;•supply disruptions in key oil producing countries;•ability of OPEC to set and maintain production levels and pricing;•trade restrictions, trade protection measures or price controls;•foreign ownership restrictions;•import or export licensing requirements;•restrictions on operations, trade practices, trade partners and investment decisions resulting from domestic and foreign laws and regulations;•changes in, and the administration of, laws and regulations;•inability to repatriate income or capital;•reductions in the availability of qualified personnel;•foreign currency fluctuations or currency restrictions; and•fluctuations in the interest rate component of forward foreign currency rates.Because a significant portion of our revenue is denominated in foreign currencies, changes in exchange rates will produce fluctuations in our revenue, costs and earnings and may also affect the book value of our assets located outside of the United States and the amount of our stockholders’ equity. Although it is our policy to seek to minimize our currency exposure by engaging in hedging transactions where appropriate, our efforts may not be successful. Moreover, certain currencies, specifically currencies in countries such as Angola and Nigeria where we have expanding operations, do not actively trade in the global foreign exchange markets and may subject us to increased foreign currency exposures. To the extent we sell our products and services in foreign markets, currency fluctuations may result in our products and services becoming too expensive for foreign customers. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect our financial position or results of operations.15We may lose money on fixed-price contracts.As is customary for the types of businesses in which we operate, we often agree to provide products and services under fixed-price contracts. Under these contracts, we are typically responsible for cost overruns. Our actual costs and any gross profit realized on these fixed-price contracts may vary from the estimated amounts on which these contracts were originally based. There is inherent risk in the estimation process, including significant unforeseen technical and logistical challenges or longer than expected lead times. A fixed-price contract may prohibit our ability to mitigate the impact of unanticipated increases in raw material prices through increased pricing. Depending on the size of a project, variations from estimated contract performance could have a significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Disruptions in the timely delivery of our backlog could affect our future sales, profitability, and our relationships with our customers.Many of the contracts we enter into with our customers require long manufacturing lead times due to complex technical and logistical requirements. These contracts may contain penalty clauses relating to on-time delivery, and a failure by us to deliver in accordance with customer expectations could subject us to contractual penalties, reduce our margins on these contracts or result in damage to existing customer relationships. The ability to meet customer delivery schedules for this backlog is dependent on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, access to the raw materials required for production, an adequately trained and capable workforce, subcontractor performance, project engineering expertise, sufficient manufacturing plant capacity and appropriate planning and scheduling of manufacturing resources. Failure to deliver backlog in accordance with expectations could negatively impact our financial performance, particularly in light of the current industry environment where customers may seek to improve their returns or cash flows.Due to the types of contracts we enter into, the cumulative loss of several major contracts or alliances may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.We often enter into large, long-term contracts that, collectively, represent a significant portion of our revenue. These agreements, if terminated or breached, may have a larger impact on our operating results or our financial condition than shorter-term contracts due to the value at risk. If we were to lose several key alliances or agreements over a relatively short period of time we could experience a significant adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Increased costs of raw materials and other components may result in increased operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows.Our results of operations may be adversely affected by our inability to manage the rising costs and availability of raw materials and components used in our wide variety of products and systems. Unexpected changes in the size and timing of regional and/or product markets, particularly for short lead-time products, could affect our results of operations or cash flows.Moreover, in August 2012, the SEC issued its final rule to implement Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act regarding mandatory disclosure and reporting requirements by public companies of their use of “conflict minerals” (tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold) originating in the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. We conducted required due diligence activities for the 2013 calendar year and filed our first Form SD report with the SEC in June 2014. While the conflict minerals rule continues in effect as adopted, there remains uncertainty regarding how the conflict minerals rule, and our compliance obligations, will be affected in the future. Specifically, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit largely upheld the conflict minerals rule in April 2014, but in November 2014, it granted the SEC’s and Amnesty International’s petitions for rehearing regarding certain disclosure requirements of the rule. Additional requirements under the rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain of the conflict minerals used in the manufacture of our products or in the provision of our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to purchase these products in the future. The costs of compliance, including those related to supply chain research, the limited number of suppliers and possible changes in the sourcing of these minerals, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows.16A failure of our information technology infrastructure could adversely impact our business and results of operations.The efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology (“IT”) systems. Accordingly, we rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our IT hardware and software infrastructure and our ability to expand and update this infrastructure in response to our changing needs. Despite our implementation of security measures, our systems are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses, natural disasters, incursions by intruders or hackers, failures in hardware or software, power fluctuations, cyber terrorists and other similar disruptions. Although no such material incidents have occurred to date, the failure of our IT systems to perform as anticipated for any reason or any significant breach of security could disrupt our business and result in numerous adverse consequences, including reduced effectiveness and efficiency of operations, inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, increased overhead costs and loss of important information, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.Our success depends on our ability to implement new technologies and services.Our success depends on the ongoing development and implementation of new product designs and improvements and on our ability to protect and maintain critical intellectual property assets related to these developments. If we are not able to obtain patent or other protection of our technology, we may not be able to continue to develop systems, services and technologies to meet evolving industry requirements, and if so, at prices acceptable to our customers.Uninsured claims and litigation against us, including intellectual property litigation, could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.We could be impacted by the outcome of pending litigation, as well as unexpected litigation or proceedings. We have insurance coverage against operating hazards, including product liability claims and personal injury claims related to our products, to the extent deemed prudent by our management and to the extent insurance is available. However, no assurance can be given that the nature and amount of that insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities arising out of pending and future claims and litigation. Our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected by unexpected claims not covered by insurance.In addition, the tools, techniques, methodologies, programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. Infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business. Royalty payments under licenses from third parties, if available, would increase our costs. If a license were not available, we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, developing non-infringing technologies would increase our costs.17A deterioration in future expected profitability or cash flows could result in an impairment of our recorded goodwill.Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently when impairment indicators arise. A lower fair value estimate in the future for any of our reporting units could result in goodwill impairments. Factors that could trigger a lower fair value estimate include changes in customer demand, cost increases, regulatory or political environment changes, and other changes in market conditions, such as decreased prices in similar market-based transactions, which could impact future earnings of the reporting unit.At December 31, 2014, recorded goodwill of $75.8 million was associated with our completion services reporting unit. The recent decline in crude oil prices has introduced some uncertainty associated with certain key assumptions used in estimating fair value of the reporting unit. Depressed crude oil prices for a prolonged period of time may adversely affect the economics of certain of our customers’ projects, particularly for shale-related projects in North America, and may reduce the demand for completion services, negatively impacting the financial results of the reporting unit. Management is monitoring the overall market, specifically crude oil prices, and its effect on the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test for completion services, which may require re-evaluation and could result in an impairment of goodwill for this reporting unit.At December 31, 2014, recorded goodwill of $30.7 million was associated with our automation and control reporting unit. During 2014 the automation and control reporting unit realized significantly lower sales volumes, leading to negative operating results for the year and creating some uncertainty regarding future demand for certain products. Management has undertaken efforts to integrate the reporting unit’s UCOS® product with our Master Control Station in our subsea systems business to promote cost and efficiency savings in our subsea product offering by utilizing the UCOS® Master Control Station as the standard for control system applications in subsea production, processing and workover systems. Management is evaluating the realizability of these savings and its effect on the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test for automation and control, which may require re-evaluation and could result in an impairment of goodwill for this reporting unit.A downgrade in the rating of our debt could restrict our ability to access the capital markets.Changes in the ratings assigned to our debt may impact our access to the debt capital markets. If ratings for our debt fall below investment grade, our access to the debt capital markets could become restricted. Moreover, our revolving credit agreement includes an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. An increase in the level of our indebtedness and related interest costs may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing.ITEM 1B
