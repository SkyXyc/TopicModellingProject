    Employees


 


    As of December 31, 2009, the Company and its consolidated
    subsidiaries had approximately 12,500 salaried and hourly
    employees (as compared with approximately 13,800 employees
    at December 31, 2008), of which approximately 4,100 were
    U.S. employees. The approximately 13,800 employees at
    December 31, 2008 included anticipated reductions, which
    did occur in 2009. Refer to Note 17,
    “Restructuring” of the Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for a
    discussion of actions taken in 2009. Approximately 19% of the
    Company’s U.S. workforce is unionized. The hourly
    employees at certain of our international facilities are also
    unionized. The Company believes its present relations with
    employees to be satisfactory.


 


    Our only domestic collective bargaining agreement is for our
    Ithaca and Cortland, New York facilities. This agreement expires
    in September 2012.


 



    Raw
    Materials


 


    The company uses a variety of raw materials in the production of
    its automotive products including steel, aluminum, copper,
    plastic resins, and certain alloying elements. Manufacturing
    operations for each of the Company’s operating segments are
    dependent upon natural gas, fuel oil, and electricity.


 


    Commodity prices dropped sharply in 2009 due to falling global
    demands and their subsequent oversupply. Commodity prices have
    recovered much of their value and have returned to 2007 levels
    after bottoming out during the recession of 2009.


 


    As developed economies recover and auto production accelerates,
    certain commodities may experience temporary shortages and
    inflated prices until production volumes again reach equilibrium
    with market demands. The Company uses a variety of tactics in
    order to limit the impact of supply shortages and inflationary
    pressures.


 


    The Company formed a global procurement organization to
    accelerate: cost reductions, purchases from lower cost regions,
    supplier rationalization, risk mitigation efforts, and
    collaborative buying activities. In addition, the Company uses
    long-term contracts, cost sharing arrangements, design changes,
    customer buy programs, and limited financial instruments to help
    control costs. The Company intends to use similar measures in
    2010 and beyond. Refer to Note 10, “Financial
    Instruments” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this report for information related
    to the Company’s hedging activities.


 


    For 2010, the Company believes that its supplies of raw
    materials and energy are adequate and available from multiple
    sources to support its manufacturing requirements.


 



    Environmental
    Regulation and Proceedings


 


    The Company and certain of its current and former direct and
    indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have
    been identified by the United States Environmental Protection
    Agency and certain state environmental agencies and private
    parties as potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) at
    various hazardous waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive
    Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
    (“Superfund”) and equivalent state laws and, as such,
    may presently be liable for the cost of
    clean-up and
    other remedial activities at 35 such sites. Responsibility for
    clean-up and
    other remedial activities at a Superfund site is typically
    shared among PRPs based on an allocation formula.


 


    The Company believes that none of these matters, individually or
    in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its
    results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
    Generally, this is because either the estimates of the maximum
    potential liability at a site are not large or the liability
    will be shared with other PRPs, although no assurance can be
    given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter.


 


    Based on information available to the Company (which in most
    cases includes: an estimate of allocation of liability among
    PRPs; the probability that other PRPs, many of whom are large,
    solvent public companies, will fully pay the cost apportioned to
    them; currently available information from PRPs
    and/or
    federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of
    contamination and estimated remediation and consulting

    costs; remediation alternatives; and estimated legal fees), the
    Company has an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities
    with a balance at December 31, 2009 of $21.0 million.
    The Company has accrued amounts that do not exceed
    $3.0 million related to any individual site except for the
    Crystal Springs site discussed below, and we do not believe that
    the costs related to any of these sites will have a material
    adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash
    flows or financial condition. The Company expects to pay out
    substantially all of the amounts accrued for environmental
    liability over the next three to five years.


 


    In connection with the sale of Kuhlman Electric Corporation, the
    Company agreed to indemnify the buyer and Kuhlman Electric for
    certain environmental liabilities, then unknown to the Company,
    relating to certain operations of Kuhlman Electric that pre-date
    the Company’s 1999 acquisition of Kuhlman Electric. During
    2000, Kuhlman Electric notified the Company that it discovered
    potential environmental contamination at its Crystal Springs,
    Mississippi plant while undertaking an expansion of the plant.
    The Company is continuing to work with the Mississippi
    Department of Environmental Quality and Kuhlman Electric to
    investigate and remediate to the extent necessary, historical
    contamination at the plant and surrounding area. Kuhlman
    Electric and others, including the Company, were sued in
    numerous related lawsuits, in which multiple claimants alleged
    personal injury and property damage relating to the alleged
    environmental contamination. In 2005, the Company and other
    defendants entered into settlements that resolved approximately
    99% of those claims and the remainder of them have since been
    dismissed.


 


    In 2007 and 2008, four additional lawsuits were filed against
    Kuhlman Electric and others, including the Company, on behalf of
    approximately 340 plaintiffs, alleging personal injury relating
    to the alleged environmental contamination. At this stage of the
    litigation, the Company cannot make any predictions as to the
    outcome, but it is vigorously defending against the suits.


 



    Conditional Asset
    Retirement Obligations


 


    In March 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Codification
    (“ASC”) Topic 410, Accounting for Conditional Asset
    Retirement Obligations, which requires the Company to recognize
    legal obligations to perform asset retirements in which the
    timing
    and/or
    method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may
    or may not be within the control of the entity. Certain
    government regulations require the removal and disposal of
    asbestos from an existing facility at the time the facility
    undergoes major renovations or is demolished. The liability
    exists because the facility will not last forever, but it is
    conditional on future renovations (even if there are no
    immediate plans to remove the materials, which pose no health or
    safety hazard in their current condition). Similarly, government
    regulations require the removal or closure of underground
    storage tanks and above ground storage tanks when their use
    ceases, the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyl transformers
    and capacitors when their use ceases, and the disposal of used
    furnace bricks and liners, and lead-based paint in conjunction
    with facility renovations or demolition. The Company currently
    has 31 manufacturing locations that have been identified as
    containing these items. The fair value to remove and dispose of
    this material has been estimated and recorded at
    $1.3 million as of December 31, 2009 and
    $1.4 million as of December 31, 2008.

    Item 1A. 

    
    Risk
    Factors





 


    The following risk factors and other information included in
    this Annual Report on
    Form 10-K
    should be considered. The risks and uncertainties described
    below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and
    uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently
    deem immaterial also may impact our business operations. If any
    of the following risks occur, our business including its
    financial performance, financial condition, operating results
    and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.


 



    Our industry
    is cyclical and our results of operations will be adversely
    affected by industry downturns.


 


    Automotive and truck production and sales are cyclical and
    sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors
    including interest rates, consumer credit, and consumer spending
    and preferences. Further economic decline that results in
    further significant reduction in automotive or truck production
    would have a material adverse effect on our sales to original
    equipment manufacturers.


 


    We continue to take steps to realign and resize our production
    capacity and cost structure to meet current and projected
    operational and market requirements. Further significant
    declines in the automotive industry and financial declines and
    restructurings by our significant customers may make it
    necessary to take further restructuring actions and charges.


 



    We are
    dependent on market segments that use our key products and would
    be affected by decreasing demand in those
    segments.


 


    Some of our products, in particular turbochargers, are currently
    used primarily in diesel passenger cars and commercial vehicles.
    Any significant reduction in production in these market segments
    or loss of business in these market segments could have a
    material adverse effect on our sales to original equipment
    manufacturers.


 



    We face strong
    competition.


 


    We compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and
    distributors that produce and sell products similar to ours.
    Price, quality, delivery, technological innovation, application
    engineering development and program launch support are the
    primary elements of competition. Our competitors include
    vertically integrated units of our major original equipment
    manufacturer customers, as well as a large number of independent
    domestic and international suppliers. We are not as large as a
    number of these companies and do not have as many financial or
    other resources. The competitive environment has changed
    dramatically over the past few years as our traditional
    U.S. original equipment manufacturer customers, faced with
    intense international competition, have expanded their worldwide
    sourcing of components. As a result, we have experienced
    competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that
    enjoy economic advantages, such as





    
    14



Table of Contents





    lower labor costs, lower health care costs and, in some cases,
    export or raw materials subsidies. Increased competition could
    adversely affect our businesses.


 



    We are under
    substantial pressure from original equipment manufacturers to
    reduce the prices of our products.


 


    There is substantial and continuing pressure on original
    equipment manufacturers to reduce costs, including costs of
    products we supply. Although original equipment manufacturers
    have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside
    suppliers, a number of our major original equipment manufacturer
    customers manufacture products for their own uses that directly
    compete with our products. These original equipment
    manufacturers could elect to manufacture such products for their
    own uses in place of the products we currently supply. We
    believe that our ability to develop proprietary new products and
    to control our costs will allow us to remain competitive.
    However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to improve or
    maintain our gross margins on product sales to original
    equipment manufacturers or that the recent trend by original
    equipment manufacturers towards increased outsourcing will
    continue.


 


    Annual price reductions to original equipment manufacturer
    customers appear to have become a permanent feature of our
    business environment. To maintain our profit margins, we seek
    price reductions from our suppliers, improve production
    processes to increase manufacturing efficiency, update product
    designs to reduce costs and develop new products, the benefits
    of which support stable or increased prices. Our ability to pass
    through increased raw material costs to our original equipment
    manufacturer customers is limited, with cost recovery often less
    than 100% and often on a delayed basis. We cannot assure you
    that we will be able to reduce costs in an amount equal to
    annual price reductions and increases in raw material costs.


 



    We are
    sensitive to the effects of our major customers’ labor
    relations.


 


    All three of our primary North American customers, Ford,
    Chrysler and General Motors, have major union contracts with the
    United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers
    of America. Because of domestic original equipment
    manufacturers’ dependence on a single union, we are
    affected by labor difficulties and work stoppages at original
    equipment manufacturers’ facilities. Similarly, a majority
    of our global customers’ operations outside of North
    America are also represented by various unions. Any extended
    work stoppage could have an adverse effect on our business.


 



    Part of our
    labor force is unionized which could subject us to work
    stoppages.


 


    As of December 31, 2009, approximately 19% of our
    U.S. workforce was unionized. Our only domestic collective
    bargaining agreement is for our Ithaca and Cortland, New York
    facilities. This agreement expires in September 2012. The hourly
    employees at certain of our international facilities are also
    unionized. While we believe that our relations with our
    employees are satisfactory, a prolonged dispute with our
    employees could have an adverse effect on our business.


 



    We are subject
    to extensive environmental regulations.


 


    Our operations are subject to laws governing, among other
    things, emissions to air, discharges to waters and the
    generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and
    disposal of waste and other materials. We believe that our
    business, operations and activities have been and are being
    operated in compliance in all material respects with applicable
    environmental, health and safety laws. However, the operation of
    automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in these
    areas, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur material
    costs or liabilities as a result. Furthermore, through various
    acquisitions over the years, we have acquired a number of
    manufacturing facilities, and we cannot assure you that we will
    not incur materials costs and liabilities relating to activities
    that predate our ownership. In addition, potentially significant
    expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving
    environmental, health and safety laws that may be adopted in the
    future.




    
    15



Table of Contents






    We have
    contingent liabilities related to environmental, product
    warranties, regulatory matters, litigation and other
    claims.


 


    We and certain of our current and former direct and indirect
    corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have been
    identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency
    and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as
    potentially responsible parties at various hazardous waste
    disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
    Compensation and Liability Act and equivalent state laws. As a
    result, as of December 31, 2009, we may be liable for the
    cost of
    clean-up and
    other remedial activities at 35 of these sites.


 


    We work with outside experts to determine a range of potential
    liability for environmental sites. The ranges for each
    individual site are then aggregated into a loss range for the
    total accrued liability. Management’s estimate of the loss
    range for environmental liability, including conditional asset
    retirement obligations, for 2009 is between approximately
    $20 million and $40 million. We record an accrual at
    the most probable amount within the range unless one cannot be
    determined; in which case we record the accrual at the low end
    of the range. Based on information available to us, we have
    established an accrual in our financial statements for indicated
    environmental liabilities, including our conditional asset
    retirement obligation under ASC Topic 410, with a balance of
    $1.3 million at December 31, 2009. We currently expect
    the substantial portion of this amount to be expended over the
    next three to five years.


 


    We provide warranties to our customers for some of our products.
    Under these warranties, we may be required to bear costs and
    expenses for the repair or replacement of these products. We
    cannot assure you that costs and expenses associated with these
    product warranties will not be material, or that those costs
    will not exceed any amounts accrued for such warranties in our
    financial statement. Based upon information available to us, we
    have established an accrual in our financial statements for
    product warranties of $61.7 million at December 31,
    2009.


 


    We are also party to, or have an obligation to defend a party
    to, various legal proceedings, including those described in
    Note 14 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements in the Company’s Annual Report on
    Form 10-K.


 


    We are currently, and may in the future become, subject to legal
    proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes. These claims
    typically arise in the normal course of business and may
    include, but not be limited to, commercial or contractual
    disputes with our suppliers, intellectual property matters and
    employment claims. There is a possibility that such claims may
    have an adverse impact on our business that is greater than we
    anticipate.


 



    Our growth
    strategy may prove unsuccessful.


 


    We have a stated goal of increasing revenues and operating
    income at a rate greater than global vehicle production by
    increasing content per vehicle with innovative new components
    and through select acquisitions. We may not meet our goal
    because of any of the following: (a) the failure to develop
    new products which will be purchased by our customers;
    (b) technology changes rendering our products obsolete;
    (c) a reversal of the trend of supplying systems (which
    allows us to increase content per vehicle) instead of
    components; and (d) the failure to find suitable
    acquisition targets or the failure to integrate operations of
    acquired businesses quickly and cost effectively.


 



    We are subject
    to risks related to our international operations.


 


    We have manufacturing and technical facilities in many regions
    and countries, including North America, Europe, China, India,
    South Korea, Japan, and Brazil and sell our products worldwide.
    For 2009, approximately 72% of our sales were outside North
    America. Consequently, our results could be affected by changes
    in trade, monetary and fiscal policies, trade restrictions or
    prohibitions, import or other charges or taxes, and fluctuations
    in foreign currency exchange rates, limitations on the
    repatriation of funds changing economic conditions, social
    unrest, political instability and disputes, and international
    terrorism. Compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting
    laws and regulations of various countries is burdensome and





    
    16



Table of Contents





    expensive. See Note 19, “Reporting Segments and
    Related Information” to Consolidated Financial Statements
    in the Company’s Annual Report on
    Form 10-K,
    regarding the size of our international operations.


 



    We may not
    realize sales represented by awarded business.


 


    We base our growth projections, in part, on commitments made by
    our customers. These commitments generally renew yearly during a
    program life cycle. If actual production orders from our
    customers do not approximate such commitments, it could
    adversely affect our business.


 



    We are
    impacted by the rising cost of providing pension and other post
    employment benefits.


 


    The automotive industry, like other industries, continues to be
    impacted by the rising cost of providing pension and other post
    employment benefits. To partially address this impact, we
    continue to make adjustments to certain retiree medical and
    pension plans. See Note 11, “Retirement Benefit
    Plans” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the
    Company’s Annual Report on
    Form 10-K.


 



    Certain
    defined benefit pension plans we sponsor are currently
    underfunded.


 


    We sponsor certain defined benefit pension plans worldwide that
    are underfunded and will require cash payments. Additionally, if
    the performance of the assets in our pension plans does not meet
    our expectations, or if other actuarial assumptions are
    modified, our required contributions may be higher than we
    expect. See Note 11, “Retirement Benefit Plans”
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company’s
    Annual Report on
    Form 10-K.


 



    Negative or
    unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our
    business.


 


    Adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial
    outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to
    changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets
    and other tax accruals that could adversely affect our financial
    performance.


 


    Additionally, we are subject to tax audits by governmental
    authorities in the U.S. and numerous
    non-U.S. jurisdictions.
    Because the results of tax audits are inherently uncertain,
    negative or unexpected results from one or more such tax audits
    could adversely affect our business.


 



    We rely on
    sales to major customers.


 


    We rely on sales to original equipment manufacturers around the
    world. Supply to several of these customers requires significant
    investment by the Company in working capital, plant and
    equipment. Some of our customers are rated by the credit rating
    agencies as below investment grade. The loss of sales to a major
    customer, due to any of a variety of factors including
    non-renewal of purchase orders, the customer’s financial
    hardship or other unforeseen reasons, could adversely affect our
    business.


 


    Furthermore, some of our sales are concentrated. Our worldwide
    sales in 2009 to Volkswagen and Ford constituted approximately
    22% and 12%, respectively, of our 2009 consolidated sales.


 



    Suppliers’
    economic distress could result in the disruption of our
    operations and have a material effect on our
    business.


 


    Unfavorable industry conditions such as lower production
    volumes; credit tightness; changes in foreign currencies; raw
    material, commodity, transportation, and energy price
    escalation; drastic changes in consumer preferences; and others
    could adversely affect our supply chain, and sometimes with
    little advanced notice. These conditions could also result in
    increased commercial disputes and supply interruption risks. In
    certain instances, it would be difficult and expensive for us to
    change suppliers that are critical to our business. On occasion,
    we must provide financial support to distressed suppliers or
    take other measures to protect our supply lines. While we have
    taken definite actions to mitigate these factors, we can not
    predict with certainty the potential adverse effects these costs
    might have on our business.

    We continue to
    face highly volatile commodity costs used in the production of
    our products.


 


    The Company uses a variety of commodities (including steel,
    nickel, copper, aluminum, plastic resins, other raw materials
    and energy) and materials purchased in various forms such as
    castings, powder metal, forgings, stampings, and bar stock.
    Increasing commodity costs will have an impact on our results.
    We have sought to alleviate the impact of increasing costs by
    including a material pass-through provision in our customer
    contracts wherever possible or by selectively hedging certain
    commodity exposures. Customers frequently challenge these
    contractual provisions and rarely pay the full cost of any
    materials increases. The discontinuation of being able to
    pass-through or hedge increasing commodity costs would adversely
    affect our business.


 


    From time to time, commodity prices may also fall rapidly. When
    this happens, suppliers may withdraw capacity from the market
    until prices improve which may cause periodic supply
    interruptions. The same may be true of our transportation
    carriers and energy providers.


 



    We could be
    adversely affected by supply shortages of components from our
    suppliers.


 


    In an effort to manage and reduce the cost of purchased goods
    and services, we have been rationalizing our supply base. As a
    result, we are dependent on fewer sources of supply for certain
    components used in the manufacture of our products. The Company
    selects suppliers based on total value (including total landed
    price, quality, delivery, and technology), taking into
    consideration their production capacities and financial
    condition. We expect that they will deliver to our stated
    written expectations.


 


    However, there can be no assurance that capacity limitations,
    labor unrest, weather emergencies, commercial disputes,
    government actions, riots, wars, sabotage, non-conforming parts,
    acts of terrorism, “Acts of God”, or other problems
    experienced by our suppliers will not result in occasional
    shortages or delays in their supply of components to us. If we
    were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of
    critical components from any of our suppliers and could not
    procure the components from other sources, we would be unable to
    meet the production schedules for some of our key products and
    could miss customer delivery expectations. This would adversely
    affect our customer relations and business.


 



    A downgrade in
    the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the
    debt capital markets.


 


    Changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt
    may ultimately impact our access to the debt capital markets and
    the costs we incur to borrow funds. If ratings for our debt fall
    below investment grade, our access to the debt capital markets
    would become restricted.


 


    Additionally, our revolving credit agreement includes an
    increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are
    downgraded. Further, an increase in the level of our
    indebtedness and related interest costs may increase our
    vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry
    conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional
    financing.


 



    Conditions in
    the automotive industry may adversely affect our
    business.


 


    Our financial performance depends on conditions in the global
    automotive industry. Original equipment manufactures have
    experienced difficulties from a weakened economy and tightened
    credit markets. If our customers reduce their orders to us, it
    would adversely affect our results of operations. A prolonged
    downturn in the automotive industry or a significant product mix
    shift due to consumer demand could require us to shut down
    plants or incur impairment charges. Continued uncertainty
    relating to the financial condition of automakers would have a
    negative impact on our business.


 



    We are subject
    to possible insolvency of financial
    counterparties.


 


    The Company engages in numerous financial transactions and
    contracts including insurance policies, letters of credit,
    credit line agreements, financial derivatives, and investment
    management agreements involving various counterparties. The
    Company is subject to the risk that one or more of these
    counterparties may become insolvent and therefore be unable to
    discharge its obligations under such contracts.

    We are subject
    to possible insolvency of outsourced service
    providers.


 


    The Company relies on third party service providers for
    administration of workers’ compensation claims, health care
    benefits, pension benefits, stockholder and bondholder
    registration and similar services. These service providers
    contribute to the efficient conduct of the Company’s
    business, so the Company could be adversely affected in the
    event of insolvency of one or more of these service providers.


 



    A variety of
    other factors could adversely affect our business.


 


    Any of the following could materially and adversely affect our
    business: the loss of or changes in supply contracts or sourcing
    strategies of our major customers or suppliers;
    start — up expenses associated with new vehicle
    programs or delays or cancellation of such programs,
    underutilization of our manufacturing facilities, which can be
    dependent on a single product line or customer; inability to
    recover engineering and tooling costs; market and financial
    consequences of recalls that may be required on products we
    supplied; delays or difficulties in new product development; the
    possible introduction of similar or superior technologies by
    others; and global excess capacity and vehicle platform
    proliferation.
