General
 
Whole Foods Market is the world’s leading retailer of natural and organic foods and America’s first national “Certified Organic” grocer. Unless otherwise specified, references to “Whole Foods Market,” “Company,” or “We” in this Report include the Company and its consolidated, wholly owned subsidiaries. The Company was formed in 1980 and is based in Austin, Texas. We completed our initial public offering in January 1992, and our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “WFM.” Our Company mission is to promote the vitality and well-being of all individuals by supplying the highest quality, most wholesome foods available. Since the purity of our food and the health of our bodies are directly related to the purity and health of our environment, our core mission is devoted to the promotion of organically grown foods, healthy eating, and the sustainability of our entire ecosystem. Through our growth, we have had a significant and positive impact on the natural and organic foods movement throughout the United States, helping lead the industry to nationwide acceptance over the last 31 years.
 
We have one operating segment, natural and organic foods supermarkets. We are the largest retailer of natural and organic foods in the U.S. and the 10th largest food retailer overall based on 2010 sales rankings from Progressive Grocer. As of September 25, 2011, we operated 311 stores in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Our stores average 38,000 square feet in size and 10 years in age, and are supported by our Austin headquarters, regional offices, distribution centers, bakehouse facilities, commissary kitchens, seafood-processing facilities, meat and produce procurement centers, and a specialty coffee, tea procurement and roasting operation.

Industry Overview
 
According to Nielsen TDLinx and Progressive Grocer, the U.S. grocery industry, which includes conventional supermarkets, supercenters, limited-assortment and natural/gourmet-positioned supermarkets, had approximately $563 billion in sales in 2010, a 1% increase over the prior year. Within this broader category, natural product sales through retail channels were approximately $65 billion, a 7% increase over the prior year, according to Natural Foods Merchandiser, a leading trade publication for the natural foods industry. We believe the growth in sales of natural and organic foods is being driven by numerous factors, including:
 
·                  heightened awareness of the role that healthy eating plays in long-term wellness;
·                  a better-educated and wealthier populace whose median age is increasing each year;
·                  increasing consumer concern over the purity and safety of food; and
·                  environmental concerns.
 
Our Core Values
 
We believe that much of our success to date is because we remain a uniquely mission-driven company. Our core values succinctly express the purpose of our business, which is not only to make profits but to create value for all of our major

stakeholders, each of which is linked interdependently. By maintaining our core values, regardless of how large we become, we are able to preserve what has always been special about our Company.
 
Our core values are:
 
·                  Selling the highest quality natural and organic products available;
·                  Satisfying and delighting our customers;
·                  Supporting team member happiness and excellence;
·                  Creating wealth through profits and growth;
·                  Caring about our communities and our environment;
·                  Creating ongoing win-win partnerships with our suppliers; and
·                  Promoting the health of our stakeholders through healthy eating education.
 
Differentiated Product Offering
 
We offer a broad and differentiated selection of high-quality natural and organic products with a strong emphasis on perishable foods. Our product selection includes, but is not limited to: produce, seafood, grocery, meat and poultry, bakery, prepared foods and catering, specialty (beer, wine and cheese), coffee and tea, nutritional supplements, vitamins, body care, educational products such as books, floral items, pet products and household products. We estimate our stores carry on average approximately 21,000 SKUs.

Natural foods can be defined as foods that are minimally processed, largely or completely free of artificial ingredients, preservatives and other non-naturally occurring chemicals and as near to their whole, natural state as possible. Organic foods are grown through methods intended to support and enhance the earth’s natural balance. Under the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (“USDA”) Organic Rule, implemented into federal law in 2002, all products labeled as “organic” in any form must be certified by a USDA-accredited certifying agency. Furthermore, all retailers, including Whole Foods Market, that handle, store and sell organic products must implement measures to protect their organic integrity. Generally, organic food products are produced using:
 
·                  agricultural management practices intended to promote and enhance ecosystem health;
·                  no genetically engineered seeds or crops, sewage sludge, long-lasting pesticides, herbicides or fungicides;
·                  livestock management practices intended to promote healthy, humanely treated animals by providing organically grown feed, fresh air and outdoor access while using no antibiotics or growth hormones; and
·                  food-processing practices intended to protect the integrity of the organic product and disallow irradiation, genetically modified organisms (“GMOs”) or synthetic preservatives.
 
Our Quality Standards
 
We aspire to become an international brand synonymous with not just natural and organic foods, but also with being the highest quality food retailer in every community in which we are located. We believe our strict quality standards differentiate our stores from other supermarkets and enable us to attract and maintain a broad base of loyal customers.
 
·                  We carefully evaluate each and every product we sell.
·                  We feature foods that are free of artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, sweeteners and hydrogenated fats.
·                  We are passionate about great tasting food and the pleasure of sharing it with others.
·                  We are committed to foods that are fresh, wholesome and safe to eat.
·                  We seek out and promote organically grown foods.
·                  We provide food and nutritional products that support health and well-being.
 
Store Brands
 
Our nationally driven store brands currently feature approximately 2,600 SKUs led by our primary brand, 365 Everyday Value®, along with a grouping of “exclusive” and “control brand” products. While some of our store brands yield greater margins than their national brand alternative, their primary purpose is to help differentiate our product selection and provide

Table of Contents
 
more value offerings to our customers. In addition to our nationally driven programs, we have a number of store-made and regionally made fresh items sold under the Whole Foods Market label, and we offer specialty and organic coffee, tea and drinking chocolates through our Allegro Coffee Company subsidiary. Total sales of store-branded products across all categories were approximately 11% of our retail sales for both fiscal years 2011 and 2010.
 
Value Programs
 
We continue to evaluate and strengthen our value offerings, providing a clear range of choices in every category, and we believe our focus in this area has played a key role in driving our sales growth. In addition to supporting our 365 Everyday Value brand, we have lowered prices on thousands of known value items, extended value choices to our perishables departments, promoted our regional “Madness Sales,” and focused on stronger customer education. We also have continued our national The Whole Deal campaign, launched in fiscal year 2008, which includes our printed value guide available in all U.S. stores.
 
Health Starts Here®
 
We are offering an increasing selection of Health Starts Here products in our stores. Health Starts Here is a mindful approach to healthy eating rooted in four simple ways to build better meals — Whole Food, Plant-StrongTM, Healthy Fats, and Nutrient Dense. Products such as frozen items, breads and prepared foods that meet these guidelines carry our “Health Starts Here” logo. In addition, all of our stores feature signage on the Aggregate Nutrient Density Index (“ANDI®”), a proprietary scoring system that ranks foods based on nutrient density (vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals and antioxidants) per calorie.
 
Whole Trade® Guarantee
 
Whole Trade products sourced from developing countries meet our high quality standards, provide more money to producers, ensure better wages and working conditions for workers, and utilize sound environmental practices. Demand for our Whole Trade Guarantee products continues to grow. We currently offer over 1,500 items, with sales increasing 28% year over year to approximately $146.3 million in fiscal year 2011. Whole Foods Market donates 1% of sales of exclusive Whole Trade products to the Whole Planet Foundation® to help alleviate world poverty.
 
Locally Grown
 
We are committed to buying from local producers whose products meet our high quality standards, particularly those who are dedicated to environmentally friendly, sustainable agriculture. Whole Foods Market currently purchases produce from over 2,000 different farms through various suppliers. In fiscal year 2007, we established a budget of up to $10 million to promote local food production, and as of September 25, 2011, we had disbursed more than $5.5 million in loans to 97 local producers company-wide.
 
Animal Welfare
 
We are dedicated to promoting animal welfare on farms and ranches that raise animals for meat production, helping to create alternatives to the “factory farm” methods of raising livestock. We have encouraged innovative animal production practices to improve the quality and safety of the meat and poultry sold in our stores while also supporting humane living conditions for the animals. Work on our “animal compassionate” standards started in 2003, and additional standards development and implementation of a 5-StepTM Animal Welfare Rating system transitioned to the Global Animal Partnership foundation in 2008. Global Animal Partnership’s 5-Step Animal Welfare Rating standards have been developed for beef cattle, pigs and broiler chickens and are in the works for other species as well. As of February 2011, our meat departments in all U.S. stores reflect these certifications.
 
Seafood Sustainability
 
In September 2010, we completed the launch of a color-coded, science-based seafood sustainability ratings program developed by partnering organizations, Blue Ocean Institute and Monterey Bay Aquarium. The program provides customers with the information they need to make informed decisions about their seafood purchases by rating non-Marine Stewardship Council (“MSC”) certified wild-caught seafood based on key criteria for sustainable fisheries with solid, transparent ranking methods. With our promise to phase out all “red-rated” species by Earth Day 2012, we have deepened our commitment to having fully sustainable seafood departments. This new seafood ratings program builds upon our ongoing partnership with the MSC and complements Whole Foods Market’s existing farmed seafood standards, which remain the highest in the industry. Farmed seafood at Whole Foods Market carries the “Responsibly Farmed” logo to indicate that it meets these high standards.
 
Eco-ScaleTM
 
Currently, there are no government regulations requiring full disclosure of ingredients on cleaning products, so in April 2011, we introduced our Eco-Scale™ Rating System — an industry-first set of tiered, green household standards — to help customers make more informed choices for their homes and the planet. Under our new Eco-Scale Rating System, all household cleaning products in our stores will list full ingredients on their packaging. This comprehensive, color-coded rating system will allow shoppers to easily identify a product’s environmental impact and safety based on a red-orange-yellow-green color scale. We

are committed to working with our vendors to evaluate and independently audit every product in our cleaning category, and all products in our stores will be required to meet our baseline orange standard by Earth Day, April 2012.
 
Seasonality
 
The Company’s average weekly sales and gross profit are typically highest in the second and third fiscal quarters and lowest in the fourth fiscal quarter. Average weekly sales and gross profit are typically lower in the first fiscal quarter due to the product mix of holiday sales, and in the fourth fiscal quarter due to the seasonally slower sales during the summer months.
 
Growth Strategy
 
We are a Fortune 500 company, ranking number 273 on the 2011 list. Our sales have grown rapidly due to historically strong identical store sales growth, acquisitions and new store openings from approximately $92.5 million in fiscal year 1991, excluding the effect of pooling-of-interests transactions completed since 1991, to approximately $10.11 billion in fiscal year 2011, a 20-year compounded annual growth rate of approximately 26%.
 
Over the last 10 fiscal years, our identical store sales growth has averaged approximately 7%. This growth was driven by an average 4% increase in transaction count and an average 3% increase in basket size, a mix of approximately 60% transaction count to 40% basket size. Our identical store sales growth for each of the last 10 fiscal years is shown in the following chart:
 

 
Approximately 18% of our existing square footage was acquired, and while we may continue to pursue acquisitions of smaller chains that provide access to desirable geographic areas and experienced team members, such acquisitions are not expected to significantly impact our future store growth or financial results. Our growth strategy is to expand primarily through new store openings. We have a disciplined, opportunistic real estate strategy, opening stores in existing trade areas as well as new areas, including international locations. We typically target stores located on premium real estate sites, and while we may open stores as small as 15,000 square feet or as large as 75,000 square feet, the majority of our new stores are expected to fall in the range of 35,000 to 45,000 square feet going forward.

We remain focused on the right-sized store for each market. In response to the 2008-2009 recession, we trimmed approximately 1.4 million square feet from our development pipeline, downsizing 20 leases for stores in development and terminating an additional 22 leases. We now are rebuilding the pipeline, and we expect a higher number of store openings in fiscal year 2012. Our historical store development pipeline is summarized below:

Store Description
 
Each of our stores is designed to fit the size and configuration of the particular location and to reflect the community in which it is located. We strive to transform food shopping from a chore into a dynamic experience by building and operating stores with a lively, inspirational atmosphere, mission-oriented décor, well-trained team members, an exciting product mix that emphasizes healthy eating and our high quality standards, ever-changing selections, samples, open kitchens, scratch bakeries, hand-stacked produce, and prepared foods stations. We also incorporate many environmentally sustainable aspects into our store design. Our stores typically include sit-down eating areas, customer comment boards and customer service booths. In addition, some stores offer special services such as massage, valet parking, Wellness Centers, personal shopping and home delivery. We believe our stores play a unique role as a third place, besides the home and office, where people can gather, interact and learn while at the same time discovering the many joys of eating and sharing food.
 
Most of our stores are located in high-traffic shopping areas on premier real estate sites and are either freestanding or in strip centers. We also have a number of urban stores located in high-density, mixed-use developments. In selecting store locations, we use an internally developed model to analyze potential sites based on various criteria such as education levels, population density and income levels within certain drive times. After we have selected a target site, our development group does a comprehensive site study and sales projection and works with our regional teams to develop construction and operating cost estimates. Each project must meet an internal Economic Value Added (“EVA®”) hurdle return, based on our internal weighted-average cost of capital, which for new stores generally is expected to be cumulative positive EVA in five years or less. In its simplest definition, EVA is equivalent to net operating profits after taxes minus a charge on the cost of invested capital necessary to generate those profits. In March 2011, we lowered our internal weighted-average cost of capital metric to 8% from 9% to reflect our current financial structure.
 
The required cash investment for new stores varies depending on the size of the store, geographic location, degree of work performed by the landlord and complexity of site development issues. To a significant degree, it also depends on how the project is structured, including costs for elements that often increase or decrease rent, e.g., lease acquisition costs, shell and/or garage costs, and landlord allowances. Because of these differences, the average cost per square foot may vary significantly from project to project and from year to year.

Purchasing and Distribution
 
The majority of our purchasing, particularly in dry grocery, occurs at the regional and national levels, enabling us to negotiate better volume discounts with major vendors and distributors while allowing our store buyers to focus on local products and the unique product mix necessary to keep the neighborhood market feel in our stores. We are increasingly focusing more of our purchasing on producer-direct and manufacturer-direct programs, and we remain committed to buying from local producers that meet our high quality standards.
 
We own two produce procurement centers which facilitate the procurement and distribution of the majority of the produce we sell. We also operate four seafood processing and distribution facilities, a specialty coffee and tea procurement and roasting operation, and 10 regional distribution centers that focus primarily on perishables distribution to our stores across the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom. In addition, we have five regional commissary kitchens and seven bakehouse facilities, all of which distribute products to our stores. Other products are typically procured through a combination of specialty wholesalers and direct distributors.
 
United Natural Foods, Inc. (“UNFI”) is our single largest third-party supplier, accounting for approximately 31% of our total purchases in fiscal year 2011. In June 2010, we extended our long-term relationship with UNFI as our primary supplier of dry grocery and frozen food products through 2020. Beginning in fiscal year 2011, UNFI also became our primary non-perishables distributor in two additional regions, allowing us to focus our internal distribution efforts in our regions around key perishables departments.
 
Store Operations
 
We strive to promote a strong company culture featuring a team approach to store operations that we believe is distinctly more empowering of team members than that of the traditional supermarket. Our domestic Whole Foods Market stores each employ between approximately 45 and 665 team members who generally comprise 10 self-managed teams per store, each led by a team leader. Each team within a store is responsible for a different product offering or aspect of store operations such as prepared foods, grocery, or customer service, among others. We also promote a decentralized approach to store operations in which many decisions are made by teams at the individual store level. In this structure, an effective store team leader is critical to the success of the store. The store team leader works closely with one or more associate store team leaders, as well as with all of the department team leaders, to operate the store as efficiently and profitably as possible.
 
Team members are involved at all levels of our business. We strive to create a company-wide consciousness of “shared fate” by uniting the interests of team members as closely as possible with those of our shareholders. One way we reinforce this concept is through our Gainsharing program. Under Gainsharing, as part of our annual planning process, each team receives a labor budget expressed as a percentage of their team’s sales, with leverage built into the budgets on an overall company basis. When teams come in under budget due either to higher sales or lower labor costs, a portion of the surplus is divided among the team members and paid out every four weeks, and a portion is set aside in a savings pool. When teams are over budget (or in a labor deficit position), no Gainsharing money is paid out. Instead, the overage is taken out of the team’s savings pool or, in the absence of savings, paid back using future surpluses. The savings pool is paid out annually after the end of the fiscal year to all teams with a positive balance. Rewarding our team members for increases in labor productivity, something they can control, gives them a direct stake in the success of our business. We also encourage stock ownership among team members through our broad-based team member stock option plan, stock purchase plan and 401(k) plan.
 
Team Members
 
As of September 25, 2011, we had approximately 64,200 team members, including approximately 48,200 full-time, 13,300 part-time and 2,700 seasonal team members. Full-time team members accounted for approximately 78% of all permanent positions at the end of fiscal year 2011 compared to 81% at the end of fiscal year 2010. Voluntary turnover of full-time team members was 9% in fiscal years 2011 and 2010, which we believe is very low for the food retailing industry and allows us to better serve our customers. All of our team members are non-union, and we consider our team member relations to be very strong.
 
For the past 14 years, our team members have helped Whole Foods Market become one of FORTUNE magazine’s “100 Best Companies to Work for in America.” Ranking 24th overall and 7th among large companies in 2011, we are one of only 13 companies to make the “100 Best” list every year since its inception.
 
We believe in empowering our team members to make Whole Foods Market not only a great place to shop but a great place to build a career. Our salary and benefits programs reflect our philosophy of egalitarianism. To ensure they are perceived as fundamentally fair to all stakeholders, our books are open to our team members, including our annual individual compensation report. We also have a salary cap that limits the total cash compensation paid to any team member in a calendar year to 19 times the average annual wage, including bonuses, of all team members. In addition, our Co-Founder and Co-Chief

Executive Officer, John Mackey, has voluntarily set his annual salary at $1 and receives no cash bonuses or stock option awards.
 
All of our full-time and part-time team members are eligible to receive stock options through annual leadership grants or through service-hour grants once they have accumulated 6,000 service hours (approximately three years of full-time employment). Approximately 95% of the equity awards granted under the Company’s stock plan since its inception in 1992 have been granted to team members who are not executive officers.
 
Team members are encouraged to take an active role in choosing the benefits made available by the Company by participating in a company-wide benefits vote every three years. Under the current plan voted on by team members, Whole Foods Market provides health care at no cost to full-time team members who work 30 or more hours per week and have worked a minimum of 10,000 service hours. In addition, the Company provides personal wellness dollars in the form of either a health reimbursement arrangement (“HRA”) or, beginning January 1, 2012, a health savings account (“HSA”). Based on service hours, team members receive up to $1,800 per year to help cover the cost of deductibles and other allowable out-of-pocket health care expenses not covered by insurance.
 
Two initiatives developed to support our core value of Promoting the health of our stakeholders through healthy eating education were specifically designed for our team members. They include the Total Health Immersion Program and the Healthy Discount Incentive Program. The Total Health Immersion Program provides educational opportunities for team members that are fully paid by the Company. Since launching this program in the fall of 2009, nearly 1,000 team members have participated, and the program now is open to team member spouses as well, with the Company subsidizing 50% of their cost.
 
The Healthy Discount Incentive Program offers additional store discounts beyond the standard 20% that all team members receive, based on meeting designated biometric criteria (cholesterol/LDL, BMI or waist-height ratio, blood pressure) and being nicotine-free. In fiscal year 2011, approximately 15,000 team members participated in biometric screenings, with nearly 8,300 receiving higher-level discount cards compared to approximately 7,000 team members at the end of fiscal year 2010.
 
Competition
 
Food retailing is a large, intensely competitive industry. Our competition varies across the Company and includes but is not limited to local, regional, national and international conventional and specialty supermarkets, natural foods stores, warehouse membership clubs, smaller specialty stores, farmers’ markets and restaurants, each of which competes with us on the basis of store ambiance and experience, product selection, quality, customer service, price or a combination of these factors. Our commitment to natural and organic products, high quality standards, emphasis on perishable product sales, healthy eating products and education, range of choices based on price, and empowered team members who focus on unparalleled customer service differentiate us from the competition and have created a loyal core customer base. We believe our passionate support of causes and leadership in areas important to our customers reinforce our position as the authentic retailer of natural and organic foods, making us the preferred choice for customers aspiring to a healthier lifestyle.
 
Marketing
 
We spend much less on advertising and marketing than other supermarkets — approximately 0.4% of our total sales in fiscal year 2011. Instead, we rely on word-of-mouth recommendations and testimonials from our shoppers, and we allocate our marketing budgets among national and regional programs and our individual stores. We also connect and engage with our customers through social media websites, in addition to e-newsletters, and our own website and blog at www.wholefoodsmarket.com. Our stores spend most of their marketing budgets on in-store marketing-related activities, including promotional signage and events such as local farmers’ markets, taste fairs, classes, tours and product samplings. We also dedicate resources to The  Whole Deal in-store value guide. Our marketing support mirrors our business model as well as our commitment to the community and environment. Each store retains a separate budget for making contributions to a variety of philanthropic and community activities, fostering goodwill and developing a high profile with the community. Contributions (including in-kind contributions of food) to not-for-profit organizations amount to at least 5% of our after-tax profits annually.
 
The Whole Deal
 
The Whole Deal value guide available in all of our U.S. stores features coupons, budget-conscious recipes and money-saving shopping and cooking tips. Also, we feature Sure Deals which highlight everyday value pricing on high-quality products our customers love. In fiscal year 2011, the average basket containing a coupon from The Whole Deal value guide was $68 and 19 items compared to our overall average basket in identical stores of $34 and eight items.

Social Media
 
Social media provides us with a powerful way to communicate and interact with our customers, giving us insight at both a local and global level as to how we are viewed and what our customers want and expect from us. Currently, we have over 725,000 fans on Facebook and over two million followers on Twitter. In addition, many of our stores have their own Facebook and Twitter accounts.
 
Global Responsibility
 
We seek to be a deeply responsible company in the communities where we do business around the world, providing ethically sourced, high-quality products and transparent information to our customers, reducing our impact on the environment, and actively participating in our local communities. We believe that many customers are concerned about health and nutrition, food safety, fair trade and the environment, and choose to shop our stores for these reasons. Our transparency regarding “farm-to-fork” traceability allows them to make more informed purchasing decisions and “vote” with their dollars.
 
Healthy Eating Education
 
We are providing a revolutionary educational program in our stores to promote the health of our customers and team members. Supported by a team of renowned doctors, researchers and authors who comprise our Scientific and Medical Advisory Board, along with nutritionists, chefs and other experts, our Health Starts Here program consists of a simple approach to eating, paired with practical tools and valuable resources, rooted in our four principles:
 
·                  Whole Food: We believe that food in its purest state — unadulterated by artificial additives, sweeteners, colorings, and preservatives — is the best tasting and most nutritious food available.
·                  Plant-StrongTM: No matter what type of diet you follow — including those with dairy, meat and seafood — reconfigure your plate so the majority of each meal is created from an abundance of raw and cooked vegetables, fruits, legumes and beans, nuts, seeds and whole grains.
·                  Healthy Fats: Get healthy fats from whole plant sources, such as nuts, seeds and avocados. These foods are rich in micronutrients as well. Work to eliminate (or minimize) extracted oils and processed fats.
·                  Nutrient Dense: Choose foods that are rich in micronutrients when compared to their total caloric content. Micro-nutrients include vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and phytochemicals. For guidance, look for the Aggregate Nutrient Density Index (“ANDI”) scoring system in our stores.
 
The program includes, among other things: in-store healthy eating centers to display books and answer questions about healthy eating and cooking ideas; store tours focused on making healthy eating choices; and a wide variety of educational opportunities for team members, along with healthy eating classes and networking opportunities for our customers. We believe our Health Starts Here program will grow and evolve over time to become a key competitive advantage for us, and by offering an informed approach to food as a source for improved health and vitality, we hope to play a big part in the solution to the healthcare crisis in America, changing many more lives for the better.
 
Wellness Clubs
 
In 2011, we piloted our new Wellness Clubs concept in four stores (www.wholefoodsmarket.com/wellnessclub). Whole Foods Market Wellness Clubs provide an inviting environment where members are empowered to make educated and positive lifestyle choices that promote their long-term health and well-being. The Clubs feature nutrition courses developed by medical doctors and a dietician; inspirational and informative skills-building classes; culinary classes; Supper Clubs and special events; coaching and support; a wellness assessment tool that keeps track of member progress; and access to a growing local network of community businesses offering additional benefits. Members also receive a 10% discount on thousands of designated healthy foods when they shop in stores where our Wellness Clubs are located. We are hopeful customers will embrace this idea, resulting in the opening of additional Wellness Clubs in the future.
 
Whole Planet Foundation®
 
Created in 2005, the Whole Planet Foundation (www.wholeplanetfoundation.org) is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to empower the poor through microcredit, with a focus on developing-world communities that supply our stores with product. Microcredit is a system pioneered by Professor Muhammad Yunus, founder of the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh and co-recipient of the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize. The philosophy behind microcredit is to provide the poor access to credit without requiring contracts or collateral, enabling them to lift themselves out of poverty by creating or expanding home-based businesses. Whole Foods Market covers all operating costs and the overhead budget for Whole Planet Foundation. Program grants are funded in part by the sale of products under the Company’s Whole Trade Guarantee Program, along with support from customers, vendors and team members. As of September 25, 2011, the Whole Planet Foundation has partnered with various microfinance institutions to support over $25.8 million in grants for 52 projects in 45 countries where the Company sources products. Over 161,000 borrower families (92% women) have received loans, which are being used for home-based businesses including poultry and pig farming, agriculture, furniture making, tailoring, and selling handicrafts,

homemade and bakery-made foods, clothing and footwear. It is estimated that each woman supports a family of almost six, which means our support is contributing to the prosperity of nearly one million individuals.
 
Whole Kids FoundationTM
 
In July 2011, we launched the Whole Kids Foundation (www.wholekidsfoundation.org), a non-profit organization dedicated to improving children’s nutrition through partnerships with schools, educators and other organizations. The foundation’s first major initiative is the Whole Kids School Garden Grant Project, a program that will enable schools to help build children’s relationships with food through the power of gardening. Our customers clearly support this initiative, recently donating more than $2 million during a six-week campaign, with Whole Foods Market donating an additional $0.2 million, to fund more than 1,000 school gardens. Whole Foods Market covers all operating costs and the overhead budget for the foundation. Other areas of focus are the foundation’s partnership with The Lunch Box Project (in 2009, Whole Foods Market and shoppers donated more than $0.7 million to fund this online resource for public schools created by Chef Ann Cooper’s F3 Foundation) and with Let’s Move Salad Bars to Schools as a founding member (in 2010, Whole Foods Market shoppers donated more than $1.4 million during a seven-week campaign to help fund 570 salad bars in schools across the country). Let’s Move Salad Bars to Schools has now funded 1,000 salad bars for schools. By 2013, the group hopes to have placed 6,000 salad bars in schools, and Whole Foods Market has pledged $1 million towards that effort.
 
Green Mission®
 
We are committed to supporting wise environmental practices and being a leader in environmental stewardship. Over the years, we have purchased over 4.3 billion megawatt hours of wind-based renewable energy, earning six Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) Green Power awards from 2004 through 2010. We have 14 stores and one distribution center using or hosting rooftop solar systems, four stores with fuel cells, and a commissary kitchen that is using biofuel from internally generated waste cooking oil. We have made a commitment to reduce energy consumption at all of our stores by 25% per square foot by 2015, and we build our new stores with the environment in mind, using green building innovations whenever possible. Twelve of our stores have received Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (“LEED”) certification by the U.S. Green Building Council, and four stores have earned Green Globes certification from the Green Building Initiative.
 
We discontinued the use of disposable plastic grocery bags at the checkouts in all stores in 2008 and refund at least a nickel per reusable bag at the checkout. We also were the first national retailer to provide Forest Stewardship Council (“FSC”) certified paper bags originating from 100% post-consumer recycled fiber. Nearly all of our stores are involved in a recycling program, and most participate in a composting program where food waste and compostable paper goods are regenerated into compost. Additionally, in 2007 we introduced fiber packaging in many of our prepared foods departments that is a compostable alternative to traditional petroleum and wood- or tree-based materials. We also are working to eliminate the use of Styrofoam in packing materials shipped to our Company and in product packaging in our stores.
 
Government and Public Affairs
 
Our stores are subject to various local, state, federal and international laws, regulations and administrative practices affecting our business. We must comply with provisions regulating health and sanitation standards, food labeling, equal employment, minimum wages, licensing for the sale of food, and in many stores, licensing for beer and wine or other alcoholic beverages.
 
The manufacturing, processing, formulating, packaging, labeling and advertising of products are subject to regulation by various federal agencies including the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”), the USDA and the EPA. The composition and labeling of nutritional supplements are most actively regulated by the FDA under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FFDC Act”). The FFDC Act has been revised in recent years with respect to dietary supplements by the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act and by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act. We believe we are in compliance with all product labeling requirements material to the Company.

Item 1A.   Risk Factors.
 
We wish to caution you that there are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those indicated by forward-looking statements that we make from time to time in filings with the SEC, news releases, reports, proxy statements, registration statements and other written communications, as well as oral forward-looking statements made from time to time by representatives of the Company. These risks and uncertainties include the risk factors described below. The cautionary statements below discuss important factors that could cause our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows to be materially adversely affected. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.
 
Economic conditions that adversely impact consumer spending could materially impact our business.
 
Our operating results may be materially impacted by changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer confidence and spending, including discretionary spending. There can be no assurance that various governmental activities to stabilize the markets and stimulate the economy will restore consumer confidence or change spending habits. Future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels, business conditions, changes in housing market conditions, the availability of credit, interest rates, tax rates, fuel and energy costs, the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism, and other matters could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to lower-priced competitors.
 
Our growth depends on increasing sales in identical stores and on new store openings, and our failure to achieve these goals could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
 
Our continued growth depends on our ability to increase sales in our identical stores and our ability to open new stores. Our operating results may be materially impacted by fluctuations in our identical store sales. Our identical store sales growth could be lower than our historical average for many reasons including the impact of new and acquired stores entering into the identical store base, the opening of new stores that cannibalize store sales in existing areas, general economic conditions, increased competition, price changes in response to competitive factors, possible supply shortages, and cycling against any year of above-average sales results.
 
Our growth strategy includes opening new stores in existing and new areas and operating those stores successfully. Successful implementation of this strategy is dependent on finding suitable locations, and we face competition from other retailers for such sites. There can be no assurance that we will continue to grow through new store openings. We may not be able to open new stores timely or operate them successfully. Also, we may not be able to successfully hire and train new team members or integrate those team members into the programs and policies of the Company. We may not be able to adapt our distribution, management information and other operating systems to adequately supply products to new stores at competitive prices so that we can operate the stores in a successful and profitable manner.
 
Increased competition may adversely affect our revenues and profitability.
 
Our competitors include but are not limited to local, regional, national and international supermarkets, natural food stores, warehouse membership clubs, small specialty stores and restaurants. Their businesses compete with us for products, customers and locations. In addition, some are expanding more aggressively in marketing a range of natural and organic foods. Some of these potential competitors may have been in business longer or may have greater financial or marketing resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to sourcing, promoting and selling their products. As competition in certain areas intensifies, our operating results may be negatively impacted through a loss of sales, reduction in margin from competitive price changes, and/or greater operating costs such as marketing.

We may experience fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations, which may adversely affect our stock price.
 
Our quarterly operating results and quarter-to-quarter comparisons could fluctuate for many reasons, including, but not limited to, variations in the mix of product sales, price changes in response to competitive factors, seasonality, increases in store operating costs, including commodity costs, possible supply shortages, general economic conditions, extreme weather-related disruptions, and other business costs. In addition, our results may be impacted by the timing of new store openings, construction and pre-opening expenses, the timing of acquisitions, store closures and relocations, and the range of operating results generated from newly opened stores.
 
Our stock price has been volatile and may be negatively affected by reasons unrelated to our operating performance.
 
In fiscal year 2011, the closing market price per share of our common stock ranged from $34.57 to $72.10. The market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuation in response to various market factors and events. These market factors and events include variations in our sales and earnings results and any failure to meet market expectations; changes in ratings and earnings estimates by securities analysts; publicity regarding us, our competitors, or the natural products industry generally; new statutes or regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing statutes or regulations affecting the natural products industry specifically; and sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales could occur and other factors. In addition, the stock market, at times, experiences broad price fluctuations that may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
 
Adverse publicity may reduce our brand value and negatively impact our business.
 
We believe our Company has built an excellent reputation as a food retailer, socially responsible corporation and employer. We believe our continued success depends on our ability to preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brand. Brand value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities, and even isolated incidents can erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation, which can have an adverse impact on these perceptions and lead to adverse affects on our business or team members.
 
Changes in the availability of quality natural and organic products could impact our business.
 
There is no assurance that quality natural and organic products will be available to meet our needs. If other supermarkets significantly increase their natural and organic product offerings, if new laws require the reformulation of certain products to meet tougher standards, or if natural disasters or other catastrophic events occur, the supply of these products may be constrained.
 
Disruption of significant supplier relationships could negatively affect our business.
 
United Natural Foods, Inc. is our single largest third-party supplier, accounting for approximately 31% of our total purchases in fiscal year 2011. During fiscal year 2010, we extended our long-term relationship with UNFI as our primary supplier of dry grocery and frozen food products through 2020 and added two of our regions to our distribution arrangement beginning in fiscal year 2011. Due to this concentration of purchases from a single third-party supplier, the cancellation of our distribution arrangement or the disruption, delay or inability of UNFI to deliver product to our stores may materially and adversely affect our operating results while we establish alternative distribution channels.
 
Future events could result in impairment of long-lived assets, which may result in charges that adversely affect our results of operations and capitalization.
 
Our total assets included long-lived assets totaling approximately $2.06 billion at September 25, 2011. Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Our impairment evaluations require use of financial estimates of future cash flows. Application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results. We may be required to recognize impairments of long-lived assets based on future economic factors such as unfavorable changes in estimated future undiscounted cash flows of an asset group.
 
We have significant lease obligations, which may require us to continue paying rent for store locations that we no longer operate.
 
The majority of our stores, distribution centers, bakehouses and administrative facilities are leased. We are subject to risks associated with our current and future real estate leases. Our costs could increase because of changes in the real estate markets and supply or demand for real estate sites. We generally cannot cancel our leases, so if we decide to close a location, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including paying the base rent for the remaining lease term. As each lease expires, we may fail to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or any terms at all. As of September 25, 2011, we had 20 leased properties that are not being utilized in current operations. These properties represent acquired dormant locations, stores closed post-acquisition, and stores closed due to relocation.

Claims under our self-insurance program may differ from our estimates, which could materially impact our results of operations.
 
The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance plans to provide for the potential liabilities for workers’ compensation, general liability, property insurance, director and officers’ liability insurance, vehicle liability and team member health-care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Our results could be materially impacted by claims and other expenses related to such plans if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends.
 
Perishable foods product losses could materially impact our results of operations.
 
Our stores offer a significant number of perishable products, accounting for approximately 66.8% of our total sales in fiscal year 2011. The Company’s emphasis on perishable products may result in significant product inventory losses in the event of extended power outages, natural disasters or other catastrophic occurrences.
 
Actual or perceived food safety concerns may adversely affect our sales.
 
There is increasing governmental scrutiny of and public awareness regarding food safety. We believe that many customers choose to shop our stores because of their interest in health, nutrition and food safety. We believe that our customers hold us to a higher food safety standard than other supermarkets. The real or perceived sale of contaminated food products by us could result in government enforcement action, private litigation, product recalls and other liabilities, the settlement or outcome of which might have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
 
Pending or future legal proceedings could materially impact our results of operations.
 
From time to time, we are party to legal proceedings, including matters involving personnel and employment issues, personal injury, intellectual property, acquisitions, and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Our results could be materially impacted by the decisions and expenses related to pending or future proceedings.
 
Changes in accounting standards and estimates could materially impact our results of operations.
 
Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations for many aspects of our business, such as accounting for insurance and self-insurance, inventories, goodwill and intangible assets, derivatives, store closures, leases, income taxes and share-based payments, are highly complex and involve subjective judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying estimates, assumptions or judgments by our management could significantly change or add significant volatility to our reported earnings without a comparable underlying change in cash flow from operations.
 
The loss of key management could negatively affect our business.
 
We are dependent upon a number of key management and other team members. If we were to lose the services of a significant number of key team members within a short period of time, this could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We do not maintain key person insurance on any team member. Our continued success also is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified team members to meet our future growth needs. We face intense competition for qualified team members, many of whom are subject to offers from competing employers. We may not be able to attract and retain necessary team members to operate our business.
 
A widespread health epidemic could materially impact our business.
 
The Company’s business could be severely impacted by a widespread regional, national or global health epidemic. Our stores are a place where customers come together, interact and learn while at the same time discover the many joys of eating and sharing food. A widespread health epidemic may cause customers to avoid public gathering places or otherwise change their shopping behaviors. Additionally, a widespread health epidemic could also adversely impact our business by disrupting production and delivery of products to our stores and by impacting our ability to appropriately staff our stores.
 
Our investments in money market funds and certain other securities are subject to market risks, which may result in losses.
 
As of September 25, 2011, we had money market fund investments that are classified as short-term cash equivalent investments and restricted cash investments totaling approximately $75.9 million and $92.0 million, respectively, and approximately $495.1 million in available-for-sale marketable securities. We have invested these amounts primarily in state and local municipal obligations, government agency securities, corporate commercial paper, and money market funds meeting certain criteria. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks that could have a negative impact on our results of operations.
 
Unions may attempt to organize our team members, which could harm our business.
 
All of our team members are non-union, and we consider our team member relations to be very strong. From time to time, however, unions have attempted to organize all or part of our team member base at certain stores and non-retail facilities.
 
14






Table of Contents
 
Responding to such organization attempts is distracting to management and team members and may have a negative financial impact on a store, facility or the Company as a whole.
 
Unfavorable changes in governmental regulation could harm our business.
 
The Company is subject to various international, federal, state and local laws, regulations and administrative practices affecting our business, and we must comply with provisions regulating health and sanitation standards, food labeling, equal employment, minimum wages, and licensing for the sale of food and, in some stores, alcoholic beverages. Our new store openings could be delayed or prevented or our existing stores could be impacted by difficulties or failures in our ability to obtain or maintain required approvals or licenses. Changes in existing laws or implementation of new laws, regulations and practices (e.g., health care reform and/or “card check” legislation) could have a significant impact on our business.
 
The USDA’s Organic Rule facilitates interstate commerce and the marketing of organically produced food, and provides assurance to our customers that such products meet consistent, uniform standards. Compliance with this rule could pose a significant burden on some of our suppliers, which may cause a disruption in some of our product offerings.
 
We cannot predict the nature of future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, or determine what effect either additional government regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, or disparate federal, state and local regulatory schemes would have on our business in the future. They could, however, require the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, the recall or discontinuance of certain products not able to be reformulated, additional recordkeeping, expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling and/or scientific substantiation. Any or all of such requirements could have an adverse effect on our operating results.
 
The risk associated with doing business in other countries could materially impact our results of operations.
 
Though only 3.1% of our total sales in fiscal year 2011, the Company’s international operations are subject to certain risks of conducting business abroad, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in regulatory requirements, and changes or uncertainties in the economic, social and political conditions in the Company’s geographic areas, among other things.
 
We may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, which could harm our business.
 
We rely on a combination of trademark, trade secret and copyright law and internal procedures and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property. There can be no assurance that our intellectual property rights can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products may be produced or sold do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Failure to protect our proprietary information could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Effective tax rate changes and results of examinations by taxing authorities could materially impact our results of operations.
 
Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the earnings mix being lower than historical results in states or countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher-than-historical results in states or countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof. In addition, we are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other state and local taxing authorities. Our results could be materially impacted by the determinations and expenses related to proceedings by the IRS and other state and local taxing authorities. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, “Income Taxes”, in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
 
Disruptions in our information systems could harm our ability to run our business.
 
We rely extensively on information systems for point-of-sale processing in our stores, supply chain, financial reporting, human resources and various other processes and transactions. Our information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, including breaches of our transaction processing or other systems that could result in the compromise of confidential customer data, catastrophic events, and usage errors by our team members. If our systems are breached, damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make significant investments to fix or replace them, suffer interruptions in our operations, face costly litigation, and our reputation with our customers may be harmed. Any material interruption in our information systems may have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
 
A failure of our internal control over financial reporting could materially impact our business or stock price.
 
The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. An internal control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud, and could expose us to litigation or adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The Company’s management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 25, 2011. See “Item 9A. Controls and Procedures — Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.”
