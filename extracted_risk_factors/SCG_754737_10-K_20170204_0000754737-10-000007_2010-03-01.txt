    COMPETITION
     
    For a
discussion of the impact of competition, see the Overview section of
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations for SCANA and SCE&G.
     
    CAPITAL
REQUIREMENTS
     
    SCANA’s
regulated subsidiaries, including SCE&G, require cash to fund operations,
construction programs and dividend payments to SCANA.  SCANA’s
nonregulated subsidiaries require cash to fund operations and dividend payments
to SCANA.  To replace existing plant investment and to expand to meet
future demand for electricity and gas, SCANA’s regulated subsidiaries must
attract the necessary financial capital on reasonable
terms.  Regulated subsidiaries recover the costs of providing services
through rates charged to customers.  Rates for regulated services are
generally based on historical costs.  As customer growth and inflation
occur and these subsidiaries continue their construction programs, rate
increases will be sought.  The future financial position and results
of operations of the regulated subsidiaries will be affected by their ability to
obtain adequate and timely rate and other regulatory relief, when
requested.
     
    For a
discussion of various rate matters and their impact on capital requirements, see
the Regulatory Matters section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations for SCANA and SCE&G and
Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for SCANA and
SCE&G.
     
    During
the period 2010-2012, SCANA and SCE&G expect to meet capital requirements
through internally generated funds, issuance of equity and short-term and
long-term borrowings.  SCANA and SCE&G expect that they have or
can obtain adequate sources of financing to meet their projected cash
requirements for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable
future.
     
    For a
discussion of cash requirements for construction and nuclear fuel expenditures,
contractual cash obligations, financing limits, financing transactions and other
related information, see the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations for SCANA and SCE&G.
     
    SCANA’s
ratios of earnings to fixed charges were 2.84, 3.04, 3.03, 2.94 and 2.19 for the
years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
 SCE&G’s ratios of earnings to fixed charges were 3.25, 3.51, 3.40,
3.32 and 2.26 for the same periods.  SCANA’s and SCE&G’s ratios
for 2005 were negatively impacted by large amounts of accelerated depreciation
that were recorded under an accounting methodology approved by the Public
Service Commission of South Carolina (SCPSC), and because the calculations
necessarily exclude the related and fully offsetting synthetic fuel tax benefits
recorded in that year.

    Sales for
resale include sales to six municipalities.  Sales under NMST during
2009 include sales to nine investor-owned utilities or registered marketers,
three electric cooperatives and three federal/state electric
agencies.  During 2008 sales under the NMST included sales to 13
investor-owned utilities or registered marketers, four electric cooperatives and
four federal/state electric agencies.
     
        During 2009
SCE&G recorded a net increase of approximately 5,200 electric customers
(growth rate of 0.8%), increasing its total electric customers to approximately
655,000 at year end.
     
    For the
period 2010-2012, SCE&G projects total territorial KWh sales of electricity
to increase 1.4% annually (assuming normal weather), total electric customer
base to increase 2.1% annually and territorial peak load (summer, in MW) to
increase 1.7% annually.  While SCE&G’s goal is to maintain a
reserve margin of between 12% and 18%, weather and other factors affect
territorial peak load and can cause actual generating capacity on any given day
to fall below the reserve margin goal.
     
    Electric
Interconnections
     
    SCE&G
purchases all of the electric generation of GENCO’s Williams Station under a
Unit Power Sales Agreement which has been approved by FERC.  Williams
Station has a net generating capacity (summer rating) of 570 MW.
     
    SCE&G’s
transmission system is part of an interconnected grid extending over a large
part of the southern and eastern portions of the nation.  SCE&G
interconnects with Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy Carolinas, and Santee
Cooper.  SCE&G also interconnects with Georgia Power Company,
Oglethorpe Power Corporation and the Southeastern Power Administration’s Clarks
Hill Project.  SCE&G, Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy
Carolinas, Santee Cooper, Dominion Virginia Power and ALCOA Power Generating,
Inc. (Yadkin Division), are members of the Virginia-Carolinas Reliability Group
(VACAR), one of several geographic divisions within the SERC Reliability
Corporation (SERC).  SERC is one of eight regional entities with
delegated authority from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation
(NERC) for the purpose of proposing and enforcing reliability standards approved
by NERC within the SERC region.  SERC is divided geographically into
five diverse sub-regions that are identified as Central, Delta, Gateway,
Southeastern and VACAR.  The regional entities and all members of NERC
work to safeguard the reliability of the bulk power systems throughout North
America.  For a discussion of the impact certain legislative and
regulatory initiatives may have on SCE&G’s transmission system, see Electric
Operations within the Overview section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for SCANA and
SCE&G.

    Six of
the seven fossil fuel-fired plants use coal.  Unit trains and, in some
cases, trucks and barges deliver coal to these plants.
     
    As coal
costs increased and gas prices decreased during 2009, SCE&G’s mix of
generation dispatched shifted.
    
    Coal is
obtained through long-term supply contracts and spot market
purchases.  Long-term contracts exist with 11 suppliers located in
eastern Kentucky, Tennessee and West Virginia.  These contracts
provide for approximately 5.6 million tons annually, which is 98% of total
expected coal purchases for 2010.  Sulfur restrictions on the contract
coal range from 1% to 2%. These contracts expire at various times through
2012.  Spot market purchases are expected to continue when needed or
when prices are believed to be favorable.
     
    SCANA and
SCE&G believe that SCE&G’s operations comply with all existing
regulations relating to the discharge of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen
oxides.  See additional discussion at Environmental Matters in
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations for SCANA and SCE&G.
     
    SCE&G

can store spent nuclear fuel on-site until at least 2018 and expects to expand
its storage capacity to accommodate the spent fuel output for the life of Summer
Station through dry cask storage or other technology as it becomes
available.  In addition, Summer Station has sufficient on-site storage
capacity to permit storage of the entire reactor core in the event that complete
unloading should become desirable or necessary.  For information about

    For the
three-year period 2010-2012, SCANA projects total consolidated sales of
regulated natural gas in DTs to increase 1.4% annually (assuming normal
weather).  Annual projected increases over such period in DT sales
include residential of 2.1%, commercial of 1.1% and industrial
of 1.8%.
     
    For the
three-year period 2010-2012, SCE&G projects total consolidated sales of

    For the
three-year period 2010-2012, SCANA’s and SCE&G’s total consolidated
regulated natural gas customer base is projected to increase annually 2.4% and
1.2%, respectively.  During 2009 SCANA recorded a net increase of
approximately 7,700 regulated gas customers (growth rate of 1.0%), increasing
its regulated gas customers to approximately 782,000.  Of this increase,
SCE&G recorded a net increase of approximately 2,600 gas customers (growth
rate of 0.9%), increasing its total gas customers to approximately 310,000 (as
of December 31, 2009).
     
    Demand
for gas changes primarily due to the effect of weather and the price

    South
Carolina
     
    SCE&G
purchases natural gas under contracts with producers and marketers in both the
spot and long-term markets.  The gas is delivered to South Carolina
through firm transportation agreements with Southern Natural (expiring in 2012),
Transco (expiring in 2012 and 2017) and CGT (expiring in 2011 and
2012).  The maximum daily volume of gas that SCE&G is entitled to
transport under these contracts is 161,144 DT from Southern Natural, 64,652 DT
from Transco and 314,529 DT from CGT.  Additional natural gas volumes
may be delivered to SCE&G’s system as capacity is available through
interruptible transportation.  In addition, SCE&G, under contract
with SEMI, is entitled to receive up to a daily contract demand of 120,000 DT
for use in either electric generation or for resale to SCE&G’s
customers.
     
    The daily
volume of gas that SEMI is entitled to transport under its service agreement
with CGT (expiring in 2023) on a firm basis is 198,083 DT.
     
    SCE&G
purchased natural gas at an average cost of $7.01 per MCF during 2009 and $10.50
per MCF during 2008.
     
    SCE&G
was allocated 5,437 MMCF of natural gas storage capacity on Southern Natural and
Transco.  Approximately 4,100 MMCF of gas were in storage on
December 31, 2009.  To meet the requirements of its high priority
natural gas customers during periods of maximum demand, SCE&G supplements
its supplies of natural gas with two LNG liquefaction and storage
facilities.  The LNG plants are capable of storing the liquefied
equivalent of 1,880 MMCF of natural gas.  Approximately 1,800 MMCF
(liquefied equivalent) of gas were in storage on December 31,
2009.

    PSNC
Energy purchases natural gas under contracts with producers and marketers on a
short-term basis at current prices and on a long-term basis for reliability
assurance at index prices plus a reservation charge.  Transco and
Dominion deliver the gas to North Carolina through transportation agreements
with expiration dates ranging through 2016.  On a peak day, PSNC
Energy may transport daily volumes of gas under these contracts on a firm basis
of 259,894 DT from Transco and 7,331 DT from Dominion.
     
    PSNC
Energy purchased natural gas at an average cost of $6.02 per DT during 2009
compared to $10.65 per DT during 2008.
     
    To meet
the requirements of its high priority natural gas customers during periods of
maximum demand, PSNC Energy supplements its supplies of natural gas with
underground natural gas storage services and LNG peaking
services.  Underground natural gas storage service agreements with
Dominion, Columbia Gas Transmission, Transco and Spectra Energy provide for
storage capacity of approximately 13,000 MMCF.  Approximately 9,300 MMCF of
gas were in storage under these agreements at December 31, 2009.  In
addition, PSNC Energy’s LNG facility can store the liquefied equivalent of 1,000
MMCF of natural gas with regasification capability of approximately 100 MMCF per
day.  Approximately 900 MMCF (liquefied equivalent) of gas were in storage
at December 31, 2009.  LNG storage service agreements with
Transco, Cove Point LNG and Pine Needle LNG provide for 1,300 MMCF
(liquefied equivalent) of storage space.  Approximately 1,100 MMCF
(liquefied equivalent) were in storage under these agreements at
December 31, 2009.
     
    SCANA and
SCE&G believe that supplies under long-term contracts and supplies available
for spot market purchase are adequate to meet existing customer demands and to
accommodate growth.

in the state.
     
    Risk
Management
     
    SCANA and
SCE&G have established policies and procedures and risk limits to control
the level of market, credit, liquidity and operational and administrative risks
assumed by them.  SCANA's Board of Directors has delegated to a Risk
Management Committee the authority to set risk limits, establish policies and
procedures for risk management and measurement, and to oversee and review the
risk management process and infrastructure for SCANA and each of its
subsidiaries.  The Risk Management Committee, which is comprised of
certain officers, including a Risk Management Officer and several senior
officers, apprises the Board of Directors with regard to the management of risk
and brings to the Board’s attention any areas of
concern.  Written policies define the physical and financial
transactions that are approved, as well as the authorization requirements and
limits for transactions.

    The
current license for the Saluda project expires August 31,
2010.  SCE&G applied to FERC for relicensing of the Saluda project
on August 27, 2008.  This application is currently being reviewed by
FERC.  SCE&G expects a decision by FERC in August
2010.

    At the
termination of a license under the Federal Power Act, FERC may extend or issue a
new license to the previous licensee, may issue a license to another applicant
or the federal government may take over the related project.  If the
federal government takes over a project or if FERC issues a license to another
applicant, the federal government or the new licensee, as the case may be, must
pay the previous licensee an amount equal to its net investment in the project,
not to exceed fair value, plus severance damages.

a discussion of legislative and regulatory initiatives being implemented that
will affect SCE&G’s transmission system, see Electric Operations within the
Overview section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations for SCANA and SCE&G.
     
    SCE&G
is subject to regulation by the NRC with respect to the ownership, construction,
operation and decommissioning of its currently operating and planned nuclear
generating facilities.  The NRC’s jurisdiction encompasses broad
supervisory and regulatory powers over the construction and operation of nuclear
reactors, including matters of health and safety, antitrust considerations and
environmental impact.  In addition, the Federal Emergency Management
Agency reviews, in conjunction with the NRC, certain aspects of emergency
planning relating to the operation of nuclear plants.
     
    RATE
MATTERS
     
    For a
discussion of the impact of various rate matters, see the Regulatory Matters
section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations for SCANA and SCE&G, and Note 2 to the
consolidated financial statements for SCANA and SCE&G.
     
    SCE&G’s
gas rate schedules for its residential, small commercial and small industrial
customers include a Weather Normalization Adjustment (WNA) approved by the SCPSC
which is in effect for bills rendered for billing cycles in November through
April.  The WNA increases tariff rates if weather is warmer than
normal and decreases rates if weather is colder than normal.  The WNA
does not change the seasonality of gas revenues, but reduces fluctuations in
revenues and earnings caused by abnormal weather.
    
    PSNC
Energy is authorized by the NCUC to utilize a CUT, a rate decoupling mechanism
that breaks the link between revenues and the amount of natural gas
sold.  The CUT allows PSNC Energy to periodically adjust its base
rates for residential and commercial customers based on average per customer
consumption whether impacted by weather or other
factors.  
     
    In January 2010, SCE&G filed an
application with SCPSC requesting a 9.52% overall increase to retail electric
base rates.  If approved, the increase in rates would be phased in
over three periods in July 2010, January 2011 and July 2011.  A public
hearing on this matter is scheduled to begin on May 24, 2010.
    
    In
February 2009, the SCPSC approved SCE&G’s combined application pursuant to
the Base Load Review Act (the BLRA) seeking a certificate of environmental
compatibility and public convenience and necessity and for a base load review
order relating to proposed construction and operation by SCE&G and Santee
Cooper of two new nuclear generating units at Summer Station.   Under
the BLRA, the SCPSC conducted a full pre-construction prudency review of the
proposed units and the engineering, procurement, and construction contract under
which they are being built.  The SCPSC prudency finding is binding on
all future related rate proceedings so long as the construction proceeds in
accordance with schedules, estimates and projections, including contingencies,
as approved by the SCPSC.  As part of its order, the SCPSC approved
the initial rate increase of $7.8 million, or 0.4%, related to recovery of the
cost of capital on project expenditures through June 30, 2008, and the revised
rates became effective for bills rendered on and after March 29,
2009.  In addition, SCE&G is allowed to file revised rates with
the SCPSC each year to incorporate the financing cost of any incremental
construction work in progress incurred for new nuclear
generation.  Requested rate adjustments are based on
SCE&G’s updated cost of debt and capital structure and on an allowed
return on common equity of 11%.  In May 2009, two intervenors filed
separate appeals of the order (one of which challenged the SCPSC’s prudency
finding) with the South Carolina Supreme Court.  A hearing for one
appeal is set for March 4, 2010, and the hearing for the other appeal has not
been set.  SCE&G cannot predict how or when the appeals will be
resolved.  In September 2009, the SCPSC approved SCE&G’s first
annual revised rate request under the BLRA which constituted a $22.5 million or
1.1% increase to retail electric rates.  In January 2010, the SCPSC
approved SCE&G’s request under the BLRA to approve an updated construction
and capital cost schedule for the new units.  The revised schedule
does not change the previously announced completion date for the new units or
the originally announced cost.
    
    Fuel Cost
Recovery Procedures
     
    In June
2009, SCE&G filed a request with the SCPSC for approval of certain demand
reduction and energy efficiency programs (DSM programs).  SCE&G
has requested the establishment of an annual rider to allow recovery of the
costs and lost net margin revenue associated with DSM programs along with an
incentive for investing in such programs.  The SCPSC has scheduled a
hearing on SCE&G’s request for April 1, 2010.

        Table of Contents
      
    
    
    
    The
SCPSC’s fuel cost recovery procedure determines the fuel component in
SCE&G’s retail electric base rates annually based on projected fuel costs
for the ensuing 12-month period, adjusted for any over-collection or
under-collection from the preceding 12-month period.  The statutory
definition of fuel costs includes certain variable environmental costs, such as
ammonia, lime, limestone and catalysts consumed in reducing or treating
emissions.  The definition also includes the cost of emission
allowances used for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury and
particulates.  SCE&G may request a formal proceeding at any time should
circumstances dictate such a review.  In April 2009, the SCPSC
approved a settlement agreement between SCE&G and the South Carolina Office
of Regulatory Staff (ORS) and others, whereby SCE&G increased the fuel cost
portion of its electric rates effective with the first billing cycle of May
2009.  As part of the settlement, SCE&G agreed to spread the
recovery of then under- collected fuel costs over a three-year period ending
April 2012.  SCE&G is allowed to collect interest on the deferred
balance.
     
    SCE&G’s
tariffs include a purchased gas adjustment (PGA) clause that provides for the
recovery of actual gas cost incurred, including costs related to hedging natural
gas purchasing activities.  SCE&G’s rates are calculated using a
methodology which adjusts the cost of gas monthly based on a twelve-month
rolling average.
    
                        PSNC
Energy is subject to a Rider D rate mechanism which allows it to recover, in any
manner authorized by the NCUC, losses on negotiated gas and transportation
sales.  The Rider D rate mechanism also allows PSNC Energy to recover
from customers all prudently incurred gas costs and certain uncollectible
expenses related to gas cost.
     
    PSNC
Energy’s rates are established using a benchmark cost of gas approved by the
NCUC, which may be adjusted periodically to reflect changes in the market price
of natural gas.  PSNC Energy revises its tariffs with the NCUC as
necessary to track these changes, and accounts for any over- or
under-collections of the delivered cost of gas in its deferred accounts for
subsequent rate consideration.  The NCUC reviews PSNC Energy’s gas
purchasing practices annually.
     
    ENVIRONMENTAL
MATTERS
     
    Federal
and state authorities have imposed environmental regulations and standards
relating primarily to air emissions, wastewater discharges and solid, toxic and
hazardous waste management.  Developments in these areas may require
that equipment and facilities be modified, supplemented or
replaced.  The ultimate effect of these regulations and standards upon
existing and proposed operations cannot be predicted.  For a more
complete discussion of how these regulations and standards impact SCANA and
SCE&G, see the Environmental Matters section of Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for SCANA and
SCE&G and Note 11B to the consolidated financial statements for SCANA
and SCE&G.

    ITEM
1A.  RISK FACTORS
                
    The
risk factors that follow relate in each case to SCANA Corporation (SCANA) and
its subsidiaries (together, the Company), and where indicated the risk factors
also relate to South Carolina Electric & Gas Company and its consolidated
affiliates (SCE&G).
     
     
    Commodity
price changes, delays and other factors may affect the operating cost, capital
expenditures and competitive positions of the Company's and SCE&G's energy
businesses, thereby adversely impacting results of operations, cash flows and
financial condition.
     
     Our energy businesses are
sensitive to changes in coal, gas, oil and other commodity prices and
availability. Any such changes could affect the prices these businesses charge,
their operating costs and the competitive position of their products and
services. SCE&G is able to recover the cost of fuel (including
transportation) used in electric generation through retail customers' bills, but
increases in fuel costs affect electric prices and, therefore, the competitive
position of electricity against other energy sources. In the case of regulated
natural gas operations, costs for purchased gas and pipeline capacity are
recovered through retail customers' bills, but increases in gas costs affect
total retail prices and, therefore, the competitive position of gas relative to
electricity and other forms of energy. Increases in gas costs may also result in
lower usage by customers unable to switch to alternate fuels.  Increases in
fuel costs may also result in lower usage of electricity by
customers.   Furthermore, certain construction commodities such
as copper and aluminum, which are used in our transmission and distribution
lines and our electrical equipment, steel and concrete have experienced
significant price volatility due to changes in worldwide
demand.  Also, to operate our air pollution control equipment, we use
significant quantities of ammonia, limestone and lime.  With mandated
compliance deadlines for air pollution controls, demand for these reagents may
increase and result in higher purchase costs.

        Table of Contents
      
    
    
    The
costs of large capital projects, such as the Company’s and SCE&G’s
construction for environmental compliance and its construction of two new
nuclear units, are significant and are subject to a number of risks and
uncertainties that may adversely affect the cost, timing and satisfactory
completion of the projects.
    
    The
Company's and SCE&G's business is capital intensive and requires significant
investments in energy generation and in other internal infrastructure projects,
such as projects for environmental compliance.  For example, SCE&G
and the South Carolina Public Service Authority (Santee Cooper) have agreed to
jointly own, design, construct and operate two new 1,117-megawatt nuclear units
at SCE&G's V.C. Summer Nuclear Station (the New Units), pursuant to which
they are expending substantial resources for the evaluation, development and
permitting of the project, site preparation and long lead-time procurement;
substantial additional resources will be required for the construction and
continued operation of the plant upon receipt of requisite approvals. Achieving
the intended benefits of a large capital project of this type is subject to a
number of uncertainties.   For instance, the completion of
projects within established budgets and timeframes is contingent upon many
variables, including the obtaining of permits and licenses in a timely manner,
our timely securing of labor and materials at estimated costs, our ability to
finance such projects and weather.  These projects also could be
adversely affected by contractor or supplier non-performance, unforeseen
engineering problems or changes in project design or scope. Our ability to
maintain our operations or to complete construction projects (including new
baseload generation) at reasonable cost, if at all, could be adversely affected
by the availability of key parts or commodities, increases in the price of or
the unavailability of labor, commodities or other materials, increases in lead
times for components, increased environmental pressures, a failure in the supply
chain (whether resulting from the foregoing or other factors), and disruptions
in the transportation of fuels.  Furthermore, joint venture projects,
such as the current construction of the New Units, are subject to the risk that
the joint venture partner is either unable or unwilling to continue to fund its
financial commitments to the projects.  To the extent that delays
occur, costs are not recoverable, or we are unable to otherwise effectively
manage our capital projects, our results of operations, cash flows and financial
condition may be adversely affected.
    
     
     The use of
derivative instruments could result in financial losses and liquidity
constraints.  The Company and SCE&G do not fully hedge against
price changes in commodities. This could result in increased costs, thereby
resulting in lower margins and adversely affecting results of operations, cash
flows and financial condition.
     
    The Company and SCE&G use
derivative instruments, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, to
manage our commodity and financial market risks.  In the future, we
could recognize financial losses on these contracts as a result of volatility in
the market values of the underlying commodities and interest rate contracts or
if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract.
    
    The
Company and SCE&G attempt to manage commodity price exposure by establishing
risk limits and entering into contracts to offset some of our positions (i.e.,
to hedge our exposure to demand, market effects of weather and other changes in
commodity prices). We do not hedge the entire exposure of our operations from
commodity price volatility. To the extent we do not hedge against commodity
price volatility or our hedges are not effective, results of operations, cash
flows and financial condition may be diminished.
      
    
    Changing
and complex laws and regulations to which the Company and SCE&G are subject
could adversely affect revenues or increase costs or curtail activities, thereby
adversely impacting results of operations, cash flows and financial
condition.
     
    The
Company and SCE&G operate under the regulatory authority of the United
States government and its various regulatory agencies, including the United
States Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the United States Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC), the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC), the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), and a number of others.  In addition, the
Company and SCE&G are subject to regulation by agencies of the state
governments of South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia, including regulatory
commissions, state environmental commissions, state employment commissions, and
a number of others.  Accordingly, the Company and SCE&G must
comply with extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations. Such
regulation widely affects the operation of our business. The effects encompass,
among many other aspects of our business, the licensing and siting of
facilities, safety, reliability of our transmission system, physical and cyber
security of key assets, customer conservation through demand-side management
programs, information privacy, the issuance of securities and borrowing of
money, financial reporting, interaction among affiliates, the payment of
dividends and employment practices. Changes to these regulations are ongoing,
and we cannot predict the future course of changes in this regulatory
environment or the ultimate effect that this changing regulatory environment
will have on the Company’s or SCE&G’s business.

        Table of Contents
      
    
                The
Company and SCE&G are subject to extensive rate regulation which could
adversely affect operations. In particular, SCE&G's electric operations in
South Carolina and the Company's gas distribution operations in South Carolina
(comprised of SCE&G) and North Carolina are regulated by state utilities
commissions. The Company’s interstate gas pipeline and SCE&G’s electric
transmission system and nuclear operations are subject to extensive regulation
and oversight from federal agencies, including the FERC and NRC.  Our
gas marketing operations in Georgia are subject to state regulatory oversight
and, for a portion of its operations, to rate regulation. There can be no
assurance that Georgia’s gas delivery regulatory framework will remain unchanged
as dynamic market conditions evolve. Although we believe we have constructive
relationships with our regulators, our ability to obtain rate increases that
will allow us to maintain reasonable rates of return is dependent upon
regulatory discretion, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to
implement rate increases when sought.
     
     
    The
Company and SCE&G are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations
that require significant capital expenditures, that can increase our costs of
operations and which may impact our business plans, or expose us to
environmental liabilities.
      
    The
Company and SCE&G are presently subject to extensive federal, state and
local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air
emissions (such as reducing nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, mercury emissions
and particulate matter). There is a growing consensus that some form of
regulation will be forthcoming at the federal, and possibly state, levels to
impose limitations on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from fossil fuel-fired
electric generating units.  A number of bills have been introduced in
Congress that would require GHG emissions reductions from fossil fuel-fired
electric generation facilities, natural gas facilities and other sectors of the
economy, although none have yet been enacted.  In addition, the EPA is
drafting a rule regarding the handling of coal ash and other combustion waste
produced by power plants and a new mercury control rule to replace the prior
Clean Air Mercury Rule.  The EPA is expected to implement MACT
(maximum achievable control technology) standards for mercury and other
pollutants.  Furthermore, the EPA has announced that it expects to
overhaul rules governing effluent limitation standards for coal-fired power
plants.
    
    Compliance
with these laws and regulations requires us to commit significant capital toward
environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment, emission
fees and permits at our facilities. These expenditures have been significant in
the past and are expected to increase in the future. Changes in compliance
requirements or a more burdensome interpretation by governmental authorities of
existing requirements may impose additional costs on us (such as additional
taxes or emission allowances) or require us to incur additional capital
expenditures or curtail some of our activities (such as the recycling of fly ash
and other coal combustion products for beneficial use). Compliance with any GHG
emission reduction requirements, including any mandated portfolio renewable
standards, also may impose significant costs on us, and the resulting price
increases to our customers may lower customer consumption.  Such costs of
compliance with environmental regulations could harm our industry, our business
and our results of operations and financial position, especially if emission or
discharge limits are reduced, more extensive permitting requirements are imposed
or additional regulatory requirements are imposed.
     
    Furthermore, the Company and SCE&G
are subject to the possibility that electric generation portfolio standards may
be enacted at the federal or state level.  Such standards could direct
us to build or otherwise acquire generating capacity derived from alternative
energy sources (generally, renewable energy such as biomass, solar, wind and
tidal, and excluding fossil fuels, nuclear or hydro facilities).  Such
alternative energy may not be readily available in our service territories, and
could be extremely costly to build or acquire, if at all, and to
operate.  Resulting increases in the price of electricity to recover
the cost of these types of generation, if approved by regulatory commissions,
could result in lower usage of electricity by our customers.  Although
we cannot predict whether such standards will be adopted or their specifics if
adopted, compliance with such potential portfolio standards could significantly
impact our industry, our capital expenditures, and our results of operations and
financial position.
     
    
    The
Company and SCE&G are vulnerable to interest rate increases which would
increase our borrowing costs, and may not have access to capital at favorable
rates, if at all.  Additionally, potential disruptions in the capital and
credit markets may further adversely affect the availability and cost of
short-term funds for liquidity requirements and our ability to meet long-term
commitments; each could in turn adversely affect our results of operations, cash
flows and financial condition.
    
                   
The Company and SCE&G rely on the capital markets, particularly for publicly
offered debt and equity, as well as the banking and commercial paper markets, to
meet our financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs if internal funds
are not available from operations. Changes in interest rates affect the cost of
borrowing. The Company's and SCE&G’s business plans, which include
significant investments in energy generation and other internal infrastructure
projects,  reflect the expectation that we will have access to the
capital markets on satisfactory terms to fund commitments. Moreover, the ability
to maintain short-term liquidity by utilizing commercial paper programs is
dependent upon maintaining investment grade debt ratings and the existence of a
market for our commercial paper generally.

        Table of Contents
      
    
    In mid-September 2008, a very severe
dislocation of the commercial paper, long-term debt and equity markets occurred
as concerns over bank solvency adversely affected the credit
markets.  As a result, access to these capital markets was very
limited.  Further, the amount of our outstanding commercial paper was
significantly reduced, and the interest rates on such outstanding commercial
paper significantly increased.  Although the operation of these
markets has returned to normal, the Company and SCE&G cannot predict whether
similar dislocations will occur in the future or their duration.
              
    
    The
Company's and SCE&G's ability to draw on our respective bank revolving
credit facilities is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to
the facilities to meet their funding commitments and our ability to timely renew
such facilities. Those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments
to the Company or SCE&G if they experience shortages of capital and
liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from us
and other borrowers within a short period of time.  Longer term
disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty,
changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives or failures of
significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to
liquidity needed for our businesses. Any disruption could require the Company
and SCE&G to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or
until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs
can be arranged. Such measures could include deferring capital expenditures or
other discretionary uses of cash.  Disruptions in capital and credit
markets also could result in higher interest rates on debt securities, limited
or no access to the commercial paper market, increased costs associated with
commercial paper borrowing or limitations on the maturities of commercial paper
that can be sold (if at all), increased costs under bank credit facilities and
reduced availability thereof, and increased costs for certain variable interest
rate debt securities of the Company and SCE&G.
    
    Disruptions
in the capital markets and its actual or perceived effects on particular
businesses and the greater economy also adversely affect the value of the
investments held within SCANA's pension trust. A significant long-term decline
in the value of these investments may require us to make or increase
contributions to the trust to meet future funding requirements. In addition, a
significant decline in the market value of the investments may adversely impact
SCANA's results of operations, cash flows and financial position, including its
shareholders' equity.
     
    
    SCANA
may not be able to maintain its leverage ratio at a level considered appropriate
by debt rating agencies. This could result in downgrades of SCANA's and
SCE&G’s debt ratings, thereby increasing their borrowing costs and adversely
affecting their results of operations, cash flows and financial
condition.
      
    SCANA's
leverage ratio of debt to capital was approximately 59% at December 31,
2009.  SCANA has publicly announced its desire to reduce its present
leverage ratio to levels between 54% and 57%, but SCANA's ability to do so
depends on a number of factors. In the future, if SCANA is not able to reduce
its leverage ratio, and maintain it within the desired range, SCANA's and
SCE&G’s debt ratings may be affected, they may be required to pay higher
interest rates on their long- and short-term indebtedness, and their access to
the capital markets may be limited.
     
     
    A
downgrade in the credit rating of SCANA or any of SCANA’s subsidiaries,
including SCE&G, could negatively affect their ability to access capital and
to operate their businesses, thereby adversely affecting results of operations,
cash flows and financial condition.
     
    Standard &
Poor's Ratings Services (S&P), Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) and Fitch
Ratings (Fitch) rate SCANA's long-term senior unsecured debt at BBB, Baa2 and
BBB+, respectively.  These ratings agencies rate SCANA’s junior
subordinated debt (Hybrid) securities at BBB-, Baa3 and BBB-,
respectively.  S&P, Moody's and Fitch rate SCE&G's long-term
senior secured debt at A-, A3 and A, respectively.  S&P, Moody’s and
Fitch rate the long-term senior unsecured debt of Public Service Company of
North Carolina, Incorporated (PSNC Energy) at BBB+, A3 and A-,
respectively.  Moody’s carries a negative outlook on each of its
ratings.  S&P and Fitch carry a stable outlook on each of their
ratings.  If S&P, Moody's or Fitch were to downgrade any of these
long-term ratings, particularly to below investment grade, borrowing costs would
increase, which would diminish financial results, and the potential pool of
investors and funding sources could decrease.  Should the ratings on
the hybrid securities at SCANA decline below investment grade, SCANA will be
required to redeem such securities [IS THIS TRUE?]or take other prescribed
remedial actions.  S&P, Moody's and Fitch rate the short-term debt
of SCE&G and PSNC Energy at A-2, P-2 and F-2, respectively. If these
short-term ratings were to decline, it could significantly limit access to
sources of liquidity.
     
     
    Operating
results may be adversely affected by abnormal weather.
     
    The
Company and SCE&G have historically sold less power, delivered less gas and
received lower prices for natural gas in deregulated markets, and consequently
earned less income, when weather conditions have been milder than normal. Mild
weather in the future could diminish the revenues and results of operations and
harm the financial condition of the Company and SCE&G. In addition, severe
weather can be destructive, causing outages and property damage, adversely
affecting operating expenses and revenues.

    Potential
competitive changes may adversely affect our gas and electricity businesses due
to the loss of customers, reductions in revenues, or write-down of stranded
assets.
     
    The
utility industry has been undergoing dramatic structural change for several
years, resulting in increasing competitive pressures on electric and natural gas
utility companies. Competition in wholesale power sales has been introduced on a
national level. Some states have also mandated or encouraged competition at the
retail level. Increased competition may create greater risks to the stability of
utility earnings generally and may in the future reduce earnings from retail
electric and natural gas sales. In a deregulated environment, formerly regulated
utility companies that are not responsive to a competitive energy marketplace
may suffer erosion in market share, revenues and profits as competitors gain
access to their customers. In addition, SCANA's and SCE&G's generation
assets would be exposed to considerable financial risk in a deregulated electric
market. If market prices for electric generation do not produce adequate revenue
streams and the enabling legislation or regulatory actions do not provide for
recovery of the resulting stranded costs, a write-down in the value of the
related assets would be required.
     
    The
Company and SCE&G are subject to risks associated with changes in business
and economic climate which could adversely affect revenues, results of
operations, cash flows and financial condition and could limit access to
capital.
     
    Sales,
sales growth and customer usage patterns are dependent upon the economic climate
in the service territories of the Company and SCE&G, which may be affected
by regional, national or even international economic factors. Some economic
sectors important to our customer base may be particularly affected. Adverse
events, economic or otherwise, may also affect the operations of key
customers.  Such events may result in the loss of customers, changes
in customer usage patterns and in the failure of customers to make timely
payments to us. The success of local and state governments in attracting new
industry to our service territories is important to our sales and growth in
sales, as are stable levels of taxation (including property, income or other
taxes) which may be affected by local, state, or federal budget deficits,
adverse economic climates generally or legislative or regulatory
actions.
      
    In addition, conservation efforts
and/or technological advances may cause or enable customers to significantly
reduce their usage of the Company’s and SCE&G’s products and adversely
affect sales, sales growth, and customer usage patterns.
    
    Factors
that generally could affect our ability to access capital include economic
conditions and our capital structure. Much of our business is capital intensive,
and achievement of our capital plan and long-term growth targets is dependent,
at least in part, upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we
determine to be attractive. If our ability to access capital becomes
significantly constrained, our interest costs will likely increase and our
financial condition and future results of operations could be significantly
harmed.
     
     
    Problems
with operations could cause us to curtail or limit our ability to serve
customers or cause us to incur substantial costs, thereby adversely impacting
revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial
condition.
     
     Critical processes or systems in
the Company’s or SCE&G’s operations could become impaired or fail from a
variety of causes, such as equipment breakdown, transmission line failure,
information systems failure or security breach, the effects of drought
(including reduced water levels) on the operation of emission control or other
generation equipment, and the effects of a pandemic or terrorist attack on our
workforce or facilities or on the ability of vendors and suppliers to maintain
services key to our operations.  
     
    In
particular, as the operator of power generation facilities, SCE&G could
incur problems such as the breakdown or failure of power generation or emission
control equipment, transmission lines, other equipment or processes which would
result in performance below assumed levels of output or efficiency. In addition,
any such breakdown or failure may result in SCE&G purchasing emissions
credits or replacement power at market rates, if such replacement power is
available at all. If replacement power is not available, such problems could
result in interruptions of service (blackout or brownout conditions) in all or
part of SCE&G’s territory or elsewhere in the region. These purchases are
subject to state regulatory prudency reviews for recovery through
rates.
     
     
    Covenants
in certain financial instruments may limit SCANA's ability to pay dividends,
thereby adversely impacting the valuation of our common stock and our access to
capital.
     
    Our
assets consist primarily of investments in subsidiaries. Dividends on our common
stock depend on the earnings, financial condition and capital requirements of
our subsidiaries, principally SCE&G, PSNC Energy and SCANA Energy Marketing,
Inc. (SEMI). Our ability to pay dividends on our common stock may also be
limited by existing or future covenants limiting the right of our subsidiaries
to pay dividends on their common stock. Any significant reduction in our payment
of dividends in the future may result in a decline in the value of our common
stock. Such a decline in value could limit our ability to raise debt and equity
capital.

        Table of ContentsA
significant portion of SCE&G's generating capacity is derived from nuclear
power, the use of which exposes us to regulatory, environmental and business
risks. These risks could increase our costs or otherwise constrain our business,
thereby adversely impacting our results of operations, cash flows and financial
condition.  These risks will increase as the New Units are
developed
    
     
     In 2009, the V.C. Summer Nuclear
Station, operated by SCE&G, provided approximately 4.6 million MWh, or
18 % of our generation capacity, both of which figures are expected to increase
if the New Units are completed. As such, SCE&G is subject to various risks
of nuclear generation, which include the following:
     
     
    
      

            
              ·

       materials in
connection with the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling
and disposal of
       radioactive
materials;

       in connection with our
nuclear operations or those of others in the United States;

      and
            
          
    
     
    
      

            
              ·  
            
            
              Uncertainties
      with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning
      nuclear plants at
            
          
    
       the end of their operating
lives.
     
                The
NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related
requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. In the event of
non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit,
or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until
compliance is achieved.  Revised safety requirements promulgated by
the NRC could necessitate capital expenditures at nuclear plants such as ours.
In addition, although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear
incident, if a major incident should occur at a domestic nuclear facility, it
could harm our results of operations, cash flows and financial
condition.  A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the
world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any
domestic nuclear unit. Finally, in today's environment, there is a heightened
risk of terrorist attack on the nation's nuclear facilities, which has resulted
in increased security costs at our nuclear plant.
     
    Failure
to retain and attract key personnel could adversely affect the Company’s and
SCE&G’s operations and financial performance.
     
     Implementation of our strategic
plan and growth strategy requires that we attract, retain and develop executive
officers and other professional, technical and craft employees with the skills
and experience necessary to successfully manage, operate and grow our business.
Competition for these employees is high, and in some cases we must compete for
these employees on a regional or national basis. We may be unable to attract and
retain these personnel. Further, the Company’s or SCE&G’s ability to
construct or maintain generation or other assets requires the availability of
suitable skilled contractor personnel. We may be unable to obtain appropriate
contractor personnel at the times and places needed.  Labor disputes
with employees or contractors covered by collective bargaining agreements also
could adversely affect implementation of our strategic plan and our operational
and financial performance.
     
     
    The Company and
SCE&G are subject to the risk that strategic decisions made by us either do
not result in a return of or on invested capital or might negatively impact our
competitive position, which can adversely impact our results of operations, cash
flows, financial position, and access to capital.
     
     From time to time, the Company
and SCE&G make strategic decisions that may impact our direction with regard
to business opportunities, the services and technologies offered to customers or
that are used to serve customers, and the generating plant and other
infrastructure that form the basis of much of our business. These strategic
decisions may not result in a return of or on our invested capital, and the
effects of these strategic decisions may have long-term implications that are
not likely to be known to us in the short-term. Changing political climates and
public attitudes may adversely affect the ongoing acceptability of strategic
decisions that have been made (and, in some cases, previously approved by
regulators), to the detriment of the Company or SCE&G.  Over time,
these strategic decisions or changing attitudes toward such decisions, which
could be adverse to the Company’s or SCE&G’s interests, may have a negative
effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position, as well
as limit our ability to access capital.
