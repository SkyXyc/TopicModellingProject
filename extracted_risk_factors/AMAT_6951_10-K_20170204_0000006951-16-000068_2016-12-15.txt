:Risk FactorsThe following risk factors could materially and adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition or results of operations and cause reputational harm, and should be carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its business, in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report.The industries that Applied serves can be volatile and difficult to predict.As a supplier to the global semiconductor and display and related industries, Applied is subject to business cycles, the timing, length and volatility of which can be difficult to predict and which vary among its businesses. These industries historically have been cyclical and are subject to volatility and sudden changes in customer requirements for new manufacturing capacity and advanced technology, which depend on several factors, including general economic conditions, end-user demand, customers’ capacity utilization, production volumes, access to affordable capital, consumer buying patterns, inventory levels relative to demand, and technology transitions. These changes can affect the timing and amounts of customer investments in technology and manufacturing equipment, and can have a significant impact on Applied’s net sales, operating expenses, gross margins and net income. The amount and mix of capital equipment spending between different products and technologies can have a significant impact on the results of operations of Applied’s Semiconductor Systems segment, which is the largest contributor to its consolidated net sales.To meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves, Applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity across its businesses, and may incur unexpected or additional costs to align its business operations. During periods of increasing demand for its products, Applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand; effectively manage its supply chain; attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees; and continue to control costs. During periods of decreasing demand, Applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions; effectively manage its supply chain; and motivate and retain key employees. If Applied does not effectively manage these challenges during periods of changing demand, its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted. Even with effective allocation of resources and management of costs, during periods of decreasing demand, Applied’s gross margins and earnings may be adversely impacted.Applied is exposed to risks associated with an uncertain global economy.Uncertain global economic and business conditions, along with uncertainties in the financial markets, national debt and fiscal concerns in various regions, pose challenges to the industries in which Applied operates. Markets for semiconductors and displays depend largely on business and consumer spending and demand for electronic products. Economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain Applied customers to push out, cancel, or refrain from purchasing for equipment or services, which may have an adverse impact on Applied’s revenues, results of operations and financial condition. Uncertain market conditions, difficulties in obtaining capital, or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, which can also result in lower sales, additional inventory or bad debt expense for Applied. Economic and industry uncertainty may similarly affect suppliers, which could impair their ability to deliver parts and negatively affect Applied’s ability to manage operations and deliver its products. These conditions may also lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect Applied’s ability to compete effectively.Uncertain economic and industry conditions also make it more challenging for Applied to forecast its operating results, make business decisions, and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses, sources and uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations. If Applied does not appropriately manage its business operations, it could have a significant negative impact on its business performance and financial condition. Applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts, including restructuring activities, which may adversely affect Applied’s ability to capitalize on opportunities. Even during periods of economic uncertainty or lower revenues, Applied must continue to invest in research and development and maintain a global business infrastructure to compete effectively and support its customers, which can have a negative impact on its operating margins and earnings.Applied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. The risks to Applied’s investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate and, as a result, the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio, as well as returns on pension assets, could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges. Applied also maintains cash balances in various bank accounts globally in order to fund normal operations. If any of these financial institutions becomes insolvent, it could limit Applied’s ability to access cash in the affected accounts, which could affect its ability to manage its operations.14Table of ContentsApplied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the various industries in which it operates.The global semiconductor, display and related industries in which Applied operates are characterized by ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries that impact demand for and the profitability of Applied’s products, including:•the nature, timing and degree of visibility of changes in end demand for electronic products, including those related to fluctuations in consumer buying patterns tied to seasonality or the introduction of new products, and the effects of these changes on foundry and other customers’ businesses and on demand for Applied’s products;•increasing capital requirements for building and operating new fabrication plants and customers’ ability to raise the necessary capital;•regulatory or tax policies impacting the timing of customers’ investment in new or expanded fabrication plants;•differences in growth rates among the semiconductor, display and other industries in which Applied operates;•the increasing importance of establishing, improving and maintaining strong relationships with customers;•the increasing cost and complexity for customers to move from product design to volume manufacturing, which may slow the adoption rate of new manufacturing technology;•the need for customers to continually reduce the total cost of manufacturing system ownership;•the heightened importance to customers of system reliability and productivity and the effect on demand for fabrication systems as a result of their increasing productivity, device yield and reliability;•manufacturers’ ability to reconfigure and re-use fabrication systems which can reduce demand for new equipment;•the increasing importance of, and difficulties in, developing products with sufficient differentiation to influence customers’ purchasing decisions;•requirements for shorter cycle times for the development, manufacture and installation of manufacturing equipment;•price and performance trends for semiconductor devices and displays, and the corresponding effect on demand for such products;•the increasing importance of the availability of spare parts to maximize the time that customers’ systems are available for production;•the increasing role for and complexity of software in Applied products; and•the increasing focus on reducing energy usage and improving the environmental impact and sustainability associated with manufacturing operations.Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the semiconductor industry.The largest proportion of Applied’s consolidated net sales and profitability is derived from sales of manufacturing equipment in the Semiconductor Systems segment to the global semiconductor industry. In addition, a majority of the revenues of Applied Global Services is from sales to semiconductor manufacturers. The semiconductor industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of Applied’s semiconductor equipment and service products, including:•the increasing cost of research and development due to many factors, including decreasing linewidths on a chip, the use of new materials, new and more complex device structures, more applications and process steps, increasing chip design costs, and the increasing cost and complexity of integrated manufacturing processes;•the need to reduce product development time, despite the increasing difficulty of technical challenges;•the growing number of types and varieties of semiconductors and number of applications across multiple substrate sizes;•the increasing cost and complexity for semiconductor manufacturers to move more technically advanced capability and smaller linewidths to volume manufacturing, and the resulting impact on the rates of technology transition and investment in capital equipment;•challenges in generating organic growth given semiconductor manufacturers’ levels of capital expenditures  and the allocation of capital investment to market segments that Applied does not serve, such as lithography, or segments where Applied’s products have lower relative market presence;•the importance of increasing market positions in segments with growing demand;•semiconductor manufacturer’s ability to reconfigure and re-use equipment, and the resulting effect on their need to purchase new equipment and services;15Table of Contents•the increasing frequency and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, such as 3-D transistors and advanced interconnects, and Applied’s ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes;•shorter cycle times between order placements by customers and product shipment require greater reliance on forecasting of customer investment, which may lead to inventory write-offs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease gross margin;•competitive factors that make it difficult to enhance position, including challenges in securing development-tool-of-record (DTOR) and production-tool-of-record (PTOR) positions with customers;•consolidation in the semiconductor industry, including among semiconductor manufacturers and among manufacturing equipment suppliers;•shifts in sourcing strategies by computer and electronics companies that impact the equipment requirements of Applied’s foundry customers;•the concentration of new wafer starts in Korea and Taiwan, where Applied’s service penetration and service-revenue-per-wafer-start have been lower than in other regions; •investment in semiconductor manufacturing capabilities in China, and its effect on the demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment; and•the increasing fragmentation of semiconductor markets, leading certain markets to become too small to support the cost of a new fabrication plant, while others require less technologically advanced products.If Applied does not accurately forecast, and allocate appropriate resources and investment towards addressing, key technology changes and inflections, successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new technologies, and effectively address industry trends, its business and results of operations may be adversely impacted.Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the display industry.The global display industry historically has experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment investment levels, due in part to the limited number of display manufacturers, the concentrated nature of end-use applications, production capacity relative to end-use demand, and panel manufacturer profitability. Industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced TVs, and on demand for advanced smartphones and mobile device displays, which demand is highly sensitive to cost and improvements in technologies and features. The display industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of Applied’s display products, including:•the importance of new types of display technologies, such as organic light-emitting diode (OLED), low temperature polysilicon (LTPS), flexible displays and metal oxide, and new touch panel films;•the timing and extent of an expansion of manufacturing facilities in China, which may be affected by changes in economic conditions in China;•the rate of transition to larger substrate sizes for TVs and to new display technologies for TVs and mobile applications, and the resulting effect on capital intensity in the industry and on Applied’s product differentiation, gross margin and return on investment; and•the variability in demand for display manufacturing equipment, and uncertainty with respect to future display technology end-use applications and growth drivers.If Applied does not successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new and emerging display technologies, or if industry demand for display manufacturing equipment and technologies slows, Applied’s business and its results of operations may be adversely impacted.The industries in which Applied operates are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market changes.Applied operates in a highly competitive environment in which innovation is critical, and its future success depends on many factors, including the development of new technologies and effective commercialization and customer acceptance of its equipment, services and related products. In order to successfully grow its businesses, Applied must increase its position in its current markets, expand into adjacent and new markets, and optimize operational performance. The development, introduction and support of a broadening set of products in a geographically diverse and competitive environment, and that may require greater collaboration with customers and other industry participants, have grown more complex and expensive over time. Furthermore, new or improved products may entail higher costs and lower profits. To compete successfully, Applied must:16Table of Contents•identify and address technology inflections, market changes, new applications, customer requirements and end-use demand;•develop new products and disruptive technologies, improve and develop new applications for existing products, and adapt products for use by customers in different applications and markets with varying technical requirements;•differentiate its products from those of competitors, meet customers’ performance specifications, appropriately price products, and achieve market acceptance;•maintain operating flexibility to enable responses to changing markets, applications, customers and customer requirements;•enhance its worldwide operations across its businesses to reduce cycle time, enable continuous quality improvement, reduce costs, and enhance design for manufacturability and serviceability;•focus on product development and sales and marketing strategies that address customers’ high value problems and strengthen customer relationships;•effectively allocate resources between its existing products and markets, the development of new products, and expanding into new and adjacent markets;•improve the productivity of capital invested in R&D activities;•accurately forecast demand, work with suppliers and meet production schedules for its products;•improve its manufacturing processes and achieve cost efficiencies across product offerings;•adapt to changes in value offered by companies in different parts of the supply chain;•qualify products for evaluation and volume manufacturing with its customers; and •implement changes in its design engineering methodology to reduce material costs and cycle time, increase commonality of platforms and types of parts used in different systems, and improve product life cycle management.If Applied does not successfully anticipate technology inflections, develop and commercialize new products and technologies, and respond to changes in customer requirements and market trends, its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted.Applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base.Applied’s customer base is highly concentrated, and has become increasingly concentrated as a result of continued consolidation.  Applied’s customer base is also geographically concentrated. A relatively limited number of manufacturers account for a substantial portion of Applied’s business. As a result, the actions of even a single customer can expose Applied’s business and results of operations to greater volatility. The mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year, and have a significant impact on Applied’s net sales, gross margins and net income.  Applied’s products are configured to customer specifications, and changing, rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant, non-recoverable costs. If customers do not place orders, or they substantially reduce, delay or cancel orders, Applied may not be able to replace the business, which may have a significant adverse impact on its results of operations and financial condition.  The concentration of Applied’s customer base increases its risks related to the financial condition of its customers, and the deterioration in financial condition of a single customer or the failure of a single customer to perform its obligations could have a material adverse effect on Applied’s results of operations and cash flow. To the extent its customers experience liquidity constraints, Applied may incur additional bad debt expense, which may have a significant impact on its results of operations. Major customers may also seek pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to Applied, which may have a negative impact on Applied’s business, revenue and gross margins. Applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business.Applied has product development, engineering, manufacturing, sales and other operations in many countries, and some of its business activities are concentrated in certain geographic areas. Moreover, in fiscal 2016, approximately 89 percent of Applied’s net sales were to customers in regions outside the United States. As a result of the global nature of its operations, Applied’s business performance and results of operations may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:•varying regional economic and geopolitical business conditions and demands;17Table of Contents•political and social attitudes, laws, rules, regulations and policies within countries that favor domestic companies over non-domestic companies, including customer- or government-supported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors;•customer- or government-supported efforts to influence Applied to conduct more of its operations and sourcing in a particular country, such as Korea and China;•variations among, and changes in, local, regional, national or international laws and regulations, including contract, intellectual property, labor, tax, and import/export laws, and the interpretation and application of such laws and regulations;•global trade issues, including the ability to obtain required import and export licenses, and international trade disputes;•ineffective or inadequate legal protection of intellectual property rights in certain countries;•positions taken by governmental agencies regarding possible national commercial and/or security issues posed by international business operations;•fluctuating raw material, commodity, energy and shipping costs or shipping delays;•geographically diverse operations and projects, which require an effective organizational structure and allocation of resources, and appropriate business processes, procedures and controls;•supply chain interruptions, and service interruptions from utilities, transportation, data hosting or telecommunications providers;•a diverse workforce with different experience levels, languages, cultures, customs, business practices and worker expectations, and differing employment practices and labor issues;•variations in the ability to develop relationships with local customers, suppliers and governments;•fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates, including the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen, euro, Taiwanese dollar, Israeli shekel, Chinese yuan or Singapore dollar;•the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations around the world;•political instability, natural disasters, pandemics, social unrest, terrorism or acts of war in locations where Applied has operations, suppliers or sales, or that may influence the value chain of the industries that Applied serves;•hiring and integration of an increasing number of workers in new countries;•the increasing need for a mobile workforce to work in or travel to different regions; and•uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various countries, including for the manufacture and sale of semiconductors and displays in the developing economies of certain countries.Many of these challenges are present in China and Korea, which are experiencing significant growth of customers, suppliers and competitors to Applied. Applied further believes that China and Korea present large potential markets for its products and opportunity for growth over the long term, although at lower projected levels of profitability and margins for certain products than historically have been achieved in other regions. In addition, government authorities may impose conditions that require the use of local suppliers or partnerships with local companies, require the license or other transfer of intellectual property, or engage in other efforts to promote local businesses and local competitors, which could have a significant adverse impact on Applied’s business. Applied is exposed to risks associated with business combinations, acquisitions and strategic investments.Applied engages in acquisitions of or investments in companies, technologies or products in existing, related or new markets for Applied. Business combinations, acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks to Applied’s business, financial condition and operating results, including but not limited to:•diversion of management’s attention and disruption of ongoing businesses;•contractual restrictions on the conduct of Applied’s business during the pendency of a proposed transaction;•inability to complete proposed transactions due to the failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals, litigation or other disputes, and any ensuing obligation to pay a termination fee;•the failure to realize expected returns from acquired businesses;•requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures and restrictions on the conduct of Applied’s existing business or the acquired business;•ineffective integration of operations, systems, technologies, products or employees, which can impact the ability to realize anticipated synergies or other benefits;18Table of Contents•failure to commercialize technologies from acquired businesses or developed through strategic investments;•dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners;•inability to capitalize on characteristics of new markets that may be significantly different from Applied’s existing markets and where competitors may have stronger market positions and customer relationships;•failure to retain and motivate key employees of acquired businesses;•the potential impact of the announcement or consummation of a proposed transaction on relationships with third parties;•potential changes in Applied’s credit rating, which could adversely impact the Company’s access to and cost of capital;•reductions in cash balances or increases in debt obligations to finance activities associated with a transaction, which reduce the availability of cash flow for general corporate or other purposes, including share repurchases and dividends;•exposure to new operational risks, rules, regulations, worker expectations, customs and practices to the extent acquired businesses are located in regions where Applied has not historically conducted business;•challenges associated with managing new, more diverse and more widespread operations, projects and people;•inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in key technologies;•inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company’s internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices;•impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the segment;•the risk of litigation or claims associated with a proposed or completed transaction;•unknown, underestimated or undisclosed commitments or liabilities; and•the inappropriate scale of acquired entities’ critical resources or facilities for business needs.Applied also makes strategic investments in other companies, including companies formed as joint ventures, which may decline in value or not meet desired objectives. The success of these investments depends on various factors over which Applied may have limited or no control and, particularly with respect to joint ventures, requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic partners. The risks to Applied’s strategic investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions and, as a result, the value of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges. Applied’s indebtedness and debt covenants could adversely affect its financial condition and business.Applied has $3.4 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding. Under the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes, it may be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon a change of control of Applied and a contemporaneous downgrade of the notes below investment grade. Applied also has in place a $1.5 billion committed revolving credit agreement. While no amounts were outstanding under this credit agreement at October 30, 2016, Applied may borrow amounts in the future under the agreement. Applied may also enter into new financing arrangements. Applied’s ability to satisfy its debt obligations is dependent upon the results of its business operations and subject to other risks discussed in this section. Significant changes in Applied’s credit rating or changes in the interest rate environment could have a material adverse consequence on Applied’s access to and cost of capital for future financings, and financial condition. If Applied fails to satisfy its debt obligations, or comply with financial and other debt covenants, it may be in default and any borrowings may become immediately due and payable, and such default may also constitute a default under other of Applied’s obligations. There can be no assurance that Applied would have sufficient financial resources or be able to arrange financing to repay any borrowings at such time. Applied is exposed to risks associated with expanding into new and related markets and industries.As part of its growth strategy, Applied must successfully expand into related or new markets and industries, either with its existing products or with new products developed internally, or those developed in collaboration with third parties, or obtained through acquisitions. Applied’s ability to successfully expand its business into new and related markets and industries may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:•the need to devote additional resources to develop new products for, and operate in, new markets;•the need to develop new sales and technical marketing strategies, cultivate relationships with new customers and meet different customer service requirements;19Table of Contents•differing rates of profitability and growth among multiple businesses;•Applied’s ability to anticipate demand, capitalize on opportunities, and avoid or minimize risks;•the complexity of managing multiple businesses with variations in production planning, execution, supply chain management and logistics;•the adoption of new business models, business processes and systems;•the complexity of entering into and effectively managing strategic alliances or partnering opportunities;•new materials, processes and technologies;•the need to attract, motivate and retain employees with skills and expertise in these new areas;•new and more diverse customers and suppliers, including some with limited operating histories, uncertain or limited funding, evolving business models or locations in regions where Applied does not have, or has limited, operations;•new or different competitors with potentially more financial or other resources, industry experience and established customer relationships;•entry into new industries and countries, with differing levels of government involvement, laws and regulations, and business, employment and safety practices;•third parties’ intellectual property rights; and•the need to comply with, or work to establish, industry standards and practices.In addition, Applied from time to time receives funding from United States and other government agencies for certain strategic development programs to increase its research and development resources and address new market opportunities. As a condition to this government funding, Applied may be subject to certain record-keeping, audit, intellectual property rights-sharing and/or other obligations.Manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect Applied’s ability to meet customer demand and lead to higher costs, while the failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory.Applied’s business depends on its timely supply of equipment, services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of its customers, which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts, including components and subassemblies, from suppliers, including contract manufacturers. Some key parts are subject to long lead-times or obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers, and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the countries where Applied conducts its manufacturing, including China and Korea. Variable industry conditions and the volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase capital, technical, operational and other risks for Applied and for companies throughout its supply chain. These conditions may cause some suppliers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other companies, or file for bankruptcy protection and possibly cease operations. Applied may also experience significant interruptions of its manufacturing operations, delays in its ability to deliver products or services, increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of:•the failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver sufficient quantities of quality parts on a cost-effective basis;•volatility in the availability and cost of materials, including rare earth elements;•difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals;•shipment delays due to transportation interruptions or capacity constraints;•information technology or infrastructure failures; and•natural disasters or other events beyond Applied’s control (such as earthquakes, floods or storms, regional economic downturns, pandemics, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war), particularly where it conducts manufacturing.If a supplier fails to meet Applied’s requirements concerning quality, cost, protection of intellectual property, socially-responsible business practices, or other performance factors, Applied may transfer its business to alternative sources, which could entail manufacturing delays, additional costs, or other difficulties. If Applied is unable to meet its customers’ demand for a prolonged period due to its inability to obtain certain parts or components, it could affect its ability to manage its operations, and have an adverse impact on Applied’s business, results of operations and customer relationships. In addition, if Applied needs to rapidly increase its business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules, this may exacerbate any interruptions in Applied’s manufacturing operations and supply chain and the associated effect on Applied’s working capital. Moreover, if actual demand for Applied’s products is different than expected, Applied may purchase more/fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or expediting delivery of parts. If Applied purchases inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize, or if customers reduce or delay orders, Applied may incur excess inventory charges. 20Table of ContentsThe ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital to Applied’s success.Applied’s success, competitiveness and ability to execute on its global strategies and maintain a culture of innovation depend in large part on its ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, management changes, Applied’s organizational structure, global competition for talent and the availability of qualified employees, cost reduction activities (including workforce reductions and unpaid shutdowns), availability of career development opportunities, the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries, and the effectiveness of Applied’s compensation and benefit programs, including its share-based programs. Restructuring programs present particular challenges to the extent they involve the departure of knowledgeable and experienced employees and the resulting need to identify and train existing or new workers to perform necessary functions, which may result in unexpected costs, reduced productivity, and/or difficulties with respect to internal processes and controls.Applied is exposed to various risks related to protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights.Applied’s success depends in significant part on the protection of its patents, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights. Infringement of Applied’s rights by a third party, such as the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts, could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for Applied. Policing any unauthorized use of intellectual property is difficult and costly and Applied cannot be certain that the measures it has implemented will prevent misuse. Applied’s ability to enforce its intellectual property rights is subject to litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the protection and enforceability of those rights in some countries. If Applied seeks to enforce its intellectual property rights, it may be subject to claims that those rights are invalid or unenforceable, and others may seek counterclaims against Applied, which could have a negative impact on its business. If Applied is unable to enforce and protect intellectual property rights, or if they are circumvented, invalidated, rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, it could have an adverse impact on its competitive position and business. In addition, changes in intellectual property laws or their interpretation, such as recent changes in U.S. patent laws, may impact Applied’s ability to protect and assert its intellectual property rights, increase costs and uncertainties in the prosecution of patent applications and enforcement or defense of issued patents, and diminish the value of Applied’s intellectual property.Third parties may also assert claims against Applied and its products. Claims that Applied’s products infringe the rights of others, whether or not meritorious, can be expensive and time-consuming to defend and resolve, and may divert the efforts and attention of management and personnel. The inability to obtain rights to use third party intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could have an adverse impact on Applied’s business. In addition, Applied may face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets and other confidential business information. Any such incidents and claims could severely harm Applied’s business and reputation, result in significant expenses, harm its competitive position, and prevent Applied from selling certain products, all of which could have a significant adverse impact on Applied’s business and results of operations.   Applied is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and incidents.In the conduct of its business, Applied collects, uses, transmits and stores data on information technology systems. This data includes confidential information belonging to Applied or its customers or other business partners, as well as personally-identifiable information of individuals. Applied has experienced, and expects to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents, ranging from employee error or misuse to individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, none of which have been material to the Company to date. Applied devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and other measures to protect its systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse. However, depending on their nature and scope, cybersecurity incidents could result in business disruption; the misappropriation, corruption or loss of confidential information and critical data (Applied’s and that of third parties); reputational damage; litigation with third parties; diminution in the value of Applied’s investment in research, development and engineering; data privacy issues; and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs.Applied is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings.Applied from time to time is, and in the future may be, involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement, intellectual property rights, antitrust, environmental regulations, securities, contracts, product performance, product liability, unfair competition, misappropriation of trade secrets, employment, workplace safety, and other matters. Applied also on occasion receives notification from customers who believe that Applied owes them indemnification or other obligations related to claims made against such customers by third parties.Legal proceedings and claims, whether with or without merit, and associated internal investigations, may be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct; divert management’s attention and other Applied resources; inhibit Applied’s ability to sell its products; result in adverse judgments for damages, injunctive relief, penalties and fines; and negatively affect Applied’s business. There can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings, claims or investigations. 21Table of ContentsThe failure to successfully implement and conduct outsourcing activities and other operational initiatives could adversely affect results of operations.To better align its costs with market conditions, locate closer to customers, enhance productivity, and improve efficiencies, Applied conducts certain engineering, software development, manufacturing, sourcing and other operations in regions outside the United States, including India, Taiwan, China, and Korea. Applied has implemented a distributed manufacturing model, under which certain manufacturing and supply chain activities are conducted in various countries, including Germany, Israel, Italy,  Singapore, Taiwan, the United States and other countries in Asia, and assembly of some systems is completed at customer sites. In addition, Applied outsources certain functions to third parties, including companies in the United States, India, China, Korea, Malaysia and other countries. Outsourced functions include contract manufacturing, engineering, customer support, software development, information technology support, finance and administrative activities. The expanding role of third party providers has required changes to Applied’s existing operations and the adoption of new procedures and processes for retaining and managing these providers, as well as redistributing responsibilities as warranted, in order to realize the potential productivity and operational efficiencies, assure quality and continuity of supply, and protect the intellectual property of Applied and its customers, suppliers and other partners. If Applied does not accurately forecast the amount, timing and mix of demand for products, or if contract manufacturers or other outsource providers fail to perform in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, Applied’s ability to meet customer requirements could suffer, particularly during a market upturn.In addition, Applied must regularly implement or update comprehensive programs and processes to better align its global organizations, including initiatives to enhance its supply chain and improve back office and information technology infrastructure for more efficient transaction processing. The implementation of new processes and information systems and additional functionality to the existing systems entails certain risks, including difficulties with changes in business processes that could disrupt Applied’s operations, such as its ability to track orders and timely ship products, project inventory requirements, manage its supply chain and aggregate financial and operational data. During transitions Applied must continue to rely on legacy information systems, which may be costly or inefficient, while the implementation of new initiatives may not achieve the anticipated benefits and may divert management’s attention from other operational activities, or have other unintended consequences.If Applied does not effectively develop and implement its outsourcing and relocation strategies, if required export and other governmental approvals are not timely obtained, if Applied’s third party providers do not perform as anticipated, if there are delays or difficulties in enhancing business processes or if there are delays or difficulties in implementing or enhancing information systems, Applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies, and may experience operational difficulties, increased costs (including energy and transportation), manufacturing interruptions or delays, inefficiencies in the structure and/or operation of its supply chain, loss of its intellectual property rights, quality issues, reputational harm, increased product time-to-market, and/or inefficient allocation of human resources, all of which could adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Applied may incur impairment charges to goodwill or long-lived assets.Applied has a significant amount of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions. Goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The review compares the fair value for each of Applied’s reporting units to its associated carrying value, including goodwill. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, declines in the market price of Applied common stock, changes in Applied’s strategies or product portfolio, and restructuring activities. Applied’s valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance. Applied may be required to record future charges to earnings during the period in which an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets is determined to exist.Applied is exposed to risks associated with operating in jurisdictions with complex and changing tax laws.Applied is subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities. Applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in: (1) applicable tax laws; (2) amount and composition of pre-tax income in jurisdictions with differing tax rates; (3) plans to indefinitely reinvest certain funds held outside of the U.S.; and (4) valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. An increase in Applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on Applied’s results of operations and financial condition. As of October 30, 2016, Applied intends to indefinitely reinvest approximately $3.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries and does not plan to repatriate these funds.  Applied would need to accrue and pay U.S. taxes if these funds were repatriated.22Table of ContentsConsistent with the international nature of its business, Applied conducts certain manufacturing, supply chain, and other operations in Asia, bringing these activities closer to customers and reducing operating costs. In certain foreign jurisdictions, conditional reduced income tax rates have been granted to Applied. To obtain the benefit of these tax incentives, Applied must meet requirements relating to various activities. Applied’s ability to realize benefits from these incentives could be materially affected if, among other things, applicable requirements are not met or Applied incurs net losses in these jurisdictions.In addition, Applied is subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and from time to time amends previously filed tax returns. Applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes, which requires estimates and judgments. Although Applied believes its tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the tax authorities will agree with such estimates. Applied may have to engage in litigation to achieve the results reflected in the estimates, which may be time-consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance that Applied will be successful or that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in Applied’s historical income tax provisions and effective tax rates.Applied is subject to risks associated with environmental and safety regulations.Applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in connection with its global business operations, including but not limited to: regulations related to the development, manufacture and use of its products; handling, discharge, recycling and disposal of hazardous materials used in its products or in producing its products; the operation of its facilities; and the use of its real property. The failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental and safety regulations could result in: significant remediation or other legal liabilities; the imposition of penalties and fines; restrictions on the development, manufacture, sale or use of certain of its products; limitations on the operation of its facilities or ability to use its real property; and a decrease in the value of its real property. Applied could be required to alter its manufacturing and operations and incur substantial expense in order to comply with environmental and safety regulations. Any failure to comply with environmental and safety regulations could subject Applied to significant costs and liabilities that could adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Applied is exposed to various risks related to the global regulatory environment.As a public company with global operations, Applied is subject to the laws of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions, including those related to financial and other disclosures, corporate governance, intellectual property, tax, trade, anti-competition, employment, immigration, privacy, and anti-corruption. Changing, inconsistent or conflicting laws, rules and regulations, and ambiguities in their interpretation and application, create uncertainty and challenges, and compliance with laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive, divert management time and attention from revenue-generating activities, and otherwise adversely impact Applied’s business operations. Violations of law, rules and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions, restrictions on Applied’s business, and damage to its reputation, and could have an adverse impact on its business operations, financial condition and results of operations.
