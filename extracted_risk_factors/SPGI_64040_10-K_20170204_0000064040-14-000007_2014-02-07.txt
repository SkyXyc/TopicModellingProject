Item 1a. Risk FactorsWe are providing the following cautionary statements which identify all known material risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical and expected results.We operate in the capital, commodities and commercial markets. The capital markets include asset managers, banks, exchanges, issuers and financial advisors; the commodities markets include producers, traders and intermediaries within energy, metals, and agriculture; and the commercial markets include professionals and corporate executives within construction and marketing / research information services. Certain risk factors are applicable to individual markets while other risk factors are applicable company-wide.Market RisksIntroduction of new products, services or technologies could impact our profitability•We operate in highly competitive markets that continue to change to adapt to customer needs. In order to maintain a competitive position, we must continue to invest in new offerings and new ways to deliver our products and services.  ◦These investments may not be profitable or may be less profitable than what we have experienced historically. •We could experience threats to our existing businesses from the rise of new competitors due to the rapidly changing environment within which we operate.  •We rely on our information technology environment and certain critical databases, systems and applications to support key product and service offerings. We believe we have appropriate policies, processes and internal controls to ensure the stability of our information technology, provide security from unauthorized access to our systems and maintain business continuity, but our business could be subject to significant disruption and our operating results may be adversely impacted by unanticipated system failures, data corruption or unauthorized access to our systems.Exposure to litigation could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations•We are involved in legal actions and claims arising from our business practices, as discussed under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in this Form 10-K and in Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this Form 10-K, and face the risk that additional actions and claims will be filed in the future. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process, the resolution of any actions or claims that may be brought in the future, or the change in applicable legal standards could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations. Changes in the volume of securities issued and traded in domestic and/or global capital markets and changes in interest rates and volatility in the financial markets could have a material impact on our results of operations•Unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers' willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuance for which S&P Ratings provides credit ratings.•Unfavorable financial or economic conditions could also adversely impact S&P DJ Indices, which receives a portion of its revenue from fees based on derivatives trading volumes and index-based ETF assets under management.•Increases in interest rates or credit spreads, volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment, significant political or economic events, defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance, the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers, the level of derivatives trading and/or the types of credit-sensitive products being offered.  •Any weakness in the macroeconomic environment could constrain customer budgets across the markets we serve, potentially leading to a reduction in their employee headcount and a decrease in demand for our subscription-based products.Increased domestic and foreign regulation may adversely impact our businesses•Our results could be adversely affected because of public statements or actions by market participants, government officials and others who may be advocates of increased regulation or regulatory scrutiny.•The financial services industry is subject to the potential for increasing regulation in the United States and abroad. The businesses conducted by S&P Ratings are in certain cases regulated under the U.S. Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 9Table of Contents2006, the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and/or the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they conduct business.  ◦In the past several years, the U.S. Congress, the SEC and the European Commission, through regulators including the International Organization of Securities Commissions and the European Securities and Markets Authority, as well as regulators in other countries in which S&P Ratings operates have been reviewing the role of rating agencies and their processes and the need for greater oversight or regulations concerning the issuance of credit ratings or the activities of credit rating agencies. ▪We do not believe that the laws, regulations and rules that have been adopted as part of this process will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  ◦Other laws, regulations and rules relating to credit rating agencies are being considered by local, national, foreign and multinational bodies and are likely to continue to be considered in the future, including provisions seeking to reduce regulatory and investor reliance on credit ratings, rotation of credit rating agencies and liability standards applicable to credit rating agencies. The impact on us of the adoption of any such laws, regulations or rules remains uncertain, but could increase the costs and legal risks relating to S&P Rating's rating activities.◦Additional information regarding rating agencies is provided under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in this Form 10-K.•Our commodities business is subject to the potential for increasing regulatory review in the United States and abroad. ◦In the fall of 2011, the G20 Cannes Final Summit Declaration called upon the International Organization of Securities Commissions ("IOSCO"), International Energy Forum, International Energy Agency and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to prepare recommendations to improve the functioning and oversight of price reporting companies by mid-2012.◦In a meeting with representatives of IOSCO in January 2012, principals at IOSCO advised Platts management that among the recommendations the regulatory group is considering is establishment of formal oversight of price reporting organizations and their processes, or a self-regulatory oversight regime.  ◦In addition, new rules adopted by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission in 2013 affecting transactions in oil derivatives may hinder Platts in relation to its administration of the Platts electronic window (eWindow) as a means of determining price assessments in oil. Similar new rules and regulations in Europe are currently under consideration, albeit on a slower time frame.◦On October 5, 2012, IOSCO issued its final report to the G-20, including Principles for Oil Price Reporting Agencies, which sets out principles IOSCO states are intended to enhance the reliability of oil price assessments that are referenced in derivative contracts subject to regulation by IOSCO members. Platts undertook steps to align its operations with the Principles including an assurance review by an external auditor and after doing so believes that the Principles will not have a significant negative impact on its ongoing business operations.◦We do not believe that any new regulatory or self-regulatory oversight regime would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.•The S&P DJ Indices business is subject to the potential for increasing regulatory review in the United States and abroad. ◦In July 2013, IOSCO issued its Principles for Financial Benchmarks, which is a set of principles intended to promote the reliability of Benchmark determinations, and address governance, Benchmark quality and accountability mechanisms, including with regard to the indices published by S&P DJ Indices.◦S&P DJ Indices is currently undertaking steps to ensure that its operations are aligned with the IOSCO Financial Benchmark Principles.  ◦We do not believe that any new regulatory or self-regulatory oversight regime would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Operating RisksA significant increase in operating costs and expenses could have a material adverse effect on our profitability•Our major expenses include employee compensation and capital investments.  ◦We offer competitive salary and benefit packages in order to attract and retain the quality employees required to grow and expand our businesses. Compensation costs are influenced by general economic factors, including 10Table of Contentsthose affecting the cost of health insurance and postretirement benefits, and any trends specific to the employee skill sets we require.  ◦We make significant investments in information technology data centers and other technology initiatives. Although we believe we are prudent in our investment strategies and execution of our implementation plans, there is no assurance as to the ultimate recoverability of these investments.Our ability to protect our intellectual property rights could impact our competitive position•Our products contain intellectual property delivered through a variety of media, including print and digital. Our ability to achieve anticipated results depends in part on our ability to defend our intellectual property against infringement. Our operating results may be adversely affected by inadequate or changing legal and technological protections for intellectual property and proprietary rights in some jurisdictions and markets. Risk of doing business abroad•As we continue to expand our operations overseas, we face the increased risks of doing business abroad, including inflation, fluctuation in interest rates and currency exchange rates, changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements, export and import restrictions, tariffs, nationalization, expropriation, limits on repatriation of funds, civil unrest, terrorism, unstable governments and legal systems, and other factors. Adverse developments in any of these areas could cause actual results to differ materially from historical and/or expected operating results.Increased competition could result in a loss of market share or revenue •The markets for credit ratings, financial research, investment and advisory services, and index-based products are competitive. S&P Ratings, S&P Capital IQ and S&P DJ Indices compete domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of factors, including the quality of its ratings, research and advisory services, client service, reputation, price, geographic scope, range of products and technological innovation.  •While our businesses face competition from traditional content and analytics providers, we also face competition from non-traditional providers such as exchanges, asset managers, investment banks and technology-led companies that are adding content and analytics capabilities to their core businesses.•In addition, in some of the countries in which S&P Ratings competes, governments may provide financial or other support to locally-based rating agencies and may from time to time establish official credit rating agencies, credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers.  Consolidation of customers as well as staffing levels across our customer base could impact our available markets and revenue growth•Our businesses within S&P Capital IQ and S&P DJ Indices have a customer base which is largely comprised of members from the financial services industry. The current challenging business environment and the consolidation of customers resulting from mergers and acquisitions in the financial services industry can result in reductions in the number of firms and workforce which can impact the size of our customer base.Changes to our financial processing systems and the transition of certain of our support functions to selected outsource providers may adversely impact our business•We are in the process of changing certain of our financial processing systems to an enterprise-wide systems solution. There can be no certainty that these initiatives will deliver the expected benefits. The failure to implement these changes successfully may impact our ability to process transactions accurately and efficiently and could lead to business disruption.•In addition, we have outsourced certain support functions to third-party service providers to achieve cost savings and efficiencies. If the service providers to which we have outsourced these functions to do not perform effectively, we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and, depending on the function involved, we may experience business disruption, processing inefficiencies, or harm employee morale.11Table of ContentsItem 1b
