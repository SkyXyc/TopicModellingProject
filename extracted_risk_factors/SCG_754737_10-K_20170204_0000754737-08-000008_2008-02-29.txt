sells and transports natural gas to 302,500 customers (each as of December 31,
2007). SCE&G's business experiences seasonal fluctuations, with generally
higher sales of electricity during the summer and winter months because of air
conditioning and heating requirements, and generally higher sales of natural gas
during the winter months due to heating requirements. SCE&G's electric
service territory extends into 24 counties covering nearly 16,000 square miles
in the central, southern and southwestern portions of South Carolina. The
service area for natural gas encompasses all or part of 35 counties in South

    COMPETITION
     
    For a
discussion of the impact of competition, see the Overview section of
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations for SCANA and SCE&G.
     
    CAPITAL
REQUIREMENTS
     
    SCANA’s
regulated subsidiaries, including SCE&G, require cash to fund operations,
construction programs and dividend payments to SCANA. To replace existing plant
investment and to expand to meet future demand for electricity and gas, SCANA’s
regulated subsidiaries must attract the necessary financial capital on
reasonable terms. Regulated subsidiaries recover the costs of providing services
through rates charged to customers. Rates for regulated services are generally
based on historical costs. As customer growth and inflation occur and these
subsidiaries continue their construction programs, rate increases will be
sought. The future financial position and results of operations of the regulated
subsidiaries will be affected by their ability to obtain adequate and timely
rate and other regulatory relief, when requested.
     
    For a
discussion of various rate matters and their impact on capital requirements, see
the Regulatory Matters section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations for SCANA and SCE&G and
Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for SCANA and
SCE&G.
     
    During
the three-year period 2008-2010, SCANA and SCE&G expect to meet capital
requirements through internally generated funds, issuance of equity and
short-term and long-term borrowings. SCANA and SCE&G expect that they have
or can obtain adequate sources of financing to meet their projected cash
requirements for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable
future.

discussion of cash requirements for construction and nuclear fuel expenditures,

    SCANA's
ratios of earnings to fixed charges were 3.03, 2.94, 2.19, 2.65 and 2.82 for the
years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
 SCE&G’s ratios of earnings to fixed charges were 3.40, 3.32, 2.26,
3.40 and 3.25 for the same periods.  SCE&G’s ratios of earnings to
combined fixed charges and preference dividends were 3.17, 3.08, 2.10, 3.15 and
3.01 for the same periods.  SCANA’s and SCE&G’s ratios for 2005
were negatively impacted by the large amounts of accelerated depreciation
discussed at Results of Operations - Income Taxes - Recognition
of Synthetic Fuel Tax Credits in their respective Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations sections, and
because the calculation necessarily excludes the related and fully offsetting
tax benefits recorded in that year.

    Sales for
resale include sales to seven municipalities. Sales under the NMST during 2007
include sales to 20 investor-owned utilities or registered marketers, four
electric cooperatives and four federal/state electric agencies. During 2006
sales under the NMST included sales to 25 investor-owned utilities or registered
marketers, three electric cooperatives, and three federal/state electric
agencies.
     
    During
2007 SCE&G recorded a net increase of 15,900 electric customers (growth
rate of 2.6%), increasing its total electric customers to 639,300 at year end.
During 2007, a new all-time peak demand of 4,926 megawatts (MW) was set on
August 10, 2007.
     
    For the
three-year period 2008-2010, SCE&G projects total territorial kilowatt hour
(KWh) sales of electricity to decrease 0.4% annually (assuming normal weather),
total electric customer base to increase 2.4% annually and territorial peak load
(summer, in MW) to decrease 0.1% annually.  The projected decrease in
KWh sales and territorial peak load result from the scheduled expiration of
certain sales for resale contracts.  While SCE&G's goal is to
maintain a reserve margin of between 12% and 18%, weather and other factors
affect territorial peak load and can cause actual generating capacity on any
given day to fall significantly below the reserve margin goal.
     
    Electric
Interconnections
     
    SCE&G
purchases all of the electric generation of GENCO's Williams Station under a
Unit Power Sales Agreement which has been approved by FERC. Williams Station has
a net generating capacity (summer rating) of 615 MW.
     
    SCE&G's
transmission system forms part of an interconnected grid extending over a large
part of the southern and eastern portions of the nation. SCE&G, Dominion
Virginia Power, Duke Power Carolinas, Progress Energy Carolinas, APGI (Yadkin
Division) and the South Carolina Public Service Authority (Santee Cooper) are
members of the Virginia-Carolinas Reliability Group, one of several geographic
divisions within the Southeastern Electric Reliability Council (SERC). SERC is a
regional entity of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC)
responsible for promoting, coordinating and ensuring the reliability and
adequacy of the bulk power supply systems in the geographic area served by the
member systems. SCE&G also interconnects with Georgia Power Company,
Oglethorpe Power Corporation and the Southeastern Power Administration's Clarks
Hill Project. For a discussion of the impact certain legislative and regulatory
initiatives may have on SCE&G's transmission system, see Electric Operations
within the Overview section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations for SCANA and SCE&G.

    Six of
the fossil fuel-fired plants use coal. Unit trains and in some cases trucks and
barges deliver coal to these plants. On December 31, 2007 SCE&G had
approximately a 71-day supply of coal in inventory.
     
    Coal is
obtained through long-term supply contracts and spot market purchases. Long-term
contracts exist with six suppliers located in eastern Kentucky, Tennessee and
West Virginia. These contracts provide for approximately 4.1 million tons
annually, which is 65% of total expected coal purchases for 2008. Sulfur
restrictions on the contract coal range from 1.0% to 1.5%. These contracts
expire at various times through 2010. Spot market purchases are expected to
continue when needed or when prices are favorable.
     
    SCANA and
SCE&G believe that SCE&G's operations comply with all existing
regulations relating to the discharge of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. See
additional discussion at Environmental Matters in Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for SCANA and
SCE&G.
     
    SCE&G
has adequate supplies of uranium or enriched uranium product under contract to
manufacture nuclear fuel for the V. C. Summer Nuclear Station (Summer Station)
through 2009. The following table summarizes contract commitments for the stages

can store spent nuclear fuel on-site until at least 2018 and expects to expand
its storage capacity to accommodate the spent fuel output for the life of Summer
Station through dry cask storage or other technology as it becomes available. In
addition, Summer Station has sufficient on-site storage capacity to permit
storage of the entire reactor core in the event that complete unloading should
become desirable or necessary. For information about the contract with the

    For the
three-year period 2008-2010, SCANA projects total consolidated sales of
regulated natural gas in dekatherms (DT) to increase 1.7% annually (assuming
normal weather). Annual projected increases over such period in DT sales include
residential of 2.6%, commercial of 1.5% and industrial 1.1%.
     
    SCANA's
total consolidated regulated natural gas customer base is projected to increase
3.3% annually. During 2007 SCANA recorded a net increase of 21,000 regulated gas
customers (growth rate of 2.8%), increasing its regulated gas customers to
759,000.  Of this increase, SCE&G recorded a net increase of 5,300 gas
customers (growth rate of 1.8%), increasing its total gas customers to 302,500
(as of December 31, 2007).
     
    Demand
for gas changes primarily due to the effect of weather and the price
relationship between gas and alternate fuels.

    SCE&G
purchases natural gas under contracts with producers and marketers in both the
spot and long-term markets. The gas is brought to South Carolina through
transportation agreements with Southern Natural (expiring in 2010), Transco
(expiring in 2008 and 2017) and CGTC (expiring 2009). The daily volume of gas
that SCE&G is entitled to transport under these contracts on a firm basis is
161,143 DT from Southern Natural, 64,652 DT from Transco and 296,629 DT from
CGTC. Natural gas volumes may be brought to SCE&G's system as capacity is
available for interruptible transportation. In addition, SCE&G, under
contract with SEMI, is entitled to receive a daily contract demand of 120,000
DTs for use in either electric generation or for resale to SCE&G’s
customers.
     
    The daily
volume of gas that SEMI is entitled to transport under its service agreement
with CGTC (expiring in 2023) on a firm basis is 198,083 DT.
     
    SCE&G
purchased natural gas at an average cost of $9.69 per MCF during 2007 and $9.82
per MCF during 2006.
     
    SCE&G
was allocated 5,406 MMCF of natural gas storage space on Southern Natural and
Transco. Approximately 4,224 MMCF of gas were in storage on December 31,
2007. To meet the requirements of its high priority natural gas customers during
periods of maximum demand, SCE&G supplements its supplies of natural gas
with two LNG liquefaction and storage facilities. The LNG plants are capable of
storing the liquefied equivalent of 1,880 MMCF of natural gas. Approximately
1,758 MMCF (liquefied equivalent) of gas were in storage at December 31,
2007.

short-term basis at current price indices and on a long-term basis for
reliability assurance at index prices plus a reservation charge. Transco and
Dominion Transmission, Inc. (Dominion) deliver the gas to North Carolina through
transportation agreements with expiration dates ranging through 2016. On a peak
day, PSNC Energy may transport daily volumes of gas under these contracts on a
firm basis of 259,894 DT from Transco and 7,331 DT from Dominion.

    To meet
the requirements of its high priority natural gas customers during periods of
maximum demand, PSNC Energy supplements its supplies of natural gas with
underground natural gas storage services and LNG peaking services. Underground
natural gas storage service agreements with Dominion, Columbia Gas Transmission,
Transco and Spectra Energy provide for storage capacity of approximately 12,800
MMCF. Approximately 11,000 MMCF of gas were in storage at December 31,
2007. In addition, PSNC Energy's own LNG facility can store the liquefied
equivalent of 1,000 MMCF of natural gas with regasification capability of
approximately 100 MMCF per day. Approximately 800 MMCF (liquefied equivalent) of
gas were in storage at December 31, 2007. LNG storage service agreements
with Transco, Cove Point LNG and Pine Needle LNG provide for 1,300
MMCF (liquefied equivalent) of storage space. Approximately 1,100 MMCF
(liquefied equivalent) were in storage at December 31, 2007.
     
    SCANA and
SCE&G believe that supplies under long-term contracts and supplies available
for spot market purchase are adequate to meet existing customer demands and to
accommodate growth.

primarily in the Southeast. In addition, SCANA Energy, a division of SEMI,
markets natural gas to over 475,000 customers (as of December 31, 2007) in
Georgia's natural gas market. SCANA Energy's total customer base represents over
a 30% share of the approximately 1.5 million customers in Georgia's
deregulated natural gas market. SCANA Energy remains the second largest natural
gas marketer in the state.
     
    Risk
Management
     
    SCANA and
SCE&G have established policies and procedures and risk limits to control
the level of market, credit, liquidity and operational and administrative risks
assumed by them. The Board of Directors of each company has delegated to a Risk
Management Committee the authority to set risk limits, establish policies and
procedures for risk management and measurement, and to oversee and review the
risk management process and infrastructure. The Risk Management Committee, which
is comprised of certain officers, including a Risk Management Officer and senior
officers, apprises the Board of Directors of each company with regard to the
management of risk and brings to the Board's attention any areas of concern.
Written policies define the physical and financial transactions that are
approved, as well as the authorization requirements and limits for
transactions.

pay the previous licensee an amount equal to its net investment in the project,
not to exceed fair value, plus severance damages.
     
    For a
discussion of legislative and regulatory initiatives being implemented that will
affect SCE&G's transmission system, see Electric Operations within the
Overview section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations for SCANA and SCE&G.
     
    SCE&G
is subject to regulation by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC) with respect to the ownership, operation and decommissioning of Summer
Station. The NRC's jurisdiction encompasses broad supervisory and regulatory
powers over the construction and operation of nuclear reactors, including
matters of health and safety, antitrust considerations and environmental impact.
In addition, the Federal Emergency Management Agency reviews, in conjunction
with the NRC, certain aspects of emergency planning relating to the operation of
nuclear plants.
     
    RATE
MATTERS
     
    For a
discussion of the impact of various rate matters, see the Regulatory Matters
section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations for SCANA and SCE&G, and Note 2 to the
consolidated financial statements for SCANA and SCE&G.
     
    SCE&G's
and PSNC Energy's gas rate schedules for their residential and small commercial
and small industrial customers include a weather normalization adjustment (WNA).
SCE&G's and PSNC Energy's WNA were approved by the SCPSC and NCUC,
respectively, and are in effect for bills rendered during the period
November 1 through April 30 of each year. In each case the WNA
increases tariff rates if weather is warmer than normal and decreases rates if
weather is colder than normal. The WNA does not change the seasonality of gas
revenues, but reduces fluctuations in revenues and earnings caused by abnormal
weather.
     
    Fuel Cost
Recovery Procedures
     
    The
SCPSC’s fuel cost recovery procedure determines the fuel component in
SCE&G's retail electric base rates annually based on projected fuel costs
for the ensuing 12-month period, adjusted for any overcollection or
undercollection from the preceding 12-month period. SCE&G may request a
formal proceeding at any time should circumstances dictate such a
review.  As part of the annual review of fuel costs, the SCPSC
approved SCE&G’s request to increase the cost of fuel component from 2.516
cents per KWh to 2.630 cents per KWh effective the first billing cycle in May
2007. 
     
    SCE&G's gas rate
schedules and contracts include mechanisms that allow it to recover from its
customers changes in the actual cost of gas. SCE&G's firm gas rates allow
for the recovery of the cost of gas, based on projections, as established by the
SCPSC. SCE&G adjusts its cost of gas on a monthly basis based on a
twelve-month rolling average.
     
    In May 2007, the law was
changed to revise the statutory definition of fuel costs to include certain
variable environmental costs such as ammonia, lime, limestone and catalysts
consumed in reducing or treating emissions.  The revised definition
also includes the cost of emission allowances used for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen
oxide, and mercury and particulates.
     
    In
addition to WNA, PSNC Energy’s Rider D rate mechanism serves to reduce
fluctuations in PSNC Energy’s earnings. The Rider D mechanism allows PSNC Energy
to recover, in any manner authorized by the NCUC, losses on negotiated gas and
transportation sales. The Rider D rate mechanism also allows PSNC Energy to
recover from customers all prudently incurred gas costs and certain
uncollectible expenses related to gas cost.
     
    PSNC
Energy's rates are established using a benchmark cost of gas approved by the
NCUC, which may be modified periodically to reflect changes in the market price
of natural gas. PSNC Energy revises its tariffs with the NCUC as necessary to
track these changes and accounts for any over- or under-collections of the
delivered cost of gas in its deferred accounts for subsequent rate
consideration. The NCUC reviews PSNC Energy's gas purchasing practices
annually.
     
    ENVIRONMENTAL
MATTERS
     
    Federal
and state authorities have imposed environmental regulations and standards
relating primarily to air emissions, wastewater discharges and solid, toxic and
hazardous waste management. Developments in these areas may require that
equipment and facilities be modified, supplemented or replaced. The ultimate
effect of these regulations and standards upon existing and proposed operations
cannot be predicted. For a more complete discussion of how these regulations and
standards impact SCANA and SCE&G, see the Environmental Matters section of
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations for SCANA and SCE&G and the consolidated financial statements for
SCANA and SCE&G (Note 10B).
     
    OTHER
MATTERS
     
    For a
discussion of SCE&G's insurance coverage for Summer Station, see
Note 10A to the consolidated financial statements for SCANA and
SCE&G.
     
    ITEM
1A.  RISK FACTORS
     
    The
risk factors that follow relate in each case to SCANA Corporation and its
subsidiaries (the Company), and where indicated the risk factors also relate to
South Carolina Electric & Gas Company and its consolidated affiliates
(SCE&G).
     
    Commodity
price changes, delays and other factors may affect the operating cost, capital
expenditures and competitive positions of the Company's and SCE&G's energy
businesses, thereby adversely impacting results of operations, cash flows and
financial condition.
    
      
      Our
energy businesses are sensitive to changes in coal, gas, oil and other commodity
prices and availability. Any changes could affect the prices these businesses
charge, their operating costs and the competitive position of their products and
services. SCE&G is able to recover the cost of fuel used in electric
generation through retail customers' bills, but increases in fuel costs affect
electric prices and, therefore, the competitive position of electricity against
other energy sources. In the case of regulated natural gas operations, costs for
purchased gas and pipeline capacity are recovered through retail customers'
bills, but increases in gas costs affect total retail prices and, therefore, the
competitive position of gas relative to electricity and other forms of energy.
Increases in gas costs may also result in lower usage by customers unable to
switch to alternate fuels.
      
      Additionally, the Company and SCE&G
anticipate significant capital expenditures for environmental compliance and
baseload generation in order to meet future usage demands.  The cost
of additional baseload generation may be affected by the choice of technology or
fuel related to such generation, each of which may be driven by environmental
and other non-economic factors.  The completion of these projects
within established budgets and timeframes is contingent upon many variables
including the obtaining of permits and licenses in a timely manner and our
timely securing of labor and materials at estimated costs.  Recently,
certain construction commodities such as steel and concrete have experienced
significant price increases due to worldwide demand.  Also, to operate
our air pollution control equipment, we use significant quantities of ammonia
and lime.  With mandated compliance deadlines for air pollution
controls, demand for these reagents may increase and result in higher purchase
costs.  Also, higher worldwide demand for copper, which we use in our
transmission and distribution lines, has led to significant price
increases.  Our ability to maintain our operations or to complete
construction projects and new baseload generation (whether based on nuclear or
another form of generation) at reasonable cost, if at all, could be adversely
affected by increases in worldwide demand for key parts or commodities,
increases in the price of or the unavailability of labor, commodities or other
materials, increases in lead times for components, increased environmental
pressures, a failure in the supply chain (whether resulting from the foregoing
or other factors) or delays in licensing, siting, design, financing or
construction.  To the extent that delays occur or cost overages are
not recoverable, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition
may be diminished.
       
    
    The
Company and SCE&G do not fully hedge against price changes in commodities.
This could result in increased costs, thereby resulting in lower margins and
adversely affecting results of operations, cash flows and financial
condition.
     
    The
Company and SCE&G attempt to manage commodity price exposure by establishing
risk limits and entering into contracts to offset some of our positions (i.e.,
to hedge our exposure to demand, market effects of weather and other changes in
commodity prices). We do not hedge the entire exposure of our operations from
commodity price volatility. To the extent we do not hedge against commodity
price volatility or our hedges are not effective, results of operations, cash
flows and financial condition may be diminished.
     
    Changing
and complex laws and regulations to which the Company and SCE&G are subject
could adversely affect revenues or increase costs or curtail activities, thereby
adversely impacting results of operations, cash flows and financial
condition.
     
    The
Company and SCE&G must comply with extensive federal, state and local laws
and regulations. Such regulation widely affects the operation of our business.
The effects encompass, among many other aspects of our business, the licensing
and siting of facilities, safety, reliability of our transmission system,
physical and cyber security of key assets, information privacy, the issuance of
securities, financial reporting, interaction among affiliates, and the payment
of dividends. Changes to these regulations are ongoing, and we cannot predict
the future course of changes in this regulatory environment or the ultimate
effect that this changing regulatory environment will have on the Company’s or
SCE&G’s business.
     
    The
Company and SCE&G are subject to extensive rate regulation which could
adversely affect operations. In particular, SCE&G's electric operations in
South Carolina and the Company's gas distribution operations in South Carolina
(comprised of SCE&G) and North Carolina are regulated by state utilities
commissions. The Company’s interstate gas pipeline is subject to federal
oversight.  Our gas marketing operations in Georgia are also subject
to state regulatory oversight. There can be no assurance that Georgia’s gas
delivery regulatory framework will remain unchanged as dynamic market conditions
evolve. Although we believe we have constructive relationships with our
regulators, our ability to obtain rate increases that will allow us to maintain
reasonable rates of return is dependent upon regulatory discretion, and there
can be no assurance that we will be able to implement rate increases when
sought.
     
    The
Company and SCE&G are subject to extensive federal, state and local
environmental laws and regulations including air emissions (such as reducing
nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions, or potential future
control of greenhouse gas emissions).  Compliance with these laws and
regulations requires us to commit significant capital toward environmental
monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment, emission fees and
permits at our facilities. These expenditures have been significant in the past
and are expected to increase in the future. Changes in compliance requirements
or a more burdensome interpretation by governmental authorities of existing
requirements may impose additional costs on us or require us to curtail some of
our activities. Costs of compliance with environmental regulations could harm
our industry, our business and our results of operations and financial position,
especially if emission or discharge limits are reduced, more extensive
permitting requirements are imposed or additional regulatory requirements are
imposed.
     
    The
Company and SCE&G are vulnerable to interest rate increases which would
increase our borrowing costs, and may not have access to capital at favorable
rates, if at all, both of which may adversely affect results of operations, cash
flows and financial condition.
     
    Changes
in interest rates can affect the cost of borrowing on variable rate debt
outstanding, on refinancing of debt maturities and on incremental borrowing to
fund new investments. The Company's and SCE&G’s business plans reflect the
expectation that we will have access to the capital markets on satisfactory
terms to fund commitments. Moreover, the ability to maintain short-term
liquidity by utilizing commercial paper programs is dependent upon maintaining
investment grade debt ratings. The liquidity of the Company and SCE&G would
be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in the commercial paper market or
if bank credit facilities became unavailable at acceptable rates.
     
    SCANA
may not be able to maintain its leverage ratio at a level considered appropriate
by debt rating agencies. This could result in downgrades of SCANA's debt
ratings, thereby increasing its borrowing costs and adversely affecting its
results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
     
    SCANA's
leverage ratio of debt to capital increased significantly following its
acquisition in 2000 of PSNC Energy, and was approximately 55% at
December 31, 2007. SCANA has publicly announced its desire to maintain this
leverage ratio at 54% to 55%, but SCANA's ability to do so depends on a number
of factors. If SCANA is not able to maintain its leverage ratio, SCANA's debt
ratings may be affected, it may be required to pay higher interest rates on its
long- and short-term indebtedness, and its access to the capital markets may be
limited.
     
    A
downgrade in the credit rating of SCANA or any of SCANA’s subsidiaries,
including SCE&G, could negatively affect their ability to access capital and
to operate their businesses, thereby adversely affecting results of operations,
cash flows and financial condition.
     
    Standard &
Poor's Ratings Services (S&P), Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) and Fitch
Ratings (Fitch) rate SCANA's long-term senior unsecured debt at BBB+, Baa1 and
A-, respectively.  S&P, Moody's and Fitch rate SCE&G's long-term
senior secured debt at A-, A2 and A+, respectively.  S&P, Moody’s and
Fitch rate PSNC Energy's long-term senior unsecured debt at A-, A3 and A,
respectively.  Moody’s and Fitch carry a stable outlook on each of
their ratings.  S&P carries a negative outlook on each of its
ratings.  If S&P, Moody's or Fitch were to downgrade any of these
long-term ratings, particularly to below investment grade, borrowing costs would
increase, which would diminish financial results, and the potential pool of
investors and funding sources could decrease. S&P, Moody's and Fitch rate
the short-term debt of SCE&G and PSNC Energy at A-2, P-2 and F-1,
respectively. If these short-term ratings were to decline, it could
significantly limit access to the commercial paper market and other sources of
liquidity.
     
    Operating
results may be adversely affected by abnormal weather.
     
    The
Company and SCE&G have historically sold less power, delivered less gas and
received lower prices for natural gas in deregulated markets, and consequently
earned less income, when weather conditions have been milder than normal. Mild
weather in the future could diminish the revenues and results of operations and
harm the financial condition of the Company and SCE&G. In addition, severe
weather can be destructive, causing outages and property damage, adversely
affecting operating expenses and revenues.
     
    
      
        
        
      
      
         

        
        
      
      
        Table of Contents
      
    
    Potential
competitive changes may adversely affect our gas and electricity businesses due
to the loss of customers, reductions in revenues, or write-down of stranded
assets.
     
    The
utility industry has been undergoing dramatic structural change for several
years, resulting in increasing competitive pressures on electric and natural gas
utility companies. Competition in wholesale power sales has been introduced on a
national level. Some states have also mandated or encouraged competition at the
retail level. Increased competition may create greater risks to the stability of
utility earnings generally and may in the future reduce earnings from retail
electric and natural gas sales. In a deregulated environment, formerly regulated
utility companies that are not responsive to a competitive energy marketplace
may suffer erosion in market share, revenues and profits as competitors gain
access to their customers. In addition, SCANA's and SCE&G's generation
assets would be exposed to considerable financial risk in a deregulated electric
market. If market prices for electric generation do not produce adequate revenue
streams and the enabling legislation or regulatory actions do not provide for
recovery of the resulting stranded costs, a write-down in the value of the
related assets would be required.
     
    The
Company and SCE&G are subject to risks associated with changes in business
climate which could increase and adversely affect revenues, results of
operations, cash flows and financial condition and could limit access to
capital.
     
    Sales and
sales growth is dependent upon the economic climate in the service territories
of the Company and SCE&G, which may be affected by regional, national or
even international economic factors. Some economic sectors important to our
customer base may be particularly affected. Adverse events, economic or
otherwise, may also affect the operations of key customers.  Such
events may result in the failure of customers to make timely payments to us. The
success of local and state governments in attracting new industry to our service
territories is important to our sales and growth in sales.
     
    Factors
that generally could affect our ability to access capital include economic
conditions and our capital structure. Much of our business is capital intensive,
and achievement of our long-term growth targets is dependent, at least in part,
upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be
attractive. If our ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained,
our interest costs will likely increase and our financial condition and future
results of operations could be significantly harmed.
     
    Problems
with operations could cause us to curtail or limit our ability to serve
customers or cause us to incur substantial costs, thereby adversely impacting
revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial
condition.
     
    Critical
processes or systems in the Company’s or SCE&G’s operations could become
impaired or fail from a variety of causes, such as equipment breakdown,
transmission line failure, information systems failure or security breach, the
effects of drought (including reduced water levels) on the operation of emission
control or other generation equipment, and the effects of a pandemic or
terrorist attack on our workforce or on the ability of vendors and suppliers to
maintain services key to our operations.  
     
    In
particular, as the operator of power generation facilities, SCE&G could
incur problems such as the breakdown or failure of power generation or emission
control equipment, transmission lines, other equipment or processes which would
result in performance below assumed levels of output or efficiency. In addition,
any such breakdown or failure may result in SCE&G purchasing replacement
power at market rates, if such replacement power is available at all. If
replacement power is not available, such problems could result in interruptions
of service (blackout or brownout conditions) in all or part of SCE&G’s
territory or elsewhere in the region. These purchases are subject to state
regulatory prudency reviews for recovery through rates.
     
    Covenants
in certain financial instruments may limit SCANA's ability to pay dividends,
thereby adversely impacting the valuation of our common stock and our access to
capital.
     
    Our
assets consist primarily of investments in subsidiaries. Dividends on our common
stock depend on the earnings, financial condition and capital requirements of
our subsidiaries, principally SCE&G, PSNC Energy and SEMI. Our ability to
pay dividends on our common stock may also be limited by existing or future
covenants limiting the right of our subsidiaries to pay dividends on their
common stock. Any significant reduction in our payment of dividends in the
future may result in a decline in the value of our common stock. Such a decline
in value could limit our ability to raise debt and equity capital.
     
    A
significant portion of SCE&G's generating capacity is derived from nuclear
power, the use of which exposes us to regulatory, environmental and business
risks. These risks could increase our costs or otherwise constrain our business,
thereby adversely impacting our results of operations, cash flows and financial
condition.
     
    The V.C.
Summer nuclear plant, operated by SCE&G, provided approximately
5.7 million MWh, or 21% of our generation capacity, in 2007.  As such,
SCE&G is subject to various risks of nuclear generation, which include the
following:
     
    The
potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from a
release of radioactive materials in connection with the operation of nuclear
facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive
materials;
     
    
      
        
        
      
      
         

        
        
      
      
        Table of Contents
      
    
    Limitations
on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses
that might arise in connection with our nuclear operations or those of others in
the United States;
     
    Uncertainties
with respect to procurement of enriched uranium fuel;
     
    Uncertainties
with respect to contingencies if insurance coverage is inadequate;
and
     
    Uncertainties
with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning
nuclear plants at the end of their operating lives.
     
    The NRC
has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related
requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. In the event of
non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit,
or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until
compliance is achieved. Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could
necessitate capital expenditures at nuclear plants such as ours. In addition,
although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident, if a major
incident should occur at a domestic nuclear facility, it could harm our results
of operations, cash flows and financial condition. A major incident at a nuclear
facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the
operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit. Finally, in today's
environment, there is a heightened risk of terrorist attack on the nation's
nuclear facilities, which has resulted in increased security costs at our
nuclear plant.
     
    Failure
to retain and attract key personnel could adversely affect the Company’s and
SCE&G’s operations and financial performance.
     
    Implementation
of our strategic plan and growth strategy requires that we attract, retain and
develop executive officers and other professional and technical employees with
the skills and experience necessary to successfully manage our operations and
grow our business. Competition for these employees is high, and in some cases we
must compete for these employees on a regional or national basis. We may be
unable to attract and retain these personnel. Further, the Company’s or
SCE&G’s ability to construct or maintain generation or other assets requires
the availability of suitable skilled contractor personnel. We may be unable to
obtain appropriate contractor personnel at the times and places
needed.
     
    The
Company and SCE&G are subject to the risk that strategic decisions made by
us either do not result in a return of or on invested capital or might
negatively impact our competitive position, which can adversely impact our
results of operations, cash flows, financial position, and access to
capital.
     
    From time
to time, the Company and SCE&G make strategic decisions that may impact our
direction with regard to business opportunities, the services and technologies
offered to customers or that are used to serve customers, and the generating
plant and other infrastructure that form the basis of much of our business.
These strategic decisions may not result in a return of or on our invested
capital, and the effects of these strategic decisions may have long-term
implications that are not likely to be known to us in the short-term. Changing
political climates and public attitudes may adversely affect the ongoing
acceptability of strategic decisions that have been made, to the detriment of
the Company or SCE&G.  Over time, these strategic decisions or
changing attitudes toward such decisions, which could be adverse to the
Company’s or SCE&G’s interests, may have a negative effect on our results of
operations, cash flows and financial position, as well as limit our ability to
access capital.
     
    The
Company and SCE&G are subject to the reputational risks that may result from
a failure of their adherence to high standards of compliance with laws and
regulations, ethical conduct, operational effectiveness, and safety of
employees, customers and the public.  These risks could adversely affect
the valuation of our common stock and the Company’s and SCE&G’s access to
capital.
     
    The
Company and SCE&G are committed to comply with all laws and regulations, to
focus on the safety of employees, customers and the public and to maintain the
privacy of information related to our customers and employees.  The Company
and SCE&G also are committed to operational excellence and, through their
Code of Conduct and Ethics, to maintain high standards of ethical conduct in
their business operations.  A failure to meet these commitments may subject
the Company and SCE&G, not only to litigation, but also to reputational risk
that could adversely affect the valuation of SCANA’s stock, adversely affect the
Company’s and SCE&G’s access to capital, and result in further regulatory
oversight.
