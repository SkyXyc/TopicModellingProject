Beef Processing

 

Business Description

 

    The Company acquired 78.9% of National Beef for aggregate net cash consideration of $867,869,000 on December 30, 2011.  National Beef, headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri, is one of the largest beef processing companies in the U.S., accounting for approximately 14% of the federally inspected steer and heifer slaughter during 2011, as reported by the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”).   National Beef processes, packages and delivers fresh and frozen beef and beef by-products for sale to customers in the U.S. and international markets.  National Beef’s products include boxed beef, ground beef, hides, tallow, and other beef and beef by-products.

 

Beef production, from the birth of the animal through the delivery of beef products to the customer, is comprised of two primary segments, production and processing.  The production segment raises cattle for slaughter and the processing segment slaughters cattle and packages beef for delivery to customers.  The production segment bears the cost of feeding the cattle to the appropriate market weights and has direct financial exposure to the volatility in grain and other input costs.  Beef processors like National Beef are primarily “spread” operators, earning margin between the selling price for their products and the cost of procuring and processing the cattle.

 




  



7







  




 

    Approximately 90% of National Beef’s revenues are generated from the sale of fresh meat either as a boxed beef product or a case-ready product.  In addition, National Beef sells beef by-products to the variety meat, feed processing, fertilizer and pet food industries.  National Beef also owns 75% of Kansas City Steak Company, LLC (“Kansas City Steak”), which sells portioned beef and other products to customers in the food service and retail channels as well as direct to consumers through the internet and direct mail.

 

    National Beef operates a wet blue tanning facility that sells processed hides to tanners that produce finished leather for the automotive, luxury goods, apparel and furniture industries.  Wet blue tanning refers to the first step in processing raw and brine-cured hides into tanned leather.  National Beef also owns a refrigerated and livestock transportation company that provides transportation services for National Beef and third parties.

 

    The seasonal demand for beef products is generally highest in the spring and summer months.

 

Sales and Marketing

 

    The sales office for National Beef’s domestic operations is responsible for selling and coordinating the movement of approximately 50 million pounds per week of boxed beef products to customers.  National Beef markets its products to national and regional retailers, including supermarket chains, independent grocers, club stores, wholesalers and distributors, food service providers and distributors, further processors and the United States military.  National Beef exports products to more than 30 countries; export sales currently represent approximately 12% of annual revenues.  In 2011, Wal-Mart and its affiliate, Sam’s Club, represented approximately 9% of National Beef’s revenues, and its top 10 customers accounted for approximately 30% of revenues.  Wal-Mart purchases a substantial portion of National Beef’s case-ready products.

 

National Beef emphasizes the sale of higher-margin, value-added products, which include branded boxed beef, case-ready beef, portion control beef and further processed hides.  National Beef believes its value-added products can command higher prices than commodity products because of National Beef’s ability to consistently meet product specifications, based on quality, trim, weight, size, breed or other factors, tailored to the needs of its customers.  In addition to the value-added brands that National Beef owns, National Beef licenses the use of Certified Angus Beef®, a registered trademark of Certified Angus Beef LLC, and Certified Hereford Beef®, a registered trademark of Certified Hereford Beef LLC.




Raw Materials and Procurement

 

The primary raw material for the processing plants is live cattle. The domestic beef industry is characterized by cattle prices that change daily based on seasonal consumption patterns, overall supply and demand for beef and other proteins, cattle inventory levels, weather and other factors.




National Beef has entered into a cattle supply agreement with U.S. Premium Beef, LLC (“USPB”), the current owner of a 15% interest in National Beef that sold a substantial portion of its ownership interest to the Company.  National Beef has agreed to purchase through USPB from the members of USPB 735,385 head of cattle per year (subject to adjustment), based on pricing grids furnished by National Beef to the members of USPB.  National Beef believes the pricing grids are based on terms that could be obtained from an unaffiliated party.  The cattle supply agreement is for an initial five year term, with automatic one year extensions on each annual anniversary date of the Company’s acquisition of National Beef, unless either party provides a notice not to extend sixty days prior to the annual anniversary date.  During its most recent fiscal year, National Beef purchased approximately 20% of the total cattle it processed from USPB members pursuant to a previous cattle supply agreement.  National Beef also purchased additional cattle from certain USPB members outside of the cattle supply agreement.

 




  



8







  







Cattle are also purchased through cash bids and other arrangements from cattle producers in primary and secondary markets.  National Beef purchases cattle from nearly 1,000 suppliers annually.




Processing Facilities




National Beef owns three beef processing facilities located in Liberal, Kansas, Dodge City, Kansas, and Brawley, California.  The Liberal and Dodge City facilities can each process approximately 6,000 cattle per day, and the Brawley facility approximately 2,000 cattle per day.  National Beef owns case-ready facilities in Hummels Wharf, Pennsylvania (approximately 79,000 square feet) and Moultrie, Georgia (approximately 114,000 square feet), and the wet blue tanning facility in St. Joseph, Missouri (approximately 221,000 square feet).  The Kansas City Steak processing facility is located in Kansas City, Kansas (approximately 63,000 square feet).

 

Competition

 

The beef processing industry is highly competitive.  Competition exists both in the purchase of live cattle, as well as in the sale of beef products.  Beef products compete with other protein sources, including pork and poultry, but National Beef’s principal competition comes from other beef processors.  National Beef believes the principal competitive factors in the beef processing industry are price, quality, food safety, customer service, product distribution, technological innovations (such as food safety interventions and packaging technologies) and brand loyalty.  Some of National Beef’s competitors have substantially larger beef operations, greater financial and other resources and wider brand recognition for their products.

 

Regulation and Environmental

 

National Beef’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by the USDA including its Food Safety and Inspection Service (“FSIS”) and its Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (“GIPSA”), the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and other state, local and foreign authorities regarding the processing, packaging, storage, safety, distribution, advertising and labeling of its products.

 

National Beef’s domestic operations are subject to the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921 (“PSA”).  Among other things, this statute generally requires National Beef to make full payment for livestock purchases not later than the close of business the day after the purchase and transfer of possession or determination of the purchase price.  Under the PSA, National Beef must hold in trust for the benefit of unpaid livestock suppliers all livestock purchased until the sellers have received full payment.  At December 31, 2011, National Beef has obtained from an insurance company a surety bond in the amount of $40,900,000 to satisfy these requirements.

 

    The Dodge City and Liberal facilities are subject to Title V permitting pursuant to the federal Clean Air Act and the Kansas Air Quality Act.  The Liberal permit expired on January 25, 2010, but has been administratively extended pending renewal by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.  The Brawley and St. Joseph facilities are subject to secondary air permits which are in place.  The Dodge City, Liberal, Hummels Wharf, Moultrie and Brawley facilities are subject to Clean Air Act Risk Management Plan requirements relating to the use of ammonia as a refrigerant.

 

All of National Beef’s plants are indirect dischargers of wastewater to publicly owned treatment works and are subject to requirements under the federal Clean Water Act, state and municipal laws, as well as agreements or permits with municipal or county authorities.  Upon renewal of these agreements and permits, National Beef is from time to time required to make capital expenditures to upgrade or expand wastewater treatment facilities to address new and more stringent discharge requirements imposed at the time of renewal.  Storm water discharges from National Beef’s plants are also regulated by state and local authorities.




  



9







  




 

All of National Beef’s facilities generate solid wastestreams including small quantities of hazardous wastes.  National Beef is subject to laws that provide for strict, and in certain circumstances joint and several, liability for remediation of hazardous substances at contaminated sites; however, National Beef has not received any demands that it has any liability at sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“Superfund”) or state counterparts.  All plants are subject to community right to know reporting requirements under the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, which requires yearly filings as to the substances used on facility premises.

 

Employees

 

National Beef has approximately 9,400 employees, of which approximately 4,000 are currently represented by collective bargaining agreements.  Approximately 2,800 employees at the Liberal plant are represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union under a collective bargaining agreement scheduled to expire in December 2012.  Approximately 1,100 employees at the Brawley plant are jointly represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union and the Teamsters International Union under a collective bargaining agreement scheduled to expire in December 2013.  Approximately 100 employees at the St. Joseph plant are represented by the United Cereal Workers of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union under a collective bargaining agreement scheduled to expire in May 2014. 




The employees at the Dodge City plant voted in favor of union representation by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union in November 2011.  The union has been certified as the representative of a bargaining unit of approximately 2,600 employees in production and maintenance, shipping and receiving, grounds keeping and the warehouse.




Manufacturing

Idaho Timber




Business Description




Idaho Timber, which was acquired in May 2005, is headquartered in Boise, Idaho and is engaged in the manufacture and/or distribution of various wood products.  Idaho Timber’s principal product lines include remanufacturing dimension lumber; remanufacturing, bundling and bar coding of home center boards for large retailers; and production of 5/4” radius-edge, pine decking.  The net book value of the Company’s investment in Idaho Timber was $64,725,000 at December 31, 2011.




Remanufactured dimension lumber is Idaho Timber’s largest product line.  Dimension lumber is used for general construction and home improvement, remodeling and repair projects, the demand for which is normally a function of housing starts and home size.  All dimension lumber is assigned a quality grade, based on the imperfections in the wood, and higher-grade lumber is sold at a higher price than lower-grade lumber.  Idaho Timber purchases low-grade dimension lumber from sawmills located in North America and Europe and upgrades it into higher-grade dimension lumber products.  The remanufacturing process includes ripping, trimming and planing lumber to reduce imperfections and produce a variety of lumber sizes.  These products are produced at plants located in Florida, North Carolina, Texas, Idaho and New Mexico.




Home center board products are principally sold to large home improvement retailers.  Idaho Timber purchases high-grade boards from sawmills, performs minor re-work on those boards to upgrade the quality, and then packages and bar codes those boards according to customer specifications.  Idaho Timber also operates a sawmill in Arkansas to produce its 5/4” radius-edge, pine decking products.




  



10







  







Idaho Timber owns and operates seven plants, one sawmill that principally produces decking products and one sawmill that produces split-rail fencing.  These nine facilities in the aggregate have approximately 748,000 square feet of manufacturing and office space, covering approximately 154 acres.  One plant is principally dedicated to home center board products and the remaining plants principally produce remanufactured dimension lumber products.




Sales and Marketing




Idaho Timber primarily markets to local, regional and national lumber retailers for its dimension lumber products, home improvement centers for its home center board products and decking treaters for its sawmill product, and other resellers of home construction materials.  For dimension lumber products, sales are primarily generated at each of the plants, with a dedicated sales force located in the same geographic region as the customers the plant serves.  Board and decking products are sold and managed centrally.  Sales of home center board products are heavily dependent on national home center chains.  Idaho Timber’s sales are somewhat concentrated in regions where its facilities are located, with the largest being Florida, 15%; North Carolina, 14%; and Texas, 14%.




Competition




Idaho Timber sells commodity products, and operates in an industry that is very competitive and currently suffering from continuing lack of demand due to limited housing starts and remodeling activity.  Idaho Timber competes against domestic and foreign sawmills and intermediate distributors for its dimension lumber and decking products.  In some cases, Idaho Timber competes on a limited basis with the same sawmills that are a source of supply of low-grade dimension lumber.  Idaho Timber also competes for raw material purchases needed for its remanufactured dimension lumber and home center board products.  A recent increase in off-shore demand for low-grade lumber used in its remanufacturing facilities has further constrained available supply.




Government Regulation




Lumber and decking are identified at Idaho Timber facilities with a grade stamp that shows the grade, moisture content, mill number, species and grading agency.  All lumber is graded in compliance with the National Grading Rule for Dimension Lumber, which is published by the U.S. Department of Commerce.  Idaho Timber facilities are subject to regular inspection by agencies approved by the American Lumber Standards Committee.  Idaho Timber believes that its procedure for grading lumber is highly accurate; however, Idaho Timber could be exposed to product liability claims if it can be demonstrated its products are inappropriately rated.




Plastics Manufacturing




Business Description




Through Conwed Plastics, which was acquired in March 1985, the Company manufactures and markets lightweight plastic netting used for a variety of purposes including, among other things, building and construction, erosion control, packaging, agricultural, carpet padding, filtration and consumer products.  These products are primarily used for containment purposes, reinforcement of other products, packaging for produce and meats, various types of filtration and erosion prevention.  The net book value of the Company’s investment in Conwed Plastics was $46,270,000 at December 31, 2011.




  



11







  







Certain products of Conwed Plastics are proprietary, protected by patents and/or trade secrets.  The Company holds patents on certain improvements to the basic manufacturing processes it uses and on applications thereof.  The Company believes that the expiration of these patents, individually or in the aggregate, is unlikely to have a significant effect on its operations.




Sales and Marketing




Products are marketed both domestically and internationally, with approximately 24% of 2011 revenues generated by customers from Europe, Latin America, Japan and Australia.  Products are sold primarily through an employee sales force, located in the U.S. and Europe.  Conwed Plastics emphasizes development of new products and new applications of existing products to grow its revenues.  New product development focuses on market niches where proprietary technology and expertise can lead to sustainable competitive economic advantages.  Approximately half of Conwed Plastics’ revenues are generated on a make to order basis.




Competition




Conwed Plastics is subject to domestic and international competition, generally on the basis of price, service and quality.  Conwed Plastics has 3 to 5 competitors in most of its market segments but the size and type of its competition varies by market segment.  Additionally, certain products are dependent on cyclical industries, including the construction industry.  The cost of the principal raw material used in its products, polypropylene, has increased by approximately 20% over the last three years, a continuing trend that started in 2002.  The price of polypropylene has historically fluctuated with the price of oil and natural gas but growing economies in China and India have resulted in increased demand for raw materials and raised prices globally.

 
 

Oil and Gas Drilling Services




Business Description




Keen is a land based contract oil and gas drilling company based in Stillwater, Oklahoma that provides drilling services to independent oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in the Mid-Continent Region of the U.S.  Keen currently operates drilling rigs in Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana.  Keen became a consolidated subsidiary in November 2009; the net book value of the Company’s investment in Keen was $210,194,000 at December 31, 2011.




Keen, which has been in business since 1991, typically generates revenues through drilling contracts based on daily rates (daywork contracts), footage (charged by depth of the well) or based on a turnkey contract (fixed price to drill a well).  In 2011, all drilling services were performed pursuant to daywork contracts.  Keen supplies the drilling rig, all ancillary equipment and drilling personnel; all of Keen’s rigs are capable of drilling horizontal and directional wells.  Once Keen has drilled a well for a customer, the drilling rig will be moved off of the well and another service provider will use a service rig (a smaller rig) that is built for completions, which brings the well into production.  Keen has 26 drilling rigs in its fleet that have rated maximum depth capabilities ranging from 12,000 feet to 22,000 feet.  Keen also owns and operates a fleet of trucks, trailers and other construction equipment primarily used to take down, rig up and transport rigs between locations and to prepare the locations for drilling operations.

 
 

Keen’s revenue volume and profitability are significantly affected by the actual and anticipated price of natural gas and oil, levels of natural gas and oil in storage and the supply of drilling rigs available in the marketplace.  The exploration and production industry is cyclical and the level of exploration and production activity has historically been very volatile.  During periods of lower levels of drilling activity, price competition for drilling services tends to increase, which may result in reduced revenues and profitability; conversely, during periods of increased drilling activity, drilling rigs are in demand often resulting in higher prices and contractual commitments from customers to obtain exclusive use of a particular rig for a longer term.

Sales and Marketing




Keen markets its drilling rigs to a number of independent oil and gas companies.  Most of Keen’s contracts are with established customers on a competitive bid or negotiated basis and may cover one well, a multi-well project or are entered into for a specified period of time.  At December 31, 2011, Keen has 6 drilling rigs under contract for a remaining term of more than 1 year, 14 rigs are operating under term contracts that will expire within the next 12 months, 2 are under well-to-well contracts with specific customers, and 4 are not currently under contract.




Keen’s business is fairly concentrated with its top eight customers accounting for over 77% of 2011 drilling revenues.  Two customers accounted for 34% of 2011 drilling revenues and six other customers each exceeded 5% of 2011 drilling revenues.




Competition




Customers award contracts to contract drillers based on factors such as price, rig availability, quality of service, proximity to the well site, experience with the specific geological formation, condition and type of equipment, reputation, safety of operations and customer relationships.  Contracts for drilling services may be awarded based solely on price.  Although contract drilling companies generally compete on a regional basis, drilling rigs can be moved from one market to another in response to market conditions which can have the effect of increasing competition.




Gaming Entertainment




Business Description




Premier owns the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Biloxi, located in Biloxi, Mississippi, which opened to the public on June 30, 2007.  Acquired in 2006, the Company owns all of Premier’s common units; including outstanding loans; the net book value of the Company’s investment in Premier was $227,028,000 at December 31, 2011.




The Hard Rock Hotel & Casino is located on a 10 acre site on the Mississippi Gulf Coast and has approximately 1,305 slot machines, 52 table games, six live poker tables, five restaurants (including a Hard Rock Café and Ruth’s Chris Steakhouse), a full service spa, an outdoor pool and deck, retail space, an eleven-story hotel with 325 rooms and suites and a Hard Rock Live! entertainment venue with a capacity of approximately 2,000 persons.  The Company is investigating a hotel expansion which would add 154 rooms at an estimated cost of $30,000,000.  If the Company decides to go forward, construction could begin in the second quarter of 2012.




Premier’s marketing strategy is to position the resort as a full service gaming, boutique hotel and entertainment resort catering to the Mississippi Gulf Coast marketplace and the southern region of the U.S.  The Mississippi Gulf Coast region is located along the Interstate 10 corridor and is within a ninety minute drive from the New Orleans metropolitan area, Mobile, Alabama and the Florida panhandle.  Premier’s primary means of marketing utilizes its database of customers for direct mail campaigns and promotional giveaways designed to reward customers and generate loyalty and repeat visits.  In addition, Premier benefits from the “Hard Rock” brand name which appeals to a broad range of customers.




The Hard Rock Biloxi’s casino is constructed over water on concrete pilings; however, the threat of hurricanes is a risk to the facility.  Premier’s current insurance policy provides up to $242,000,000 in coverage for damage to real and personal property including business interruption coverage.  The coverage is provided by a panel of U.S., Bermuda and London based insurers and is comprised of a $50,000,000 primary layer and three excess layers.  The coverage is syndicated through several insurance carriers, each with an A.M. Best Rating of A- (Excellent) or better.  Although the insurance policy is an all risk policy, any loss resulting from a weather catastrophe occurrence, which is defined to include damage caused by a named storm, is sublimited to $100,000,000 with a deductible of $5,000,000.

Competition




Premier faces significant competition primarily from ten other gaming operations in the Mississippi Gulf Coast gaming market and secondarily from gaming operations in Baton Rouge and New Orleans, Louisiana as well as from a Native American casino in Atmore, Alabama.  Other competition comes from gaming operations in Lake Charles, Bossier City and Shreveport, Louisiana; Tunica and Philadelphia, Mississippi; Tampa and Hollywood, Florida and other states.  Such competition may increase if gaming operations grow in these markets or if legalized gaming expands to nearby states.  Many of Premier’s competitors are larger and have greater marketing and financial resources.




Government Regulation

 

    The gaming industry in Mississippi is highly regulated.  Premier, its ownership and management are subject to findings of suitability reviews by the Mississippi Gaming Commission.  In addition, the laws, rules and regulations of state and local governments in Mississippi require Premier to hold various licenses, registrations and permits and to obtain various approvals for a variety of matters.  In order to continue operating, Premier must remain in compliance with all laws, rules and regulations and pay gaming taxes on its gross gaming revenues.  Failure to maintain such approvals or obtain renewals when due, or failure to comply with new laws or regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations would have an adverse effect on Premier’s business.  Premier believes it is in compliance with all governmental rules and regulations.




Domestic Real Estate




At December 31, 2011, the Company’s net investment in the domestic real estate segment was $245,700,000.  The real estate operations include a mixture of commercial properties, residential land development projects and other unimproved land.  Certain of the Company’s real estate investments and the real estate carrying values as of December 31, 2011 include: a large scale mixed-use development project with various residential, retail and commercial space located in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina ($33,787,000); approximately 73 acres of land used by Garcadia, the automobile dealership joint venture ($55,360,000); approximately 76 acres of land located on the island of Islesboro, Maine (approved for 13 residential waterfront lots) and 45 fully developed residential lots on approximately 120 acres of land located in Rockport, Maine on Penobscot Bay, ($46,146,000 in the aggregate); and a 15 acre, unentitled air rights parcel above the train tracks behind Union Station in Washington, D.C. ($11,543,000).  None of these projects is secured by any indebtedness.




The Company had previously entered into an agreement with the Panama City-Bay County Airport and Industrial District of Panama City, Florida to purchase approximately 708 acres of land which used to be the Panama City-Bay County International Airport.  The Company had placed $56,500,000 into escrow; the purchase price was subsequently adjusted to $51,870,000, the excess funds were returned and the transaction closed in February 2012.  The Company intends to develop the property into a mixed use community with residential, retail, commercial, educational and office sites.  The project is fully entitled and zoned for 3,200 residential units and 700,000 square feet of commercial space and includes a permitted marina with 117 slips. Development of the property is subject to completion of project design and obtaining required development and construction permits, the timing of which is uncertain.   




The Company owns approximately 31.4% of the outstanding common stock of HomeFed.  In addition, as a result of a 1998 distribution to all of the Company’s shareholders, approximately 7.7% and 9.4% of HomeFed is owned by the Company’s Chairman and President, respectively.  HomeFed is currently engaged, directly and through subsidiaries, in the investment in and development of residential real estate projects in California.  The Company accounts for its investment in HomeFed under the equity method of accounting.  At December 31, 2011, its investment had a carrying value of $47,493,000, which is included in investments in associated companies.  HomeFed is a public company traded on the NASD OTC Bulletin Board (Symbol: HOFD).  Detailed financial and other information about HomeFed may be found on its website (www.homefedcorporation.com).

Residential property sales volume, prices and new building starts have declined significantly in many U.S. markets, including markets in which the Company has real estate projects.  The slowdown in residential sales has been exacerbated by the turmoil in the mortgage lending and credit markets, which has resulted in stricter lending standards and reduced liquidity for prospective home buyers.  The Company is not actively soliciting bids for developed and undeveloped lots in Maine, and has deferred its development plans for certain other projects as well.  The Company intends to wait for market conditions to improve before marketing certain of its projects for sale.




The real estate development industry is subject to substantial environmental, building, construction, zoning and real estate regulations that are imposed by various federal, state and local authorities.  In order to develop its properties, the Company must obtain the approval of numerous governmental agencies regarding such matters as permitted land uses, density, the installation of utility services (such as water, sewer, gas, electric, telephone and cable television) and the dedication of acreage for various community purposes.  Furthermore, changes in prevailing local circumstances or applicable laws may require additional approvals or modifications of approvals previously obtained.  Delays in obtaining required approvals and authorizations could adversely affect the profitability of the Company’s projects.




Medical Product Development




Business Description




At December 31, 2011, the Company owned approximately 96% of Sangart, a development stage biopharmaceutical company principally engaged in developing medicines designed to enhance the oxygenation of oxygen deprived tissues through targeted oxygen delivery.  The Company has invested an aggregate of $211,648,000 in Sangart, principally to help fund Sangart’s ongoing product development activities and overhead costs.  Sangart became a consolidated subsidiary in 2005; the net book value of the Company’s investment in Sangart was $16,356,000 at December 31, 2011.




In 2002, Sangart commenced human clinical trials of MP4OX, a solution of cell-free hemoglobin administered intravenously to provide rapid oxygen delivery to ischemic (oxygen deprived) tissues.  The basis for Sangart’s technology is the result of more than 20 years of research in the understanding of how hemoglobin (the oxygen carrier in red blood cells) functions outside of red blood cells in a cell-free environment and how it can be used in conjunction with normal red blood cells to enhance oxygen delivery to organ tissue.  MP4 products are made from purified human hemoglobin that is extracted from fully screened and tested outdated human blood obtained from accredited blood centers, which is then bound to polyethylene glycol molecules using Sangart’s proprietary processes.  Sangart’s manufacturing process is able to generate approximately four units of MP4OX using a single unit of blood.  Sangart owns or exclusively licenses eighteen U.S. patents and has more than thirty applications pending worldwide covering product composition, manufacturing or methods of use.   Patents applicable to the MP4 technology do not begin to expire until 2017.




During 2010, Sangart completed a Phase 2 proof of concept clinical trial of MP4OX in trauma patients in Europe and South Africa.  Study results were considered to be successful and supported the conduct of a larger Phase 2 clinical study in trauma patients, which commenced in the second quarter of 2011.  If this larger Phase 2 study were to be successful, Sangart would have to conduct Phase 3 clinical studies in trauma patients.  Completing these studies will take several years at substantial cost, and until they are successfully completed, if ever, Sangart will not be able to request marketing approval and generate revenues from sales in the trauma market.  Sangart also recently commenced a Phase 1b clinical study involving its MP4CO product to treat sickle cell disease patients.  If this Phase 1b study were to be successful, Sangart would have to conduct Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies in sickle cell disease patients, at substantial cost, prior to requesting marketing approval for the product.




  



15







  







In addition to obtaining requisite regulatory approvals for the manufacture and sale of MP4 products, including approval of a manufacturing facility which has yet to be built, Sangart would have to create sales, marketing and distribution capabilities prior to any commercial launch, either directly or in partnership with a service provider.  In recent years, substantially all of the funding needed for MP4 development has come from the Company, and the Company expects to provide Sangart with sufficient capital to fund its activities during 2012.  Thereafter, significant additional funding will be needed prior to regulatory approval and commercial launch; the source of such funding has not as yet been determined.




Any successful commercialization of MP4 products will depend on an adequate supply of raw materials, principally human red blood cells and polyethylene glycol, at an acceptable quality, quantity and price.  Sangart has contracted for a supply of human red blood cells that is expected to be sufficient to produce MP4 at volumes needed for a commercial launch; however, if the product is successful additional sources of red blood cells will be needed to support sales growth.  Commitments for quantities of polyethylene glycol to support a commercial launch have not yet been secured.




Government Regulation




As a product intended for medical use, clinical trials, marketing approval, manufacturing and distribution of MP4 is highly regulated.  An application for marketing approval may only be made after the safety and effectiveness of the product has been demonstrated, including through human clinical trial data.  In the U.S., the FDA regulates medical products, including the category known as “biologics”, which includes MP4 products.  The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act govern the testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of MP4 products.




In Europe, each country has its own agency that regulates clinical trials.  However, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”), which is administered by the European Medicines Agency, is an EU-wide regulatory body.  Following completion of clinical trials, marketing approval can be granted either by a centralized application through CHMP, or on a decentralized basis by one or more selected countries.




Other Operations




Wineries




The Company’s winery operations are managed under the umbrella name, Crimson Wine Group (“Crimson”).  Crimson is engaged in the production and sale of premium, ultra premium and luxury wines (i.e., wines that retail for $10 to $14, $14 to $25 and over $25 per 750ml bottle, respectively).  Crimson is headquartered in Napa, California and owns four wineries: Pine Ridge Vineyards, Archery Summit, Chamisal Vineyards and Seghesio Family Vineyards.  Pine Ridge was acquired in 1991 and has been conducting operations since 1978, the Company started Archery Summit in 1993, Chamisal Vineyards was acquired during 2008 and has been conducting operations since 1973, and Seghesio Family Vineyards was acquired in 2011 and has been conducting operations since 1895.  Crimson controls approximately 188 acres of vineyards in the Napa Valley, California, 120 acres of vineyards in the Willamette Valley, Oregon, 97 acres of vineyards in the Edna Valley, California, 231 acres in the Alexander Valley, California and 68 acres in the Russian River Valley, California, substantially all of which are owned and producing grapes.  Additionally, in 2005 and 2006, the Company acquired an aggregate of 611 acres of land in the Horse Heaven Hills of Washington’s Columbia Valley, of which approximately 87 acres have been developed into producing vineyards.  At December 31, 2011, the net book value of the Company’s aggregate investment in Crimson was $177,096,000.




  



16







  







During 2011, Crimson sold approximately 212,000 9-liter equivalent cases of wine generating revenues of $36,864,000.  Crimson’s wines are primarily sold to distributors, who then sell to retailers and restaurants.  Consolidation at the distributor and retail level has increased which has added competitive pressure to increase marketing and sales spending and constrain pricing.  As permitted under federal and local regulations, Crimson has also been placing increasing emphasis on direct sales to consumers, which they are able to do through the internet, wine clubs and at the wineries’ tasting rooms.  During 2011, direct sales to consumers represented 15% of case sales and 39% of wine revenues.  Seghesio Family Vineyards has historically sold approximately 19% of its production to international markets, which Crimson expects to continue and expand with the export of products from its other wineries.




Crimson’s wines compete with small and large producers in the U.S., as well as with imported wines, and the ultimate consumer has many choices.  Demand for wine in the premium, ultra premium and luxury market segments can rise and fall with general economic conditions, and is also significantly affected by grape supply.  The demand for Crimson’s products is also affected by the ratings given the wines in industry and consumer publications.  In the current economic climate, consumer demand has shifted away from the higher-priced luxury segment to wines in the lower-priced premium and ultra premium categories.  Crimson’s production, sales and distribution activities are subject to regulation by agencies of both federal and state governments.




Energy Projects

 

    During the past few years, the Company has been incurring costs to investigate and evaluate the development of a number of large scale domestic energy projects.  These projects plan to use gasification technology to convert different types of low grade fossil fuels into clean energy products.  The Company has also invested in certain energy projects that do not plan to use gasification technologies.  The Company has expensed costs to investigate, evaluate and obtain various permits and approvals for its various energy projects of $33,964,000, $27,220,000 and $25,343,000 during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.




Although there are a number of large scale projects the Company is currently investigating, the Company is not obligated to develop any of the projects, and no assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in fully developing any of these projects.  Any project that the Company might develop would likely require a significant equity investment, which the Company presently does not intend to fund by itself, the acquisition of substantial non-recourse borrowings to build the projects (total development costs for these types of projects range from $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion), the procurement of purchase commitments for long-term supplies of feedstock, long-term commitments from purchasers of the output, various permits and regulatory approvals and significant technological and engineering expertise to implement.  The investigation, evaluation and financing of these large scale projects will take years to complete.




The Company is currently evaluating the development of a gasification project which would be built in Louisiana by the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Lake Charles Cogeneration LLC (“LCC”), for an estimated total cost of between $2,300,000,000 and $2,600,000,000.  LCC has been awarded $1,561,000,000 in tax exempt bonds to support the development of the project, which would be issued by the Lake Charles Harbor and Terminal District of Lake Charles, Louisiana, $128,000,000 of investment tax credits and received a $260,000,000 federal government grant for carbon capture and sequestration.  Receipt of these awards and grants are contingent upon satisfaction of numerous regulatory and other conditions.  The Company is not obligated to make equity contributions to LCC until it completes its investigation, the project is approved by the Company’s Board of Directors and significant financing has been obtained from third parties which has not been arranged.  The Lake Charles Cogeneration project is a new chemical manufacturing facility that plans to use proven quench gasification technology to produce various products from petroleum coke, a low grade solid fuel source.  LCC is evaluating the primary product options to be produced by the Lake Charles Cogeneration project, including methanol and hydrogen, and has signed two letters of intent for the majority of its production.  LCC has also entered into a 20-year contract for the sale of its entire carbon dioxide by-product stream which would be used for enhanced oil recovery.




  



17







  







In July 2009, two of the Company’s other prospective gasification projects, one in Indiana and the other in Mississippi, were selected by the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) to proceed to detailed due diligence and negotiations of terms and conditions necessary for the DOE to issue conditional commitments for loan guarantees aggregating up to $3,600,000,000.  While these commitments represent important milestones in the selection process, the guarantees are subject to detailed and extensive due diligence by the DOE and no assurance can be given that a loan guaranty for either project will ultimately be given.

 

    A subsidiary of the Company acquired a leasehold interest and certain permits to construct and operate an onshore liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) terminal and associated facilities in Warrenton, Oregon.  The project would include construction of an offshore dock and berth and onshore facilities to store up to 480,000 cubic meters of LNG.  The current plan includes construction of an approximate 121 mile long natural gas pipeline to connect to the U.S. natural gas transmission grid.  Due to the recent increases in U.S. natural gas production, LNG receiving and storage facilities now only play a role in niche markets, where insufficient pipeline infrastructure can create short-term shortages, and the Company is evaluating whether a facility focused on LNG exports would provide better returns.  Numerous regulatory permits and approvals and acquisitions of rights of way for the pipeline will be required before project construction can commence; construction of the terminal and associated facilities could potentially begin early in 2014.  Completion of the project is also subject to obtaining significant financing from third parties, which has not been arranged.




Other Investments




Berkadia




Berkadia, a joint venture between Berkshire Hathaway and the Company, acquired a commercial mortgage origination and servicing business in December 2009.  The Company and Berkshire Hathaway each have a 50% equity interest in Berkadia, and each party contributed $217,169,000 of equity capital to fund the acquisition.  At December 31, 2011, the net book value of the Company’s investment in Berkadia was $193,496,000.

 

Berkadia is a servicer of commercial real estate loans in the U.S., performing primary, master and special servicing functions for U.S. government agency programs, commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions (“CMBS”), banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions.  Berkadia is an approved servicer of loans for Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae and the FHA.  As of December 31, 2011, Berkadia serviced approximately 25,000 loans with an unpaid principal balance of $190 billion.




A primary servicer of a loan is the primary contact with the borrower and is generally responsible for carrying out all cash management functions relating to the loan, including providing monthly billing statements to the borrower and collecting and applying payments on the loan; administering reserve and escrow funds for repairs, tenant improvements, taxes and insurance; obtaining and analyzing operating and financial statements of the borrower and performing periodic property inspections; preparing and providing periodic reports and remittances to the master servicer or other designated persons; administering lien filings; and other specified functions.




A master servicer is responsible for administration of a pool of loans that is transferred to a trust or other special purpose entity in connection with a securitization transaction pursuant to a pooling and servicing agreement.  While some master servicer functions may be sub-contracted and performed by a primary servicer, as a master servicer Berkadia is ultimately responsible for the performance of any functions that have been sub-contracted to a primary servicer.  Master servicers are generally required to advance funds to cover any delinquent payments on the securitized loans and any taxes and insurance premiums not paid by borrowers or covered by borrowers’ escrow funds, provided that the servicer determines that the advances will be recoverable from loan payments or liquidation proceeds in the future.  These “servicing advances,” along with accrued interest, are treated as having priority over the rights of other investors in the securitization.




  



18







  







A special servicer is a specialist in dealing with defaulted loans and is usually selected by the holder of the subordinated interest in a securitization vehicle.  Typically, a loan may be transferred from the master servicer to a special servicer if it is more than 60 days delinquent, a borrower files for bankruptcy or the master servicer determines a default is imminent.  Once a loan is transferred to special servicing, asset managers take steps to bring the account to a performing status or exercise other remedies, including loan modification, foreclosure, a negotiated pay-off or a sale of the loan.  Special servicers are generally paid higher monthly servicing fees and resolution fees in connection with the loans that they service.




As a servicer, Berkadia is frequently responsible for managing, on behalf of its investors, the balances that are maintained in custodial accounts for the purposes of collecting and distributing principal and interest and for funding repairs, tenant improvements, taxes and insurance related to the mortgaged properties it services.  Berkadia derives certain economic benefits from investing these custodial accounts.  Such balances totaled in excess of $4 billion as of December 31, 2011.

 

Berkadia originates commercial real estate loans for Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae and the FHA using their underwriting guidelines, and will typically sell the loan shortly after it is funded.  Provided Berkadia adheres to their guidelines, these government related entities must purchase the loan at the face amount plus accrued interest; Berkadia retains the mortgage servicing rights.  In addition, as a condition to Fannie Mae’s delegation of responsibility for underwriting, originating and servicing of loans, Berkadia assumes a limited first-dollar and shared loss position throughout the term of each loan sold to Fannie Mae.

 

During 2011, Berkadia commenced originating commercial mortgage loans which are not part of the government agency programs.  Berkadia has a portfolio of loans that provide interim financing to borrowers who intend to refinance the loan with longer-term loans from an eligible government agency or other third party (“Bridge loans”).  Berkadia may also from time to originate loans intended to be conveyed into CMBS transactions sponsored by third parties (“CMBS loans”).  Bridge loans are typically floating rate loans with 2 to 3 year maturities; CMBS loans are typically 10 year fixed rate loans that Berkadia intends to hold for 3 to 6 months pending sale to a securitization vehicle.  At December 31, 2011, $310,000,000 of such loans were outstanding, substantially all of which were Bridge loans.

 

Berkadia is required under its servicing agreements to maintain certain minimum servicer ratings or qualifications from the rating agencies.  A downgrade below a certain level may give rise to the right of a customer or trustee of a securitized transaction to terminate Berkadia as servicer.  Berkadia currently maintains approvals or ratings from Moody’s Investors Service, Fitch Ratings, Standard & Poor’s and Dominion Bond Rating Services.  These ratings currently exceed the minimum ratings required by the related servicing agreements.  Ratings issued by the rating agencies can be withdrawn or lowered at any time.  In addition, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac retain broad discretion to terminate Berkadia as a seller/servicer without cause upon notice.




Jefferies




The Company owns 58,006,024 Jefferies common shares (approximately 28.2% of the Jefferies outstanding common shares) for a total investment of $980,109,000.  The Company’s investment in Jefferies is classified as an investment in an associated company and is carried at fair value, which was $797,583,000 at December 31, 2011.  Jefferies has entered into a registration rights agreement covering all of the Jefferies common stock owned by the Company.  Jefferies is a full-service global investment bank and institutional securities firm serving companies and their investors.

Mueller




During 2011, the Company acquired 10,422,859 common shares of Mueller, representing approximately 27.3% of the outstanding common shares of Mueller, for aggregate cash consideration of $408,558,000.  Mueller is a leading manufacturer of copper, brass, plastic, and aluminum products.  Detailed financial and other information about Mueller may be found on its website (www.muellerindustries.com).  In September 2011, the Company entered into a standstill agreement with Mueller for the two year period ending September 1, 2013, pursuant to which, among other things, subject to certain provisions the Company has agreed not to sell its shares if the buyer would own more than 4.9% of the outstanding shares, and not to increase its ownership interest to more than 27.5% of the outstanding Mueller common shares.  In addition, the Company has the right to nominate two directors to the board of directors of Mueller and Mueller has agreed to give the Company registration rights covering all of the Mueller shares of common stock owned by the Company.  Detailed financial and other information about Mueller may be found on its website (www.muellerindustries.com).




The Company elected the fair value option to account for its investment in Mueller rather than the equity method of accounting.  Income (losses) related to associated companies includes unrealized losses resulting from changes in the fair value of Mueller of $8,112,000 for the year ended December 31, 2011.  At December 31, 2011, the Company’s investment in Mueller was $400,446,000.




JHYH




During 2007, the Company and Jefferies formed JHYH and each initially committed to invest $600,000,000.  The Company invested $350,000,000 during 2007; any request for additional capital contributions from the Company requires the consent of the Company’s designees to the Jefferies board.  The Company does not anticipate making additional capital contributions.  JHYH owns Jefferies High Yield Trading, LLC (“JHYT”), a registered broker-dealer that is engaged in the secondary sales and trading of high yield securities and special situation securities, including bank debt, post-reorganization equity, public and private equity, equity derivatives, credit default swaps and other financial instruments.  JHYT makes markets in high yield and distressed securities and provides research coverage on these types of securities.  JHYT does not invest or make markets in sub-prime residential mortgage securities.




Jefferies and the Company each have the right to nominate two of a total of four directors to JHYH’s board, and each own 50% of the voting securities.  The organizational documents also permit passive investors to invest up to $800,000,000 in JHYH.  Jefferies also received additional JHYH securities entitling it to 20% of the profits.  The voting and non-voting interests are entitled to a pro rata share of the balance of the profits of JHYH, and are mandatorily redeemable in 2013, with a mutual option to extend up to three additional one-year periods.  For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company recorded pre-tax income from this investment of $11,211,000, $20,053,000 and $37,249,000, respectively, under the equity method of accounting; at December 31, 2011, the Company’s investment in JHYH was $323,262,000.




Linkem




During 2011, the Company acquired approximately 37% of the common shares of Linkem, a wireless broadband services provider in Italy, for aggregate cash consideration of $88,575,000.  Linkem was established in 2001 to provide wireless broadband services to Italian consumers and in 2003 became the first national airport WiFi operator in Italy.  Subsequently, Linkem expanded its wireless networks to provide WiFi services over wider coverage areas. 




In 2008, Linkem acquired wireless spectrum licenses in the 3.5GHz band and launched Italy’s first commercial 4G wireless service.  Linkem’s 4G service offers a variety of lower-cost options for broadband services on customer premises.  Unlike the U.S. and most of Western Europe, Italy does not have a national cable television system; as a result, Italy’s broadband penetration rate is among the lowest in Europe, and substantially all broadband services are provided using legacy copper telephone lines.




  



20







  







Linkem’s wireless spectrum licenses can provide geographic coverage to all of Italy.  Linkem has signed agreements with several large telecommunication companies for the use of their infrastructure, providing Linkem access to approximately 16,000 wireless towers throughout Italy.  At December 31, 2011, Linkem’s network includes over 600 wireless towers that can reach approximately 9 million people; Linkem has over 33,000 subscribers for its services.   Linkem plans to increase its network coverage across Italy over the next few years as it adds subscribers; expansion and customer acquisition costs are expected to result in operating losses over the next few years.  The Company accounts for Linkem under the equity method of accounting and at December 31, 2011, the net book value of Company’s investment was $86,332,000.




Garcadia




Garcadia is a joint venture between the Company and Garff Enterprises, Inc. (“Garff”) pursuant to which Garcadia has acquired various automobile dealerships.  The Garcadia joint venture agreement specifies that the Company and Garff shall have equal board representation and equal votes on all matters affecting Garcadia, and that all cash flows from Garcadia will be allocated 65% to the Company and 35% to Garff, with the exception of one dealership from which the Company receives 83% of all cash flows.  Garcadia’s strategy is to acquire automobile dealerships in secondary market locations meeting its specified return criteria.  At December 31, 2011, Garcadia owned 17 dealerships comprised of domestic and foreign automobile makers.  The Company has received cash distributions of fees and earnings aggregating $10,382,000, $8,778,000 and $6,137,000 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  In addition, the Company owns the land for certain dealerships and leases it to the dealerships for rent aggregating $5,654,000, $5,062,000 and $4,971,000 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  At December 31, 2011, the Company’s investment in Garcadia (excluding the land) was classified as an investment in associated company with a carrying value of $72,303,000.

 
 

Fortescue




During 2006 and 2007, the Company invested an aggregate of $452,247,000 in Fortescue’s Pilbara iron ore and infrastructure project in Western Australia, including expenses.  In exchange for its cash investment, the Company received 277,986,000 common shares of Fortescue, and a $100,000,000 unsecured note of FMG that matures in August 2019.  During 2010 and 2011, the Company sold an aggregate of 147,400,000 common shares of Fortescue for net cash proceeds of $853,715,000, which resulted in the recognition of net securities gains of $723,115,000, reducing its interest in Fortescue to 130,586,000 common shares.  The Company’s investment in the Fortescue common shares is classified as a non-current available for sale investment and carried at market value as of each balance sheet date.  At December 31, 2011, the market value of the Fortescue common shares was $569,256,000.  In January 2012, the Company sold 100,000,000 Fortescue common shares for net cash proceeds of $506,490,000.




Interest on the FMG Note is calculated as 4% of the revenue, net of government royalties, invoiced from the iron ore produced from the project’s Cloud Break and Christmas Creek areas, payable semi-annually within 30 days of June 30th and December 31st of each year.  The Company recorded interest income before withholding taxes on the FMG Note of $214,455,000, $149,257,000 and $66,079,000 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  The ultimate value of the FMG Note will depend on the volume of iron ore shipped and iron ore prices over the remaining term of the FMG Note, which can fluctuate widely, as well as the outcome of the litigation described below.




In August 2010, the Company was advised that Fortescue is asserting that FMG is entitled to issue additional notes identical to the FMG Note in an unlimited amount.  Fortescue further claims that any interest to be paid on additional notes can dilute, on a pro rata basis, the Company’s entitlement to the stated interest of 4% of net revenue.  The Company does not believe that FMG has the right to issue additional notes which affect the Company’s interest or that the interpretation by Fortescue of the terms of the FMG Note, as currently claimed by Fortescue, reflects the agreement between the parties.




  



21







  







On September 1, 2010, the Company filed a Writ of Summons against Fortescue, FMG and Fortescue’s then Chief Executive Officer in the Supreme Court of Western Australia.  The Writ of Summons seeks, among other things, an injunction restraining the issuance of any additional notes identical to the FMG Note and damages.  If the litigation is ultimately determined adversely to the Company and additional notes are issued, the Company’s future cash flows from the FMG Note and future results of operations would be significantly and adversely affected to the extent of the dilution resulting from the issuance of such additional notes.




The project information presented in the paragraphs below was obtained from Fortescue’s website, (www.fmgl.com.au), which contains substantial additional information about Fortescue, its operating activities and the project.  Fortescue shipped its first iron ore in May 2008 and for the year ending December 31, 2011, Fortescue’s total revenue from iron ore sales was $6,189,560,000.




Fortescue announced reserve estimates for the Cloud Break and Christmas Creek areas, which are net of mine depletion and ore recovery, include 38 million metric tons of proved iron ore reserves and 1.51 billion metric tons of probable iron ore reserves, in accordance with the Australasian Joint Ore Reserves Committee code.  This reserve estimate is solely for these two areas, which cover an area of approximately 770 square kilometers.  Fortescue has additional tenements in the Pilbara region of Western Australia and has since announced reserve estimates for some of its other tenements.  Mining revenues derived from tenements other than Cloud Break and Christmas Creek do not increase the interest payable to the Company on the FMG Note.




In 2011, Fortescue completed an expansion of its Cloud Break and Christmas Creek operations which will enable it to produce 55 million metric tons per annum.  In 2010, Fortescue announced a further expansion to increase its mining plan to 155 million metric tons per annum, of which 90 million metric tons per annum would come from Cloud Break and Christmas Creek.  For the year ended December 31, 2011, Fortescue sold 46.5 million metric tons of iron ore, entirely from Cloud Break and Christmas Creek.  Fortescue, along with the other major iron ore producers, charges its customers prices based on an index pricing regime that reflects recent iron ore spot prices.

 

    In addition to the Company’s investment and equity investments from other parties, Fortescue initially raised $2,051,000,000 of senior secured debt to fund the construction of its infrastructure, which included a 260 kilometer railroad, port and related port infrastructure at Port Hedland, Australia, as well as a crushing and screening plant, access roads and other infrastructure at the mine site.  Subsequently, Fortescue raised additional debt to fund expansion activities.  At December 31, 2011, Fortescue had $5,000,000,000 of senior unsecured notes outstanding.




Inmet




Inmet is a Canadian-based global mining company traded on the Toronto stock exchange (Symbol: IMN).  In August 2005, the Company sold to Inmet a 70% interest in Cobre Las Cruces, a Spanish company that holds the exploration and mineral rights to the Las Cruces copper deposit in the Pyrite Belt of Spain, in exchange for 5,600,000 common shares of Inmet.  In November 2010, the Company sold to Inmet its remaining 30% equity interest in and subordinated sponsor loans to Las Cruces for aggregate consideration of $576,000,000.  The purchase price was comprised of $150,000,000 of cash and 5,442,413 newly issued common shares of Inmet; the Company reported a gain on the sale of $383,369,000 in investment and other income.  At December 31, 2011, the Company owns a total of 11,042,413 Inmet common shares which are reflected on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at market value of $708,193,000 (approximately 15.9% of Inmet’s outstanding common shares).  The Inmet shares have registration rights and may be sold in accordance with applicable securities laws.  Detailed financial and other information about Inmet may be found on its website (www.inmetmining.com).

Item 1A.  Risk Factors.

 

    Our business is subject to a number of risks.  You should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Report, before you decide whether to purchase our common stock.  The risks set out below are not the only risks we face.  If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.




Future acquisitions and dispositions of our operations and investments are possible, changing the components of our assets and liabilities, and if unsuccessful could reduce the value of our common shares.  Any future acquisitions or dispositions may result in significant changes in the composition of our assets and liabilities. Consequently, our financial condition, results of operations and the trading price of our common shares may be affected by factors different from those affecting our financial condition, results of operations and trading price at the present time.




We are dependent on certain key personnel.  We are dependent on the services of Ian M. Cumming and Joseph S. Steinberg, our Chairman of the Board and President, respectively.  Messrs. Cumming’s and Steinberg’s employment agreements with us expire June 30, 2015.  These individuals are also significant shareholders of our Company.  As of February 16, 2012, Messrs. Cumming and Steinberg and trusts for the benefit of their respective families (excluding certain private charitable foundations) beneficially owned approximately 9.0% and 10.0% of our outstanding common shares, respectively.  Accordingly, Messrs. Cumming and Steinberg exert significant influence over all matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including the election or removal of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions.




We operate in a variety of industries and market sectors, all of which are very competitive and susceptible to economic downturns and have been adversely affected by recent economic conditions.  The Company operates in industries that sell commodity products and services, including beef processing, manufacturing and oil and gas drilling services, all of which are very competitive with product pricing often being the most significant factor to customers.  Certain industries have seen a consolidation of the customer base, which tends to increase competition and pricing pressure.  In addition, starting in 2008, the recession and general economic conditions have adversely affected operating results in the manufacturing, oil and gas drilling services, gaming entertainment and domestic real estate segments, which is likely to continue until the economy recovers.  The performance of these business units during this period has resulted in a lower valuation for these businesses, and a worsening of general economic or market conditions could result in a further deterioration in the values of our businesses or investments.

The prices and availability of key raw materials affects the profitability of our beef processing and manufacturing operations, and also impacts Sangart’s ability to conduct its clinical trials.  The supply and market price of cattle purchased by National Beef are dependent upon a variety of factors over which National Beef has little or no control, including fluctuations in the size of herds maintained by producers, the relative cost of feed and energy, weather and livestock diseases.  Sangart has access to sufficient raw materials to conduct its clinical trials; however, it has not secured commitments for sufficient raw materials for a commercial launch, which would also require additional investments in manufacturing capacity.  The cost of polypropylene, the principal raw material used by Conwed Plastics, has increased by approximately 20% over the last three years, a continuing trend that started in 2002.  The price of polypropylene has historically fluctuated with the price of oil and natural gas but growing economies in China and India have resulted in increased demand and impacted prices.  Although the Company’s operating subsidiaries are not currently experiencing any shortage of raw materials, if the subsidiaries experience shortages, revenues and profitability could decline.

 

    Outbreaks of disease affecting livestock can adversely affect the supply of cattle and the demand for National Beef’s products.  National Beef is subject to risks relating to animal health and disease control.  An outbreak of disease affecting livestock (such as foot-and-mouth disease or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (“BSE”), commonly referred to as mad cow disease) could result in restrictions on sales of products, restrictions on purchases of livestock from suppliers or widespread destruction of cattle.  The discovery of BSE in the past caused certain countries to restrict or prohibit the importation of beef products.  Outbreaks of diseases, or the perception by the public that an outbreak has occurred, or other concerns regarding diseases, can lead to inadequate supply, cancellation of orders by customers and create adverse publicity, any of which can have a significant negative impact on consumer demand and, as a result, on the Company’s consolidated financial position, cash flows and results of operations.

 

    If National Beef’s products or products made by others using its products become contaminated or are alleged to be contaminated, National Beef may be subject to product liability claims that would adversely affect its business.  National Beef may be subject to significant liability in excess of insurance policy limits if its products or products made by others using its products causes injury, illness or death.  In addition, National Beef could recall or be required to recall products that are, or are alleged to be, contaminated, spoiled or inappropriately labeled.  Organisms producing food borne illnesses (such as E. coli) could be present in National Beef’s products and result in illness or death if they are not eliminated through further processing or cooking.  Contamination of National Beef’s or its competitors’ products may create adverse publicity or cause consumers to lose confidence in the safety and quality of beef products.  Allegations of product contamination may also be harmful even if they are untrue or result from third-party tampering.  Any of these events may increase costs or decrease demand for beef products, any of which could have a significant adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

 

    National Beef generally does not enter into long-term contracts with customers; as a result the volumes and prices at which beef products are sold are subject to market forces. National Beef’s customers generally place orders for products on an as-needed basis and, as a result, their order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future. The loss of one or more significant customers, a significant decline in the volume of orders from customers or a significant decrease in beef product prices for a sustained period of time could negatively impact cash flows and results of operations.




National Beef’s international operations expose it to political and economic risks in foreign countries, as well as to risks related to currency fluctuations. Approximately 12% of National Beef’s annual sales are export sales, primarily to Mexico, Japan, South Korea, Canada, China (for hides), Hong Kong, Egypt, and Taiwan, and on average these sales have a higher margin than domestic sales of similar products.  A reduction in international sales could adversely affect revenues and margins.  Risks associated with international activities include inflation or deflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates, including changes in currency exchange rates of other countries that may export beef products in competition with National Beef; the closing of borders by foreign countries to product imports due to disease or other perceived health or food safety issues; exchange controls; changes in tariffs; changes in political or economic conditions; trade restrictions and changes in regulatory requirements.  The occurrence of any of these events could increase costs, lower demand for products or limit operations, which could have a significant adverse effect on cash flows, results of operations and future prospects.

National Beef incurs substantial costs to comply with environmental regulations and could incur additional costs as a result of new regulations or compliance failures that result in civil or criminal penalties, liability for damages and negative publicity.  National Beef’s operations are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent environmental regulations administered by the EPA and state, local and other authorities with regards to water usage, wastewater and storm water discharge, air emissions and odor, and waste management and disposal.  Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have serious consequences, including criminal, civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity.  In addition, National Beef incurs and will continue to incur significant capital and operating expenditures to comply with existing and new or more stringent regulations and requirements.  All of National Beef’s processing facilities procure wastewater treatment services from municipal or other regional governmental agencies that are in turn subject to environmental laws and permit limits regarding their water discharges.  As permit limits are becoming more stringent, upgrades and capital improvements to these municipal treatment facilities are likely.  In locations where National Beef is a significant volume discharger, it could be asked to contribute toward the costs of such upgrades or to pay significantly increased water or sewer charges to recoup such upgrade costs.  National Beef may also be required to undertake upgrades and make capital improvements to its own wastewater pretreatment facilities, the cost of which could be significant.  Compliance with environmental regulations has had and will continue to have a significant impact on National Beef’s cash flows, margins and profitability.  In addition, under most environmental laws, most notably the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and analogous state laws, National Beef could be held liable for the cost to investigate or remediate any contamination at properties it owns or operates, or as to which it arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances, as such liability is imposed without regard to fault.

 

National Beef’s operating results could be negatively impacted by hedging and derivative positions. National Beef uses derivative financial instruments and other strategies in an attempt to reduce exposure to various market risks, including changes in commodity prices.  These positions do not qualify as hedges for financial reporting purposes and are marked to fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in earnings.  Losses on these instruments will negatively impact reported operating results and the use of such instruments may limit National Beef’s ability to benefit from favorable commodity price movements.

 

Failure by Wal-Mart and its affiliates to continue purchasing from National Beef could have a significant adverse effect on our sales. Sales to Wal-Mart Stores and its affiliate, Sam’s Club, represented approximately 9% of National Beef’s total net sales during its last fiscal year.  Wal-Mart recently requested that its beef suppliers, including National Beef, submit a proposal for future business.  If Wal-Mart and its affiliates do not continue to purchase from National Beef, it could have a significant adverse effect on results of operations.

 

National Beef is subject to extensive governmental regulation and noncompliance with or changes in applicable requirements could adversely affect its business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. National Beef’s operations are subject to extensive regulation and oversight by the USDA, FSIS, GIPSA, the FDA, and other state, local and foreign authorities regarding the processing, packaging, storage, safety, distribution, advertising and labeling of its products.  Recently, food safety practices and procedures in the meat processing industry have been subject to more intense scrutiny and oversight by the USDA.  National Beef is also subject to a variety of immigration, labor and worker safety laws and regulations, including those relating to the hiring and retention of employees.  Failure to comply with existing or new laws and regulations could result in administrative penalties and injunctive relief, civil remedies, fines, interruption of operations, recalls of products or seizures of properties, potential criminal sanctions and personal injury or other damage claims. These remedies, changes in the applicable laws and regulations or discovery of currently unknown conditions could increase costs, limit business operations and reduce profitability.

National Beef’s performance depends on favorable labor relations with its employees, in particular employees represented by collective bargaining agreements. A substantial number of National Beef’s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.  A labor-related work stoppage by unionized employees, or employees who become unionized in the future, could limit National Beef’s ability to process and ship products or could increase costs.  Any significant increase in labor costs, deterioration of employee relations, slowdowns or work stoppages at any of National Beef’s locations, whether due to union activities, employee turnover or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.




Declines in the U.S. housing market have reduced revenues and profitability of our manufacturing businesses and may continue to do so.  Our manufacturing operations, in particular Idaho Timber, have generated significant revenues when the U.S. housing market was strong.  The weak U.S. housing market during the last few years has resulted in fewer new housing starts, which has adversely impacted revenues and profitability at Idaho Timber and Conwed Plastics.  Idaho Timber does not expect to return to prior levels of profitability until the U.S. housing market recovers.




Keen’s revenues and profitability are impacted by natural gas and oil supplies and prices and the supply of drilling rigs in the marketplace.  During periods of decreased demand for natural gas and oil, Keen’s rig utilization will decline and Keen’s competitors may also have excess capacity in the marketplace, which adversely impacts Keen’s revenues and profitability.




The nature of Keen’s operating activities can be hazardous, and accidents can cause personal injury or death, damage to Keen’s equipment and/or environmental damage.  These hazards are inherent in the contract drilling business, and if Keen is not fully protected through insurance coverage or indemnification from its customers any such accidents could adversely impact Keen’s profitability.  Keen maintains insurance coverage and has indemnification agreements with many of its customers; however, there is no assurance that such insurance or indemnification agreements would adequately protect Keen against liability or loss from all consequences of any accidents.  Additionally, Keen may not be able to purchase insurance economically.




New technologies and aging equipment could cause Keen’s drilling equipment and methods to become less competitive, resulting in reduced profitability or a requirement to make significant capital investments to remain competitive.  Improvements in drilling technology and aging equipment could cause Keen to become less competitive, lose business, suffer reduced profitability or result in impairment charges with respect to its drilling equipment.




The Hard Rock Biloxi is dependent upon patronage of persons living in the Gulf Coast region. The Hard Rock Biloxi primarily seeks to attract patrons from its local geographic area.  Downturns in local and regional economic conditions, an increase in competition in the surrounding area and interruptions caused by hurricanes could negatively impact operating results.




We may not be able to insure certain risks economically.  We cannot be certain that we will be able to insure all risks that we desire to insure economically or that all of our insurers or reinsurers will be financially viable if we make a claim.  If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits should occur, or if the Company is required to pay a deductible for an insured loss, results of operations could be adversely affected.  Premier has been severely damaged by hurricanes in the past, and it is possible that storms could cause significant damage in the future.  Damages from storms could result in Premier closing its facility to make repairs, resulting in lost business and adversely affecting results of operations.




  



26







  







Increases in mortgage interest rate levels, the lack of available consumer credit and the depressed real estate market have reduced and may continue to reduce consumer demand for certain of our real estate development projects and result in impairment charges.  Due to current depressed economic conditions in the national real estate market, most of the Company’s real estate development projects are not being marketed for sale.  If the Company begins to market its development projects in the future, the ability to successfully attract customers will be highly dependent upon consumers’ ability to finance real estate purchases with affordable loans.  If the Company is unable to realize its projected cash flows for its development projects, impairment charges are likely.




Sangart is subject to extensive government regulation, cannot generate any revenue without regulatory approval of its products and is also subject to all of the risks inherent in establishing a new business.  Although funds invested in Sangart are generally expensed by Sangart when spent, the Company cannot be assured that it will ever receive a return on its investment due to the risky nature of Sangart’s development activities.  Clinical trials of Sangart’s product candidates are not complete, the products have not been approved for sale by regulatory authorities and there is a risk that its products may never prove effective or be approved.




Sangart’s success depends on its ability to obtain, maintain, renew and defend patent protection for its products and technologies, preserve trade secrets and operate without infringing on the intellectual property rights of others.  The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies, such as Sangart, are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions.  If Sangart’s intellectual property positions are challenged, invalidated, circumvented or expire, or if Sangart fails to maintain or renew its third-party intellectual property licenses in good standing, its ability to successfully bring MP4 products to market would be adversely affected, it could incur monetary liabilities or be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute.




Sangart will require significant additional funding for product development and clinical trial activities prior to regulatory approval and commercial launch; the source of such funding has not been identified.  The Company expects to provide Sangart with sufficient capital during 2012.  Sangart has had discussions with third-party investors; however, no agreements have been reached and if such agreements are entered into it would likely result in significant dilution of the Company’s interest.  The Company has not determined whether it will continue to provide funds to Sangart and if so how much it will provide.  If Sangart is not provided with additional funds from either the Company or other sources when needed, it is unlikely that the Company will ever realize any significant return of its invested capital.




The Company has incurred costs to investigate and evaluate the development of a number of large scale energy projects; however, development of these projects is subject to obtaining significant third-party debt and equity financing, regulatory approvals, the procurement of purchase commitments for long-term supplies of feedstock and securing long-term commitments from purchasers of the output.  Although the Company has spent significant amounts investigating large scale energy projects, it will not be able to develop these projects without financing from other sources, various regulatory approvals and commitments from third-parties.  The timing of the commencement of construction of any project is also dependent upon the receipt of financing and regulatory approvals.  If the Company is unable to obtain such financing, approvals or commitments, it will not be able to recover its investment.




If Berkadia does not maintain certain specified ratings from the credit rating agencies it could lose its mortgage servicing rights.  Berkadia is required to maintain specified ratings from the credit rating agencies, and failure to do so would give its customers the right to terminate their mortgage servicing agreements.  If mortgage servicing agreements were terminated as a result of a credit ratings downgrade, the Company could lose its entire equity investment.




  



27







  







When Berkadia originates loans for Fannie Mae, it is often required to share in the losses on such loans, which could be in excess of reserved amounts.  Berkadia carries a reserve on its balance sheet for contingent losses on loans originated for Fannie Mae that have loss sharing requirements.  If actual losses exceed amounts reserved, Berkadia’s profitability and cash flows will be reduced.




The loss of or changes in Berkadia’s relationships with U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprises and federal agencies would have an adverse effect on Berkadia’s business.  Berkadia’s failure to comply with the applicable U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprise or agency may result in its termination as an approved seller/servicer, mortgagee or issuer.  The loss of any such status could have a significant adverse impact on Berkadia’s results of operations, could result in a loss of similar approvals from other U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprises or federal agencies and could have other adverse consequences to the business.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac retain broad discretion to terminate Berkadia as a seller/servicer without cause upon notice.




Changes in existing government-sponsored and federal mortgage programs could negatively affect Berkadia’s business.  Berkadia’s ability to generate income through mortgage sales to institutional investors depends in part on programs sponsored by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the FHA, which purchase such loans from Berkadia and/or facilitate the issuance of mortgage-backed securities in the secondary market.  The federal government has announced that the continuation of these programs is under review, and that any or all of the government agency programs could be substantially modified or eliminated in the future.  Any discontinuation of, or significant reduction or change in, the operation of those programs would have an adverse effect on Berkadia’s loan origination and servicing business and results of operations.  




Berkadia’s special servicing and fee-for-service businesses may be terminated on short notice.  Special servicing for each CMBS transaction is usually controlled by the subordinated bond holder class of the securitization.  The owners of the subordinated bonds may change from time to time, and subordinated bond holders may replace Berkadia with a different special servicer.  Fee-for-service customers are permitted to terminate Berkadia on short notice, usually 30 days.  If Berkadia loses special servicing rights or is terminated by fee-for-service customers, it would negatively impact Berkadia’s results of operations and cash flows.




CMBS loan and Bridge loan programs will expose Berkadia to credit and interest rate risk that it is not subject to with its government agency lending programs.  Unlike its government agency lending programs, Berkadia cannot be assured it will be able to sell CMBS and Bridge loans at par value to a third-party without any exposure to credit or interest rate risk.  If for any reason Berkadia is unable to sell a CMBS loan into the securitization market or if a borrower is unable to refinance a Bridge loan, Berkadia will retain all risks associated with such loan for as long as it owns the loan.  Berkadia may be forced to foreclose on defaulted loans and suffer a loss, or to sell loans to a third party at a discount, either of which would reduce Berkadia’s profitability and cash flows. 




If Berkadia suffered significant losses and was unable to repay its commercial paper borrowings, the Company would be exposed to loss pursuant to a reimbursement obligation to Berkshire Hathaway.  Berkadia obtains funds generated by commercial paper sales of an affiliate of Berkadia.  All of the proceeds from the commercial paper sales are used by Berkadia to fund new mortgage loans, servicer advances, investments and other working capital requirements.  Repayment of the commercial paper is supported by a $2,500,000,000 surety policy issued by a Berkshire Hathaway insurance subsidiary and corporate guaranty, and the Company has agreed to reimburse Berkshire Hathaway for one-half of any losses incurred thereunder.  If Berkadia suffers significant losses and is unable to repay its commercial paper borrowings, the Company would suffer losses to the extent of its reimbursement obligation to Berkshire Hathaway.  As of December 31, 2011, the aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding was $2,000,000,000.




  



28







  







Berkadia’s business is significantly affected by general economic conditions, particularly in the commercial real estate industry, and could be harmed in the event of a continued economic slowdown, prolonged recession or other market downturn or disruption.  Berkadia’s business and earnings are sensitive to changes in government policies and regulations, changes in interest rates, inflation, deflation, oversupply of real estate properties, fluctuations in the real estate and debt capital markets and developments in national and local economies.  Unfavorable economic conditions could have an adverse effect on Berkadia’s business, including decreasing the demand for new loans and the servicing of loans originated by third parties.




The Company has a substantial investment in Jefferies, an investment banking and securities firm whose operating results are greatly affected by the economy and financial markets.  Turmoil in the equity and credit markets had an adverse effect on the volume and size of transactions Jefferies executes for its customers, resulting in reduced revenues and profitability in its investment banking, asset management and trading activities, as well as losses in its principal trading activities.  Future declines in Jefferies’ operating results caused by these or other conditions could adversely affect the value of the Company’s investment.

 

    New financial legislation could affect the market value of the Company’s investment in Jefferies.  Recently adopted legislation in the U.S. will result in more comprehensive regulation of the financial services industry.  Such regulation could have an adverse impact on the market value of the Company’s investment in Jefferies.  Jefferies is also subject to certain specific risks which could impact the value of the Company’s investment; these risks are disclosed in Jefferies’ filings with the SEC.

 

    The Company has a substantial investment in Mueller, a manufacturer of copper, brass, plastic, and aluminum products whose operating results are greatly impacted by raw material costs, economic conditions in the housing and commercial construction industries and general overall economic conditions.  Mueller’s products are impacted by the prices of certain commodities used as raw materials and energy costs, which have been volatile.  Mueller typically attempts to pass cost increases onto its customers but is not always successful.  Mueller’s operating results have also been adversely impacted by general economic conditions particularly in the housing and commercial construction industries.  To the extent Mueller’s operating results are adversely impacted by these and other factors, the value of the Company’s investment in Mueller could decline.  Additional information about risk factors that impact Mueller are disclosed in its filings with the SEC.




The Company has substantial investments in Fortescue and Inmet, entities which are engaged in the mining of base metals (principally iron ore and copper), the prices of which have been volatile and can reduce the value of the Company’s investments.  The value of the Company’s investment in the base metals mining sector rise and fall with the changes in the underlying base metal prices.  In addition, mining operations are often subject to delay and regulatory scrutiny, which can increase costs or delay bringing mines into full production.  Pricing changes and mining delays have a direct impact on the value of the Company’s investments, and could adversely impact results of operations and equity.




The value of the FMG Note could be significantly reduced if the Company loses its litigation against Fortescue.  If the litigation is ultimately determined adversely to the Company and Fortescue issues additional notes, the Company’s future cash flows from the FMG Note and future results of operations would be adversely affected to the extent of the dilution resulting from the issuance of such additional notes, which could be significant.  In addition, depending upon the extent of any such dilution, the Company may have to record an impairment charge for its prepaid mining interest.




Garcadia’s business is dependent, in part, upon revenue from new and used car sales at its dealerships, and declines in revenues due to industry or other factors could result in reduced profitability, reduced cash flows and/or impairment charges.  Garcadia has recorded impairment charges in the past, principally for goodwill and other intangible assets, and if the automobile industry experiences a downturn in the future additional impairment charges are likely.  In addition, reduced revenues would result in reduced profitability and cash flows for the Company.

From time to time the Company may invest in illiquid securities that are subject to standstill agreements or are otherwise restricted.  From time to time the Company may invest in securities that are subject to restrictions which prohibit the Company from selling the subject securities for a period of time.  The Company has entered into a standstill agreement with Mueller for the two year period ending September 1, 2013, pursuant to which, among other things, the Company has agreed not to sell its shares if the buyer would own more than 4.9% of the outstanding shares.  Should the Company need to generate liquidity quickly, the agreement would limit the Company’s ability to dispose of this investment while the agreement is effective.

 

    The Company has significant investments in publicly traded securities and changes in the market prices of these securities, particularly during times of increased volatility in security prices, can have a significant impact on the Company’s investment portfolio, equity and, for certain investments, on results of operations.  The Company has significant investments in publicly traded securities, principally Fortescue, Jefferies, Mueller and Inmet, and in JHYH, an operating business that typically owns publicly traded securities.  Changes in the market values of publicly traded available for sale securities, such as Fortescue and Inmet, are reflected in other comprehensive income (loss) and equity but not in the consolidated statements of operations.  However, changes in the market value of Jefferies and Mueller, for which the Company has elected the fair value option, declines in the fair values of equity securities that the Company deems to be other than temporary, and declines in the fair values of debt securities related to credit losses are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and equity.  The Company’s investment in JHYH is accounted for on the equity method of accounting for which the Company records its share of JHYH’s profits or losses in its consolidated statements of operations.  To the extent that JHYH owns public securities, with changes in market values reflected in its earnings, this increases the Company’s exposure to volatility in the public securities markets.  Global securities markets have been highly volatile, and continued volatility may have a significant negative impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations.

 

    Changes in government tax policies in foreign or domestic jurisdictions where the Company has investments could have an adverse impact on the value of those investments.  The Company has significant investments in both domestic and foreign businesses, where local and national government tax policies in the jurisdictions where those businesses operate could have an adverse impact on the value of those investments.  Government budget deficits may result in legislation to increase or add new taxes on businesses, in particular the domestic financial services and foreign mining sectors.  The Company has equity investments and/or loans to businesses operating in those sectors, and the announcement of unfavorable taxation policy or regulation for those businesses has had and could continue to have an adverse impact on the values of those investments, and reduce cash flows to the Company.




Current economic conditions have adversely affected most of the Company’s operations and investments.  A worsening of current economic conditions or a prolonged recession could cause a decline in estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by certain of the Company’s operations and investments, potentially resulting in impairment charges for long-lived assets.  Certain of the Company’s operating businesses and investments have significant investments in long-lived assets, in particular beef processing, manufacturing, oil and gas drilling services and gaming entertainment.  Current economic conditions have resulted in declining revenues for certain of these operations and their property and equipment is not being fully utilized.  As required, the Company has reviewed certain of these assets and investments for potential impairment, and except as otherwise disclosed has not concluded that the book values of these long-lived assets are not recoverable.  If the operating revenues of these businesses deteriorate in the future, and/or the Company lowers its estimates of future cash flows, impairment charges might have to be recorded.

We could experience significant increases in operating costs and reduced profitability due to competition for skilled management and staff employees in our operating businesses.  The Company competes with many other entities for skilled management and staff employees, including entities that operate in different market sectors than the Company.  Costs to recruit and retain adequate personnel could adversely affect results of operations.




Extreme weather, loss of electrical power or other forces beyond our control could negatively impact our business. Natural disasters, fire, terrorism, pandemic or extreme weather, including droughts, floods, excessive cold or heat, hurricanes or other storms, could interfere with our operating businesses due to power outages, fuel shortages, water shortages, damage to facilities or disruption of transportation channels, among other things.  Any of these factors, as well as disruptions to information systems, could have an adverse effect on financial results.




We rely on the security of our information technology systems and those of our third party providers to protect our proprietary information and information of our customers.  Some of our businesses involve the storage and transmission of customers’ personal information, consumer preferences and credit card information.  While we believe that we have implemented protective measures to effectively secure information and prevent security breaches, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer hacking, computer viruses or other unauthorized attempts by third parties to access the proprietary information of our customers.  Information technology breaches and failures could disrupt our ability to function in the normal course of business resulting in lost revenue, the disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential information and the incurrence of remediation costs, resulting in legal and financial exposure.  Moreover, loss of confidential customer identification information could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under laws that protect confidential personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenues.




From time to time we are subject to litigation, for which we may be unable to accurately assess our level of exposure and which if adversely determined, may have a significant adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.  The Company and its subsidiaries are or may become parties to legal proceedings that are considered to be either ordinary, routine litigation incidental to their business or not significant to the Company’s consolidated financial position or liquidity.  Although the Company’s current assessment is that there is no pending litigation that could have a significant adverse impact, if the Company’s assessment proves to be in error, then the outcome of litigation could have a significant impact on the Company’s financial statements.




We may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to fully realize our deferred tax asset, which would also have to be reduced if U.S. federal income tax rates are lowered.  At December 31, 2011, we have recognized a net deferred tax asset of $1,584,886,000.  If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income, we will not be able to fully realize the recorded amount of the net deferred tax asset.  If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of our NOLs, the NOLs would expire unused.  The Company’s projections of future taxable income required to fully realize the recorded amount of the net deferred tax asset reflect numerous assumptions about our operating businesses and investments, and are subject to change as conditions change specific to our business units, investments or general economic conditions.  Changes that are adverse to the Company could result in the need to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance resulting in a charge to results of operations and a decrease to total stockholders’ equity.  In addition, if U.S. federal income tax rates are lowered, the Company would be required to reduce its net deferred tax asset with a corresponding reduction to earnings during the period.




The payment of dividends in the future is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors.  The Company does not have a regular dividend policy and whether or not to pay any dividends is determined each year by our Board of Directors.

Our common shares are subject to transfer restrictions.  We and certain of our subsidiaries have significant NOLs and other tax attributes, the amount and availability of which are subject to certain qualifications, limitations and uncertainties.  In order to reduce the possibility that certain changes in ownership could result in limitations on the use of the tax attributes, our certificate of incorporation contains provisions that generally restrict the ability of a person or entity from acquiring ownership (including through attribution under the tax law) of 5% or more of our common shares and the ability of persons or entities now owning 5% or more of our common shares from acquiring additional common shares.  The restriction will remain until the earliest of (a) December 31, 2024, (b) the repeal of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (or any comparable successor provision) and (c) the beginning of a taxable year to which these tax benefits may no longer be carried forward.  The restriction may be waived by our Board of Directors on a case by case basis.  Shareholders are advised to carefully monitor their ownership of our common shares and consult their own legal advisors and/or us to determine whether their ownership of our common shares approaches the proscribed level.
