ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings
      The following factors should be considered when reviewing the businesses of PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings. These factors could significantly impact the businesses and cause results to differ materially from those expressed in any statements made by, or on behalf of PSEG, PSE&G, Power or Energy Holdings herein. Some or all of these factors may apply to each of PSEG, PSE&G, Power, Energy Holdings and their respective subsidiaries.
Generation operating performance may fall below projected levels
      Power and Energy Holdings
      Operating generating stations below expected capacity levels, especially at low-cost nuclear and coal facilities, may result in lost revenues and increased expenses, including replacement power costs. Factors that
30



could cause generating station operations to fall below expected levels include, but are not limited to, the following:


•
breakdown or failure of equipment, processes or management effectiveness;

 


•
disruptions in the transmission of electricity;

 


•
labor disputes;

 


•
fuel supply interruptions or transportation constraints;

 


•
limitations which may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements;

 


•
permit limitations; and

 


•
operator error or catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, acts of terrorism or other similar occurrences.

      The potential lost revenues and increased expenses could result in a case where sufficient cash may not be available to service debt. In addition, any prolonged operating performance issues could potentially result in an impairment of the value of the affected facility.
Failure to obtain adequate and timely rate relief could negatively impact results
      PSE&G
      As a public utility, PSE&G's rates are regulated. These rates are designed to allow PSE&G the opportunity to recover its operating expenses and earn a fair return on its rate base, which primarily consists of its property, plant and equipment. These rates include its electric and gas tariff rates that are subject to regulation by the BPU as well as its transmission rates that are subject to regulation by FERC. PSE&G's base rates are set by the BPU for electric distribution and gas distribution and are effective until the time a new rate case is brought to the BPU. These base rate cases generally take place when equity returns fall below reasonable levels. Some categories of costs, such as energy costs, are recovered through adjustment charges that are periodically reset to reflect actual costs. If these
costs exceed the amount included in PSE&G's adjustment charges, there may be a negative impact on cash flows.
      If PSE&G does not obtain adequate rate treatment on a timely basis in order to meet its operating expenses, there may be a negative impact on earnings and operating cash flows. PSE&G can give no assurances that tariff relief will be timely or sufficient for it to recover its costs and provide a sufficient return for its investors.
      Energy Holdings
      Global's distribution facilities are rate-regulated enterprises. Governmental authorities establish rates charged to customers. While these rates are designed to cover all operating costs and provide a return on investment, considerable uncertainties exist in certain countries due to economic, political and social concerns that could have an adverse impact.
      Energy Holdings can give no assurances that rates will, in the future, be sufficient to cover Global's costs and provide a sufficient return on its investments. In addition, future rates may not be adequate to provide cash flow to pay principal and interest on the debt of Global's subsidiaries and affiliates or to enable its subsidiaries and affiliates to comply with the terms of debt agreements.
Inability to balance energy obligations, available supply and trading risks could negatively impact results
      Power and Energy Holdings
      The revenues generated by the operation of the generating stations are subject to market risks that are beyond each company's control. Generation output will either be used to satisfy wholesale contract requirements, other bilateral contracts or be sold into other competitive power markets. Participants in the competitive power markets are not guaranteed any specified rate of return on their capital investments through recovery of mandated rates payable by purchasers of electricity.
      Generation revenues and results of operations are dependent upon prevailing market prices for energy, capacity, ancillary services and fuel supply in the markets served.
31



      Power
      Power's energy trading and marketing activities frequently involve the establishment of forward sale positions in the wholesale energy markets on long-term and short-term bases. To the extent that Power has produced or purchased energy in excess of its contracted obligations a reduction in market prices could reduce profitability.
      Conversely, to the extent that Power has contracted obligations in excess of energy it has produced or purchased, an increase in market prices could reduce profitability.
      If the strategy Power utilizes to hedge its exposures to these various risks is not effective, it could incur significant losses. Power's substantial market positions can also be adversely affected by the level of volatility in the energy markets that, in turn, depends on various factors, including weather in various geographical areas, short-term supply and demand imbalances and pricing differentials at various geographic locations, which cannot be predicted with any certainty.
      Increases in market prices also affect Power's ability to hedge generation output and fuel requirements as the obligation to post margin increases with increasing prices and, resultingly, could require the maintenance of liquidity resources that would be prohibitively expensive.
Environmental regulations could limit operations
      PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings
      PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings are required to comply with numerous statutes, regulations and ordinances relating to the safety and health of employees and the public, the protection of the environment and land use. These statutes, regulations and ordinances are constantly changing. While management believes that PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings have obtained all material approvals currently required to own and operate their respective facilities and that approvals will be issued in a timely manner, significant additional costs could be incurred in order to comply with these requirements. In some cases, the cost of compliance could exceed the marginal value of the facility. Failure to comply with environmental statutes, regulations and ordinances could have a material effect on PSEG, PSE&G, Power
and Energy Holdings, including potential civil or criminal liability, the imposition of clean-up liens or fines and expenditures of funds to bring facilities into compliance or possible impairment of the value of the affected facility.
      PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings can give no assurance that they will be able to:


•
obtain all required environmental approvals not yet received or that may be required in the future;

 


•
obtain any necessary modifications to existing environmental approvals;

 


•
maintain compliance with all applicable environmental laws, regulations and approvals; or

 


•
recover any resulting costs through future sales.

      Delay in obtaining or failure to obtain and maintain in full force and effect any environmental approvals, or delay or failure to satisfy any applicable environmental regulatory requirements, could prevent construction of new facilities, operation of existing facilities or sale of energy from these facilities or could result in significant additional costs.
      Power
      Many of Power's generating facilities are located in the State of New Jersey where environmental programs are generally considered to be more stringent in comparison to similar programs in other states. As such, there may be instances where the facilities located in New Jersey are subject to more stringent and, therefore, more costly pollution control requirements than competitive facilities in other states.
Regulatory issues significantly impact operations
      PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings
      Federal, state and local authorities impose substantial regulation and permitting requirements on the electric power generation business. Power and Energy Holdings are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations and to obtain numerous governmental permits in order to operate generation stations. In
32



addition, PSE&G's and certain of Global's distribution facilities could be subject to financial penalties if reliability performance standards are not met.
      PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings can give no assurance that existing regulations will not be revised or reinterpreted, that new laws and regulations will not be adopted or become applicable or that future changes in laws and regulations, including the possibility of reregulation in some deregulated markets, will not have a detrimental effect on their respective businesses.
      Power and Energy Holdings
      Power and Energy Holdings believe that they have obtained all material energy-related federal, state and local approvals currently required to operate their respective generation stations and sell energy output, including MBR authority from FERC. Although not currently required, additional regulatory approvals may be required in the future due to changes in laws and regulations or for other reasons. No assurance can be given that Power and Energy Holdings will be able to obtain any required regulatory approval in the future, or that they will be able to obtain any necessary extensions in receiving any required regulatory approvals.
      Power is also subject to pervasive regulation by the NRC with respect to the operation of nuclear generation stations. This regulation involves testing, evaluation and modification of all aspects of plant operation in light of NRC safety, environmental and personnel management requirements. The NRC also requires continuous demonstrations that plant operations meet applicable requirements. The NRC has the ultimate authority to determine whether any nuclear generation unit may operate.
      Any failure to obtain or comply with any required regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect Power's and Energy Holdings' ability to operate generation stations or sell electricity to third parties.
Availability of adequate power transmission facilities
      PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings
      The ability to sell and deliver electric energy products may be adversely impacted and the ability to generate revenues may be limited if:


•
transmission is disrupted;

 


•
transmission capacity is inadequate; or

 


•
a region's power transmission infrastructure is inadequate.

Inability to access sufficient capital in the amounts and at the times needed
      PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings
      Capital for projects and investments has been provided by internally-generated cash flow, equity issuances by PSEG and borrowings by PSEG, PSE&G, Power, Energy Holdings and their respective subsidiaries. Continued access to debt capital from outside sources is required in order to efficiently fund the cash flow needs of the businesses. The ability to arrange financing and the costs of capital depend on numerous factors including, among other things, general economic and market conditions, the availability of credit from banks and other financial institutions, investor confidence, the success of current projects and the quality of new projects.
      The ability to access sufficient capital in the bank and debt capital markets is dependent upon current and future capital structure, performance, financial condition and the availability of capital at a reasonable economic cost. As a result, no assurance can be given that PSEG, PSE&G, Power or Energy Holdings will be successful in obtaining financing for projects and investments or funding the equity commitments required for such projects and investments in the future.
Counterparty credit risks or a deterioration of credit quality
      PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings
      As market prices for energy and fuel fluctuate, Power's forward energy sale and forward fuel purchase contracts could require substantial collateral requiring Power to source additional liquidity during periods when Power's ability to source such liquidity may be limited. Also, in connection with its energy trading
33



activities, Power must meet credit quality standards required by counterparties. Standard industry contracts generally require trading counterparties to maintain investment grade ratings. These same contracts provide reciprocal benefits to Power. If Power loses its investment grade credit rating, ER&T would have to provide additional collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash, which would significantly impact the energy trading business. This would increase Power's costs of doing business and limit its ability to successfully conduct energy trading operations.
      Power sells generation output through the execution of bilateral contracts. These contracts are subject to credit risk, which relates to the ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations. Any failure to collect these payments from counterparties could have a material impact on PSEG's and Power's results of operations, cash flows and financial position. As market prices rise above contracted price levels, Power is required to post collateral with purchasers. Collateral posting requirements for BGS contracts in particular are one-sided. If market prices fall below BGS contracted price levels for a single contract, power purchasers are not required to post collateral with Power. However, such margin positions can be netted against margin due from Power in other BGS contracts with the same
counterparty.
Substantial competition from well-capitalized participants in the worldwide energy markets
      PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings
      Restructuring of worldwide energy markets is creating opportunities for, and substantial competition from, well-capitalized entities that may adversely affect the ability of PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings to make investments on favorable terms and achieve growth objectives. Increased competition could contribute to a reduction in prices offered for power and could result in lower returns which may affect PSEG's, PSE&G's, Power's and Energy Holdings' ability to service their respective outstanding indebtedness, including short-term debt. Some of the competitors include:


•
merchant generators;

 


•
banks, funds and other financial entities;

 


•
domestic and multi-national utility generators;

 


•
energy marketers;

 


•
fuel supply companies; and

 


•
affiliates of other industrial companies.

As a holding company, the ability to service debt could be limited
      PSEG and Energy Holdings
      PSEG and Energy Holdings are holding companies with no material assets other than the stock or membership interests of their subsidiaries and project affiliates. As such, PSEG and Energy Holdings depend on their respective subsidiaries' and project affiliates' cash flow and their respective access to capital in order to service their indebtedness. Each of PSEG's and Energy Holdings' respective subsidiaries and project affiliates are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts when due on PSEG's or Energy Holdings' debt or to make any funds available to pay such amounts. As a result, PSEG's and Energy Holdings' debt will effectively be subordinated to all existing and future debt, trade creditors, and other liabilities of their
respective subsidiaries and project affiliates and PSEG's and Energy Holdings' rights and hence the rights of their respective creditors to participate in any distribution of assets of any subsidiary or project affiliate upon its liquidation or reorganization or otherwise would be subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary's or project affiliate's creditors, except to the extent that PSEG's or Energy Holdings' claims as a creditor of such subsidiary or project affiliate may be recognized.
      In addition, Energy Holdings' subsidiaries' project-related debt agreements generally restrict the subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends, make cash distributions or otherwise transfer funds. These restrictions may include achieving and maintaining financial performance or debt coverage ratios, absence of events of default, or priority in payment of other current or prospective obligations. These restrictions could further restrict Energy Holdings' ability to service its outstanding indebtedness.
34



Adverse international developments could negatively impact results
      Energy Holdings
      A component of PSEG's and Energy Holdings business strategy has been the development, acquisition and operation of projects outside the U.S. The economic and political conditions in certain countries where Global has interests present risks that may be different than those found in the U.S. which could affect the value of its investments cash flows from projects and make it more difficult to obtain non-recourse project refinancing on suitable terms or could impair Global's ability to enforce its rights under agreements relating to such projects. Such risks include:


•
expropriation or nationalization of energy assets;

 


•
renegotiation or abrogation of existing contracts; and

 


•
changes in law or tax policy.

      Operations in foreign countries also present risks associated with currency exchange and convertibility, inflation and repatriation of earnings. In some countries, economic and monetary conditions and other factors could affect Global's ability to convert its cash distributions to U.S. Dollars or other freely convertible currencies, or to move funds offshore from these countries. Furthermore, the central bank of any of these countries may have the authority to suspend, restrict or otherwise impose conditions on foreign exchange transactions or to approve distributions to foreign investors.
Inability to realize tax benefits
      Energy Holdings
      Through its leveraged lease investments, Resources acquires an asset by obtaining equity representing approximately 15% to 20% of the cost of the asset and incurring non-recourse lease debt for the balance. As the owner, Resources is entitled to depreciate the asset under applicable federal and state tax guidelines and receives income from the tax benefits associated with interest and depreciation deductions with respect to the leased property. The ability of Resources to realize these tax benefits is dependent on operating income generated by its affiliates and allocated pursuant to PSEG's consolidated tax sharing agreement. A reduction of operating income could impair Resources' ability to receive such benefits, which would result in a reduction of earnings and cash flows. In addition, during 2005, the IRS proposed
to disallow certain deductions associated with some of the leveraged leases which have been designated by the IRS as listed transactions. Any material disallowance of deductions could impact Energy Holdings' earnings and ability to service its outstanding indebtedness.
Failure to consummate the proposed Merger with Exelon
      PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings
      The proposed Merger with Exelon is subject to regulatory reviews not yet concluded, including the BPU and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). The required regulatory approvals might not be received by June 20, 2006, the date set after which either PSEG or Exelon could terminate the Merger Agreement. Any regulatory approvals could contain one or more conditions which either PSEG or Exelon could determine constitute a “burdensome order” under the Merger Agreement giving each the right to terminate.
      If the Merger is not closed, PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings could experience one or more of the following consequences:


•
a credit rating downgrade by one or more of the credit rating agencies, resulting in higher financing costs and potentially limiting capital and credit market access;

 


•
an inability to implement successful succession planning, attract and retain management and key employees and replace personnel lost to attrition pending regulatory approval of the Merger; and

 


•
an inability to continue improved nuclear performance over a longer-term horizon.

35



Decreases in the value of the pension and other postretirement assets could require additional funding
      PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings
      Adverse changes in the rates of return or performance of the investments in which the pension and other postretirement trust assets are held could lower the value of the funds and the trust assets. Such a decline in value could result in additional funding obligations to meet the applicable legal and regulatory requirements. To the extent that these additional funding obligations are significant, this could impact PSEG's, PSE&G's, Power's and Energy Holdings' ability to service debt.
Changes in technology may make power generation assets less competitive
      Power and Energy Holdings
      A key element of the business plan is that generating power at central power plants produces electricity at relatively low cost. There are alternative technologies to produce electricity that continue to attract capital for research and development, most notably fuel cells, microturbines, windmills and photovoltaic (solar) cells. It is possible that advances in technology will reduce the cost of alternative methods of producing electricity to a level that is competitive with that of most central station electric production. If this were to happen, Power's and Energy Holdings' market share could be eroded and the value of their respective power plants could be significantly impaired. Changes in technology could also alter the channels through which retail electric customers buy electricity, which could affect financial
results.
Insurance coverages may not be sufficient
      PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings
      PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings have insurance for their respective facilities, including:


•
all-risk property damage insurance;

 


•
commercial general public liability insurance;

 


•
boiler and machinery coverage;

 


•
nuclear liability; and

 


•
for nuclear generating units, replacement power and business interruption insurance in amounts and with deductibles that management considers appropriate.

      PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings can give no assurance that this insurance coverage will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms or that the insurance proceeds received for any loss of or any damage to any of their respective facilities will be sufficient to fund future payments on debt. Additionally, some properties may not be insured in the event of an act of terrorism.
Recession, acts of war or terrorism
      PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings
      The consequences of a prolonged recession and adverse market conditions may include the continued uncertainty of energy prices and the capital and commodity markets. Management cannot predict the impact of any continued economic slowdown, reduced growth rate in energy usage or fluctuating energy prices; however, such impact could have a material adverse effect on PSEG's, PSE&G's, Power's and Energy Holdings' financial condition, results of operations and net cash flows.
      Major industrial facilities, generation plants, fuel storage facilities and transmission and distribution facilities may be targets of terrorist activities that could result in disruption of PSE&G's, Power's or Energy Holdings' ability to produce or distribute some portion of their respective energy products. Any such disruption could result in a significant decrease in revenues and/or significant additional costs to repair, which could have a material adverse impact on the financial condition, results of operation and net cash flows of PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings.
