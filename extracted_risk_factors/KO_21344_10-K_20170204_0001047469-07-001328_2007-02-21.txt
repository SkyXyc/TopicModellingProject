Item 1A. Risk Factors" in Part I of this report for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company. 


Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

        Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, which require management to
make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We believe that our most critical accounting policies and
estimates relate to the following: 



•Basis
of Presentation and Consolidation
•Recoverability
of Noncurrent Assets
•Revenue
Recognition
•Income
Taxes
•Contingencies



        Management
has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. While our
estimates and assumptions are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions. For a
discussion of the Company's significant accounting policies, refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 



 Basis of Presentation and Consolidation  



        In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Interpretation No. 46(R). We adopted Interpretation No. 46(R)
effective April 2, 2004. Refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 


        Our
Company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest as well as variable interest entities for which our Company is the primary beneficiary.
Our judgment in determining if we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entities includes assessing our Company's level of involvement in setting up the entity, determining if the
activities of the entity are substantially conducted on 

35




 


behalf
of our Company, determining whether the Company provides more than half of the subordinated financial support to the entity, and determining if we absorb the majority of the entity's expected
losses or returns. 

        We
use the equity method to account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies. Our consolidated net income
includes our Company's share of the net earnings of these companies. Our judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as our
ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intercompany transactions. 


        We
use the cost method to account for investments in companies that we do not control and for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and
financial policies. In accordance with the cost method, these investments are recorded at cost or fair value, as appropriate. We record dividend income when applicable dividends are declared. 

        Our
Company eliminates from financial results all significant intercompany transactions, including the intercompany portion of transactions with equity method investees. 



 Recoverability of Noncurrent Assets  



        Management's assessments of the recoverability of noncurrent assets involve critical accounting estimates. These assessments reflect management's best
assumptions, which, when appropriate, are consistent with the assumptions that we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use. Factors that management must estimate when performing
recoverability and impairment tests include, among others, sales volume, prices, inflation, cost of capital, marketing spending, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates and capital spending. These
factors are often interdependent and therefore do not change in isolation. These factors include inherent uncertainties, and significant management judgment is involved in estimating their impact.
However, when appropriate, the assumptions we use for financial reporting purposes are consistent with those we use in our internal planning and we believe are consistent with those that a
hypothetical marketplace participant would use. Management periodically evaluates and updates the estimates based on the conditions that influence these factors. The variability of these factors
depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. If other assumptions and estimates had been used in
the current period, the balances for noncurrent assets could have been materially impacted. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future periods,
future operating results could be materially impacted. 

        Our
Company faces many uncertainties and risks related to various economic, political and regulatory environments in the countries in which we operate. Refer to the heading "Our
Business—Challenges and Risks," above, and "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in Part I of this report. As a result, management must make numerous assumptions which involve a
significant amount of judgment when determining the recoverability of noncurrent assets in various regions around the world. 

        For
the noncurrent assets listed in the table below, we perform tests of impairment as appropriate. For applicable assets, we perform these tests when certain conditions exist that
indicate the carrying value may not 

36




 


be
recoverable. For other applicable assets, we perform these tests at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired:

        Many of the noncurrent assets listed above are located in markets that we consider to be developing or to have changing political environments.
These markets include, but are not limited to, the Middle East and Egypt, where political and civil unrest continues; the Philippines, where affordability and availability of beverages in the
marketplace continue to impact operating results; India, where affordability issues remain; and certain markets in Latin America, Asia and Africa, where local economic and political conditions are
unstable. We have bottling assets and investments in many of these markets. The table below reflects the Company's carrying value of noncurrent assets in these markets.

 Equity Method and Cost Method Investments  



        We review our equity and cost method investments in every reporting period to determine whether a significant event or change in circumstances has occurred that
may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment. When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to the carrying value of the related investment. We also perform
this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which the carrying value has exceeded the fair value in the prior period. The fair values of most of our Company's investments in
publicly traded companies are often readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded companies, management's assessment of fair value is based on valuation
methodologies including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds and external appraisals, as appropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe hypothetical marketplace participants
would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or estimate of sales proceeds valuation methodologies. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows,
especially in developing and unstable markets, may impact the determination of fair value. 


        In
the event a decline in fair value of an investment occurs, management may be required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. Management's assessment as to
the nature of a decline in fair value is based on the valuation methodologies discussed above, our ability and intent to hold the investment, and whether evidence indicating the cost of the investment
is recoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs evidence to the contrary. We consider most of our equity method investees to be strategic long-term investments. If the fair
value of an investment is less than its carrying value and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary, a write-down is recorded. Management's assessments of fair value
represent our best estimates as of the time of the impairment review and are consistent with the assumptions that we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use. If different assessments
were made, this could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

        The
following table presents the difference between calculated fair values, based on quoted closing prices of publicly traded shares, and our Company's carrying values for significant
investments in publicly traded bottlers accounted for as equity method investees (in millions):

In 2006, our carrying value of CCE was reduced by our proportionate share of an impairment charge recorded by CCE. Refer to Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.






 Other Assets  



        Our Company invests in infrastructure programs with our bottlers that are directed at strengthening our bottling system and increasing unit case volume.
Additionally, our Company advances payments to certain customers to fund future marketing activities intended to generate profitable volume and expenses such payments over the periods benefited.
Advance payments are also made to certain customers for distribution rights. Payments under these programs are generally capitalized and reported as other assets in our consolidated 

38




 

balance
sheets. Management evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of these assets when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable by
preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows. If the carrying value of these assets is assessed to be recoverable, it is amortized over the periods benefited. If
the carrying value of these assets is considered to be not recoverable, an impairment is recognized, resulting in a write-down of assets. 



 Property, Plant and Equipment  



        Certain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment should be assessed. Such
events or changes may include a significant decrease in market value, a significant change in the business climate in a particular market, or a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with
historical losses or projected future losses. If an event occurs or changes in circumstances are present, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its
eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment loss. The impairment loss
recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. 



 Goodwill, Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets  



        Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," classifies intangible assets into three categories:
(1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill. For intangible assets
with definite lives, tests for impairment must be performed if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill, tests
for impairment must be performed at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. Our equity method investees also perform such tests for
impairment for intangible assets and/or goodwill. If an impairment charge was recorded by one of our equity method investees, the Company would record its proportionate share of such charge. 

        In
2006, our Company recorded a charge of approximately $602 million in the line item equity income—net resulting from the impact of our proportionate share of an
impairment charge recorded by CCE, which impacted Bottling Investments. Refer to the heading "Operations Review—Equity Income—Net" and Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements. 

        Our
trademarks and other intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, if conditions exist that
indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable, we review such trademarks and other intangible assets with definite lives for impairment to ensure they are appropriately valued. Such conditions
may include an economic downturn in a market or a change in the assessment of future operations. Trademarks and other intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized. We
test such trademarks and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. Goodwill is
not amortized. We also perform tests for impairment of goodwill annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it might be impaired. All goodwill is assigned to reporting units,
which are one level below our operating segments. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that benefits from the synergies arising from each business combination. We perform our impairment tests of
goodwill at our reporting unit level. Impairment tests for goodwill include comparing the fair value of the respective reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. We use a variety of
methodologies in conducting these impairment assessments, including cash flow analyses that, when appropriate, are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants
would use, estimates of sales proceeds and independent appraisals. Where applicable, we use an appropriate discount rate based on the Company's cost of capital rate or location-specific economic
factors. 

39




 


        In
2006, our Company recorded impairment charges of approximately $41 million primarily related to trademarks for beverages sold in the Philippines and Indonesia. The Philippines
and Indonesia are
components of East, South Asia and Pacific Rim. The amount of these impairment charges was determined by comparing the fair values of the intangible assets to their respective carrying values. The
fair values were determined using discounted cash flow analyses. Because the fair values were less than the carrying values of the assets, we recorded impairment charges to reduce the carrying values
of the assets to their respective fair values. These impairment charges were recorded in the line item other operating charges in the consolidated statement of income. 

        In
December 2006, the Company entered into a purchase agreement with San Miguel Corporation and two of its subsidiaries (collectively, "SMC") to acquire all of the shares of
capital stock of Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc. ("CCBPI") held by SMC, representing 65 percent of all the issued and outstanding capital stock of CCBPI. CCBPI is the
Company's authorized bottler in the Philippines. The transaction is subject to certain conditions. Upon the closing of this transaction, the Company will own 100 percent of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of CCBPI. Management will continue to monitor the Philippines and conduct impairment reviews as required. 

        In
2005, our Company recorded impairment charges of approximately $84 million related to intangible assets. These intangible assets related to trademarks for beverages sold in the
Philippines. The carrying value of our trademarks in the Philippines, prior to the recording of the impairment charges in 2005, was approximately $268 million. The impairments were the result
of our revised outlook for the Philippines, which had been unfavorably impacted by declines in volume and income before income taxes resulting from the continued lack of an affordable package offering
and the continued limited availability of these trademark beverages in the marketplace. We determined the amounts of the impairment charges by comparing the fair values of the intangible assets to
their then carrying values. Fair values were derived using discounted cash flow analyses with a number of scenarios that were weighted based on the probability of different outcomes. Because the fair
values were less than the carrying values of the assets, we recorded impairment charges to reduce the carrying values of the assets to fair values. In addition, in 2005, we recorded an impairment
charge of approximately $4 million in the line item equity income—net related to our proportionate share of a write-down of intangible assets recorded by our equity
method investee bottler in the Philippines. 

        In
2004, our Company recorded impairment charges related to intangible assets of approximately $374 million, primarily related to franchise rights at CCEAG. CCEAG is a component
of Bottling Investments. The CCEAG impairment charges were the result of our revised outlook for the German market, which was unfavorably impacted by volume declines resulting from market shifts
related to the deposit law on nonrefillable beverage packages and the corresponding lack of availability of our products in the discount retail channel. The deposit law in Germany had led to discount
chains creating proprietary nonrefillable packages that could only be returned to their own stores. We determined the amount of the impairment by comparing the fair value of the intangible assets to
its then carrying value. Fair values were derived using discounted cash flow analyses with a number of scenarios that were weighted based on the probability of different outcomes. Because the fair
value was less than the carrying value of the assets, we recorded an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the assets to fair value. These impairment charges were recorded in the line item
other operating charges in our consolidated statement of income for 2004. At the end of 2004, the German government passed an amendment to the mandatory deposit legislation that requires retailers,
including discount chains, to accept returns of each type of nonrefillable beverage package they sell, regardless of where the beverage package type was purchased. In addition, the mandatory deposit
requirement was expanded to other beverage categories. 

        In
August 2006, the Company announced that it had reached an agreement in principle with its independent bottlers in Germany regarding the creation of a single bottler. A
non-binding letter of intent was signed containing the financial framework and the key conditions under which CCEAG and the seven independent bottlers will become one bottler. We currently
expect that this consolidation will occur in 2007. The Company will be the majority owner of the consolidated bottling operation in Germany. The Company has 

40




 

considered
and will continue to consider the effect of these future structural changes on the recoverability of noncurrent assets and investments in bottling operations in Germany. 



 Revenue Recognition  



        We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of products has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and
collectibility is reasonably assured. For our Company, this generally means that we recognize revenue when title to our products is transferred to our bottling partners, resellers or other customers.
In particular, title usually transfers upon shipment to or receipt at our customers' locations, as determined by the specific sales terms of each transaction. 

        In
addition, our customers can earn certain incentives, which are included in deductions from revenue, a component of net operating revenues in the consolidated statements of income.
These incentives include, but are not limited to, cash discounts, funds for promotional and marketing activities, volume-based incentive programs and support for infrastructure programs. Refer to
Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The aggregate deductions from revenue recorded by the Company in relation to these programs, including amortization expense on
infrastructure programs, was approximately $3.8 billion, $3.7 billion and $3.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 



 Income Taxes  



        In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" ("Interpretation No. 48").
Interpretation No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, "Accounting
for Income Taxes." Interpretation No. 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected
to be taken in a tax return. Interpretation No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties,
accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. For our Company, Interpretation No. 48 was effective beginning January 1, 2007, and the cumulative effect adjustment will be
recorded in the first quarter of 2007. We believe that the adoption of Interpretation No. 48 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

        Our
annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is
required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves at the time we determine it is probable we will be liable to pay additional taxes related to
certain matters. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. 

        A
number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending
on the tax jurisdiction. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we record a reserve when we determine the likelihood of loss
is probable. Such liabilities are recorded in the line item accrued income taxes in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash.
Favorable resolutions of tax matters for which we have previously established reserves are recognized as a reduction to our income tax expense when the amounts involved become known. 

        Tax
law requires items to be included in the tax return at different times than when these items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements. As a result, the annual tax rate
reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our tax return (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not
deductible in our tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax 

41




 


bases
of assets and liabilities. The tax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities are the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
Based on the evaluation of all available information, the Company recognizes future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered
more likely than not. 

        We
evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating
results, the reversal of existing temporary differences, taxable income in prior carryback years (if permitted) and the availability of tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is required to be
established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that the Company will ultimately realize the tax benefit associated with a deferred tax asset. 


        Additionally,
undistributed earnings of a subsidiary are accounted for as a temporary difference, except that deferred tax liabilities are not recorded for undistributed earnings of a
foreign subsidiary that are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested in the foreign jurisdiction. The Company has formulated a specific plan for reinvestment of undistributed earnings of its foreign
subsidiaries which demonstrates that such earnings will be indefinitely reinvested in the applicable tax jurisdictions. Should we change our plans, we would be required to record a significant amount
of deferred tax liabilities. 

        The
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "Jobs Creation Act") was enacted in October 2004. Among other things, it provided a one-time benefit related to foreign tax
credits generated by equity investments in prior years. In 2004, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $50 million as a result of this new law. The Jobs Creation Act also
included a temporary incentive for U.S. multinationals to repatriate foreign earnings at an approximate 5.25 percent effective tax rate. During 2005, the Company repatriated approximately
$6.1 billion in previously unremitted foreign earnings, with an associated tax liability of approximately $315 million. The reinvestment requirements of this repatriation are expected to
be fulfilled by 2008 and are not expected to require any material change in the nature, amount or timing of future expenditures from what was otherwise expected. Refer to Note 1 and
Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

        The
Company's effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23 percent in 2007. This estimated tax rate does not reflect the impact of any unusual or special items that may
affect our tax rate in 2007. 



 Contingencies  



        Our Company is subject to various claims and contingencies, mostly related to legal proceedings. Due to their nature, such legal proceedings involve inherent
uncertainties including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties and governmental actions. Management assesses the probability of loss for such contingencies and
accrues a liability and/or discloses the relevant circumstances, as appropriate. Management believes that any liability to the Company that may arise as a result of currently pending legal proceedings
or other contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company taken as a whole. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 



 Recent Accounting Standards and Pronouncements  



        Refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting standards and pronouncements. 

Operations Review  

        We manufacture, distribute and market nonalcoholic beverage concentrates and syrups. We also manufacture, distribute and market some finished beverages. Our
organizational structure as of December 31, 2006 consisted of the following operating segments, the first seven of which are sometimes referred to as "operating groups" or "groups": Africa;
East, South Asia and Pacific Rim; European Union; Latin America; North America; North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East; Bottling Investments; and Corporate. For further information regarding our
operating segments, including a discussion of changes made to our operating segments during 2006, refer to Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

<A
NAME="page_dq3053_1_43">  



 Volume  



        We measure our sales volume in two ways: (1) unit cases of finished products and (2) gallons. A "unit case" is a unit of measurement equal to 192
U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings). Unit case volume represents the number of unit cases of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its
bottling partners ("Coca-Cola system") to consumers. Unit case volume primarily consists of beverage products bearing Company trademarks. Also included in unit case volume are certain
products licensed to, or distributed by, our Company, and brands owned by Coca-Cola system bottlers for which our Company provides marketing support and from the sale of which it derives
income. Such products licensed to, or distributed by, our Company or owned by Coca-Cola system bottlers account for a minimal portion of total unit case volume. In addition, unit case
volume includes sales by joint ventures in which the Company is a partner. Unit case volume is derived based on estimates supplied by our bottling partners and distributors. A "gallon" is a unit of
measurement for concentrates, syrups, beverage bases, finished beverages and powders (in all cases expressed in equivalent gallons of syrup) sold by the Company to its bottling partners or other
customers. Most of our revenues are based on gallon sales, a primarily wholesale activity, as discussed under "Item 1. Business" in Part I of this report and the heading "Net Operating
Revenues," below. Unit case volume and gallon sales growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period. Items such as seasonality, bottlers' inventory practices, supply point changes,
timing of price increases and new product introductions and changes in product mix can impact unit case volume and gallon sales and can create differences between unit case volume and gallon sales
growth rates.

 Unit Case Volume  



        Although most of our Company's revenues are not based directly on unit case volume, we believe unit case volume is one of the measures of the underlying strength
of the Coca-Cola system because it measures our product trends at the consumer level. The Coca-Cola system sold approximately 21.4 billion unit cases of our products in
2006, approximately 20.6 billion unit cases in 2005, and approximately 19.8 billion unit cases in 2004. 


        In
Africa, unit case volume increased 4 percent in 2006 compared to 2005, reflecting growth across the majority of divisions, which was partially offset by a slight decline in
Nigeria primarily related to affordability issues and competitive and economic pressure. The unit case volume increase in Africa was also partially offset 

43




 


by
an industrywide temporary shortage in the supply of carbon dioxide in South Africa in the fourth quarter of 2006. 


        Unit
case volume in East, South Asia and Pacific Rim decreased 5 percent in 2006 versus 2005, primarily due to a double-digit decline in the Philippines, which was mainly driven
by the continued impact of affordability and availability issues. In December 2006, the Company and SMC entered into an agreement for the Company to acquire, subject to the fulfillment of
certain conditions, the 65 percent ownership interest in CCBPI held by SMC. Upon the closing of the acquisition, the Company will own 100 percent of the issued and outstanding capital
stock of CCBPI. The transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of 2007. The Company expects performance in the Philippines to remain weak during 2007. Performance in this operating
segment was also impacted by a 5 percent decline in India primarily due to price increases in the second half of 2005 and steps taken to drive revenue growth and improve operating and working
capital efficiency. The results in India reflected high single-digit declines in sparkling beverages which was partially offset by growth in still beverages. Continued investment in marketing
initiatives around the quality and safety of our products and focus on execution in the consolidated bottling operations delivered positive results during the second half of 2006, despite the renewed
unfounded allegations of unsafe pesticide levels in the Company's products. 

        Unit
case volume in the European Union increased 6 percent in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to solid growth across all divisions driven by successful marketing campaigns,
launches of Coca-Cola Zero in nine countries and favorable weather in the second half of 2006. In addition, the acquisition of Apollinaris GmbH, a German premium source water brand
("Apollinaris"), and the joint acquisition of Fonti del Vulture S.r.l., also known as Traficante, an Italian mineral water company, with Coca-Cola HBC during 2006 contributed approximately
2 percentage points of unit case volume growth in 2006. Unit case volume in Germany increased 5 percent in 2006 versus 2005, and reflected strong growth of Trademark Coca-Cola in
2006 compared to 2005. The results were driven by improved marketplace execution capabilities, the launch of Coca-Cola Zero in July 2006, increased availability in the discounter
channel and generally favorable weather. As mentioned above, the acquisition of Apollinaris also contributed to unit case volume growth in Germany. The Company expects stabilizing trends in Germany to
continue during 2007. Unit case volume in Northwest Europe increased 3 percent in 2006 versus 2005 as performance stabilized. The results reflected 3 percent unit case volume growth in
sparkling beverages, led by growth of Trademark Coca-Cola, and solid growth in still beverages. In addition, the successful launch of Coca-Cola Zero in Great Britain at the end
of June 2006 and generally favorable weather during the second half of the year contributed to the performance. Unit case volume in Iberia increased 6 percent in 2006 versus 2005, led by
strong growth in Spain. 

        In
Latin America, unit case volume increased 7 percent in 2006 versus 2005, primarily due to growth in sparkling beverages led by growth of Trademark Coca-Cola. This
performance was seen in all key markets, especially Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. In Mexico, the increase in unit case volume was driven by strong growth in Trademark Coca-Cola. In Brazil,
strong marketing and bottler execution led to unit case volume growth in sparkling beverages. In Argentina, consumer marketing activities and bottler execution drove unit case volume growth.
Additionally, in December 2006, the Company and Coca-Cola FEMSA entered into an agreement to jointly acquire Jugos del Valle, S.A.B. de C.V., the second largest producer of packaged
juices, nectars and fruit-flavored beverages in Mexico and the largest producer of such products in Brazil. 

        Unit
case volume in North America was even in 2006 versus 2005. Foodservice and Hospitality unit case volume increased 1 percent in 2006, reflecting growth in all key beverage
categories. Unit case volume in Retail decreased 1 percent primarily driven by weak sparkling beverage trends in the second half of 2006, declines in the warehouse-delivered water business
resulting from the strategic decision to refocus resources behind the more profitable Dasani business and declines in the warehouse-delivered juice business as a result of price increases to cover
higher ingredient costs. These declines in Retail were partially offset by the continued success of Dasani, Coca-Cola Zero and Powerade, as well as the introduction of Black Cherry Vanilla
Coca-Cola and the national rollout of Vault. In February 2007, our Company entered into an agreement to purchase Fuze 

44




 


Beverage,
LLC, maker of Fuze enhanced juices, teas, waters and energy drinks. The Company expects performance in North America to be weak during 2007. 

        In
North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East, unit case volume grew 11 percent in 2006 compared to 2005, led by double-digit growth in China, Russia and Turkey, partially offset by a
3 percent decline in Japan. The increase in unit case volume in China was led by significant growth in both sparkling and still beverages. The unit case volume growth in Russia and Turkey was
the result of improving macroeconomic trends, strong bottler execution and successful marketing programs. Unit case volume in Russia also benefited from the full-year impact of the joint
acquisition of Multon, compared to a partial year in 2005. The Company and Coca-Cola HBC jointly acquired Multon, a Russian juice company, in April 2005. The decrease in unit case volume
in Japan was primarily due to weakness across core brands including Trademark Coca-Cola, Georgia Coffee and our green tea brands. However, results in Japan gradually improved during 2006
and position Japan for growth in 2007. 

        Unit
case volume for Bottling Investments increased 16 percent in 2006 versus 2005, primarily due to the acquisition of Kerry Beverages Limited, which was subsequently renamed
Coca-Cola China Industries Limited ("CCCIL"), and the acquisitions of TJC Holdings (Pty) Ltd., a South African bottling company ("TJC"), and Apollinaris. The Company
intends to sell a portion of its investment in TJC to Black Economic Empowerment entities at a future date. Unit case volume for Bottling Investments also increased due to the consolidation of
Brucephil, Inc. ("Brucephil"), the parent company of The Philadelphia Coca-Cola Bottling Company. In the third quarter of 2006, our Company signed agreements with J. Bruce Llewellyn
and Brucephil for the potential purchase of the remaining shares of Brucephil not currently owned by the Company. The agreements provide for the Company's purchase of the shares upon
the election of Mr. Llewellyn or the election of the Company. Based on the terms of these agreements, the Company concluded that it must consolidate Brucephil under Interpretation
No. 46(R). Brucephil's financial statements were consolidated effective September 29, 2006. The acquisition of the German bottling company Bremer Erfrischungsgetraenke GmbH ("Bremer")
during the third quarter of 2005 also contributed to unit case volume increases in 2006, reflecting the impact of full-year unit case volume in 2006 for Bremer compared to a partial year
in 2005. The unit case volume increase was partially offset by a decline in India. 

        In
Africa, unit case volume increased 6 percent in 2005 compared to 2004. This increase was driven by growth in core sparkling beverages as well as still beverages across all
divisions in this operating segment. 

        In
East, South Asia and Pacific Rim, unit case volume decreased 4 percent in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily due to declines in India and the Philippines. The decline in India
was related to the impact of price increases to cover rising raw material and distribution costs and the lingering effects of the 2003 pesticide allegations. The decline in the Philippines was
primarily related to affordability and availability issues. 

        Unit
case volume in the European Union was even in 2005 versus 2004, primarily due to strong growth in Spain and Central Europe partially offset by declines primarily in Germany and
Northwest Europe. Unit case volume in Germany declined 2 percent in 2005 due to the continued impact of the mandatory deposit legislation on the availability of nonrefillable packages and the
corresponding limited availability of our products in the discount retail channel, along with overall industry weakness. In the second half of 2005, the Company achieved availability of a limited
range of its products in most discounters. Results in Germany stabilized in the second half of 2005. Unit case volume in Northwest Europe declined 3 percent in 2005, primarily due to the soft
economic environment and declines in sparkling beverages, which was associated with a decrease in competitors' prices at retailers, and the discount channel becoming a larger part of the retail
market, together with a shift in consumer preferences away from regular sparkling beverages driven by health and wellness trends and the associated public opinion, media and government attention. 

        Unit
case volume for Latin America increased 6 percent in 2005 versus 2004, reflecting strong growth in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, primarily due to growth in sparkling
beverages. The increase in Brazil and Mexico was primarily due to strong marketing, execution and package innovation. 

45




 


        In
North America, unit case volume in Retail increased 2 percent in 2005 versus 2004, reflecting improved performance in the bottler-delivered business primarily related to
Dasani, Coca-Cola Zero and still beverages, along with growth in the warehouse juice and warehouse water operations. Foodservice and Hospitality had a 1 percent increase in 2005
compared to 2004, reflecting improved trends in restaurant
traffic and the impact of a new customer conversion partially offset by the impact of higher fuel costs and Hurricane Katrina on consumer restaurant spending. 

        In
North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East, unit case volume grew 15 percent in 2005 versus 2004, led by 22 percent growth in China, 2 percent growth in Japan,
54 percent growth in Russia and 14 percent growth in Turkey. The increase in unit case volume in China was led by significant growth in both sparkling and still beverages. Japan's growth
was primarily due to new product introductions. The unit case volume growth in Turkey was largely due to improving macroeconomic trends, strong bottler execution and successful marketing programs. The
unit case volume growth in Russia was the result of the joint acquisition of Multon as well as improving macroeconomic trends, strong bottler execution and successful marketing programs. 

        Unit
case volume for Bottling Investments increased 6 percent in 2005 versus 2004, primarily related to the acquisitions and full-year impact of consolidation of certain bottling
operations under Interpretation No. 46(R). The unit case volume increase in 2005 was partially offset by a decline in India bottling operations and dispositions of certain bottling operations. 



 Gallon Sales  



        Company-wide gallon sales and unit case volume both grew 4 percent in 2006 when compared to 2005. In Africa, the gallon sales increase was
lower than the unit case volume increase mostly due to planned inventory reductions in Nigeria. In East, South Asia and Pacific Rim, the gallon sales decline was lower than the unit case volume
decline due to demand for Coca-Cola Zero in Australia and timing of gallon sales in India. In the European Union, unit case volume increased ahead of gallon sales volume due to timing of
gallon sales. Both in Latin America and North America, gallon sales and unit case volume were approximately equal. In North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East, unit case volume increased ahead of gallon
sales primarily due to inventory reductions in Russia. Unit case volume growth also reflected the impact of a full-year of unit case volume compared to a partial year in 2005 due to the
joint acquisition of Multon with Coca-Cola HBC in the second quarter of 2005. The Company only reports unit case volume related to Multon, as the Company does not sell concentrates or
syrups to Multon. 

        Company-wide
gallon sales grew 3 percent while unit case volume grew 4 percent in 2005 compared to 2004. In Africa, gallon sales growth of 7 percent
exceeded unit case volume growth of 6 percent in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily due to timing of gallon shipments. In East, South Asia and Pacific Rim, the gallon sales decline was higher
than the unit case volume decline primarily due to timing of gallon sales in India and the impact of 2005 planned inventory reductions in Australia. Both in the European Union and in Latin America,
gallon sales growth and unit case volume growth were even in 2005 versus 2004. In North America, gallon sales increased 1 percent while unit case volume increased 2 percent, primarily
due to the impact of higher gallon sales in 2004 related to the launch of Coca-Cola C2 and a change in shipping routes in 2004. In North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East, unit case volume
increased ahead of gallon sales volume due to the joint acquisition of Multon, which contributed to unit case volume in 2005, along
with timing of 2004 gallon sales, which impacted most of the remaining divisions in the operating segment. Multon had full-year unit case volume of approximately 80 million unit cases in 2004.

        Refer to the heading "Volume" for a detailed discussion on gallon sales. 

        "Structural
changes" refers to acquisitions or dispositions of bottling or canning operations and consolidation or deconsolidation of bottling entities for accounting purposes. In 2006,
structural changes decreased net
operating revenues by 2 percent compared to 2005, primarily due to the change of the business model in Spain, partially offset by the acquisitions of Bremer in the third quarter of 2005, TJC in
the first quarter of 2006, CCCIL in the third quarter of 2006 and the consolidation of Brucephil under Interpretation No. 46(R) effective September 29, 2006. Refer to Note 19 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company granted our bottling partners in Spain the rights to manufacture and distribute Company trademarked products
in can packages. Prior to granting these rights to our bottling partners, the Company held the manufacturing and distribution rights for these can packages in Spain. In connection with granting these
rights, the Company reduced our planned future annual marketing support payments to our bottling partners in Spain. These changes resulted in a reduction of net operating revenues and cost of goods
sold. This change did not materially impact gross profit for 2006. If the change had occurred as of January 1, 2005, net operating revenues for 2005 would have been reduced by approximately
$779 million. 

        Price
and product/geographic mix increased net operating revenues by 2 percent in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to price increases across the majority of the operating
segments and improved pricing and product/package mix in Bottling Investments partially offset by unfavorable product mix primarily in Japan. 

        In
2005, structural changes reflect the impact of a full year of revenue in 2005 for variable interest entities compared to a partial year in 2004. Under Interpretation No. 46(R),
the results of operations of variable interest entities in which the Company was determined to be the primary beneficiary were included in our consolidated results beginning April 2, 2004.
Refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The acquisition of Bremer during the third quarter of 2005 also favorably impacted net operating revenues. Refer to Note 19
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These increases in net operating revenues were offset by the dispositions of certain bottling and canning operations which were not material individually
or in aggregate. 

        The
favorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations in 2005 versus 2004 resulted from the strength of most key foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar, especially a stronger euro,
which favorably impacted the European Union and Bottling Investments, and a stronger Brazilian real and Mexican peso, that favorably impacted Latin America and Bottling Investments. The favorable
impact of fluctuation in these currencies was partially offset by a weaker Japanese yen, which unfavorably impacted North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East. Refer to the heading "Liquidity, Capital
Resources and Financial Position—Foreign Exchange." 

        Price
and product/geographic mix increased net operating revenues by 1 percent in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily due to price increases across the majority of the operating
segments and improved product/package mix in Bottling Investments, partially offset by unfavorable country mix.

        The percentage contribution of each operating segment has changed due to net operating revenues in certain segments growing at a faster rate
compared to the other operating segments, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations; and the acquisitions of CCCIL and TJC, and the consolidation of Brucephil under Interpretation No. 46(R),
which impacted Bottling Investments. The acquisition of Bremer during the third quarter of 2005 also increased net operating revenues in 2006, reflecting the impact of full-year net
operating revenues in 2006 for Bremer compared to a partial year in 2005. 

        The
size and timing of structural changes, including acquisitions or dispositions of bottling and canning operations, do not occur consistently from period to period. As a result,
anticipating the impact of such events on future increases or decreases in net operating revenues (and other financial statement line items) usually is not possible. However, we expect to continue to
buy and sell bottling interests in limited circumstances and, as a result, structural changes will continue to affect our consolidated financial statements in future periods. 



 Gross Profit  



        Our gross profit margin increased to 66.1 percent in 2006 from 64.5 percent in 2005. Our gross margin was favorably impacted by the change in the
business model in Spain, as discussed above. Other structural changes, which included the consolidation of Brucephil under Interpretation No. 46(R) in 2006, the acquisitions of CCCIL and TJC in
2006, and the acquisition of Bremer in 2005, unfavorably impacted our gross profit margin. Generally, bottling and finished product operations produce higher net operating revenues but lower gross
profit margins compared to concentrate and syrup operations. Our gross margin in 2006 was also impacted favorably by price increases, partially offset by increases in the cost of raw materials and
freight, primarily in North America, and by an unfavorable product mix, primarily in Japan. Gross profit margin in 2005 was favorably impacted by the receipt of approximately $109 million in
proceeds related to a class action lawsuit settlement concerning price-fixing in the sale of high fructose corn syrup ("HFCS") purchased by the Company during the years 1991 to 1995. Subsequent to the
receipt of this settlement, the Company distributed approximately $62 million to certain bottlers in North America. From 1991 to 1995, the Company purchased HFCS on behalf of those bottlers.
Therefore, those bottlers ultimately were entitled to a portion of the proceeds. The Company's portion of the settlement was approximately $47 million, which was recorded as a reduction of cost
of goods sold and impacted Corporate. Refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 


        In
2007, the Company expects the cost of raw materials to increase, primarily in North America. We will attempt to mitigate the overall impact on our business through appropriate pricing
and other strategies. 

        Our
gross profit margin decreased to 64.5 percent in 2005 from 64.7 percent in 2004, primarily due to higher raw material and freight costs driven by rising oil prices.
This decrease was partially offset by the receipt of net settlement proceeds of approximately $47 million, as discussed above. Our gross margin was also impacted by the consolidation of certain
bottling operations under Interpretation No. 46(R) as of April 2, 2004. Refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

        Total selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately 8 percent higher in 2006 versus 2005. The increases in selling and
advertising expenses were primarily related to increased investments in marketing activities, including World Cup and Winter Olympics promotions in the European Union, combined with new product
innovation activities and increased costs in our consolidated bottling investments as a result of acquisitions and consolidation of certain bottling operations. General and administrative expenses
increased due to higher costs in Bottling Investments related to the acquisitions of CCCIL and TJC and the consolidation of Brucephil under Interpretation No. 46(R). The acquisition of Bremer
during the third quarter of 2005 also increased general and administrative expenses in 2006, reflecting a full-year impact in 2006 for Bremer compared to a partial year in 2005. General
and administrative expenses in 2006 also reflected the impact of a $100 million donation made to The Coca-Cola Foundation, which impacted Corporate. Stock-based compensation expense
was flat in 2006 compared to 2005. Stock-based compensation expense in 2005 included approximately $50 million of expense due to a change in our estimated service period for retirement-eligible
participants in our plans. This amount was offset primarily by the impact of the timing of stock-based compensation grants in prior years. 

        As
of December 31, 2006, we had approximately $376 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under
our plans. This cost is expected to be recognized as stock-based compensation expense over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years. This expected cost does not include the impact of any future
stock-based compensation awards. Refer to Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

        Total
selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately 11 percent higher in 2005 versus 2004. Approximately 1 percentage point of this increase was due to an
overall weaker U.S. dollar (especially compared to the Brazilian real, the Mexican peso and the euro). The increase in selling, advertising and general and administrative expenses was primarily
related to increased marketing and innovation expenses and the full-year impact of the consolidation of certain bottling operations under Interpretation No. 46(R). The decrease in
stock-based compensation expense was primarily related to the lower average fair value per share of stock options expensed in 2005 compared to the average fair value per share expensed in 2004. This
decrease was partially offset by approximately $50 million of accelerated amortization of compensation expense related to a change in our estimated service period for retirement-eligible
participants when the terms of their stock-based compensation awards provided for accelerated vesting upon early retirement. Refer to Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

        During 2006, our Company recorded other operating charges of $185 million. Of these charges, approximately $108 million were
primarily related to the impairment of assets and investments in our bottling operations, approximately $53 million were for contract termination costs related to production capacity
efficiencies and approximately $24 million were related to other restructuring costs. None of these charges was individually significant. The impairment charges were primarily the result of a
revised outlook for certain assets and bottling operations in Asia, which have been impacted by unfavorable market conditions and declines in volume. Refer to the discussion under "Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates—Goodwill, Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets," above. 

        Other
operating charges in 2005 reflected the impact of approximately $84 million of expenses related to impairment charges for intangible assets and approximately
$1 million related to impairments of other assets. These intangible assets primarily relate to trademark beverages sold in the Philippines, which is part of East, South Asia and Pacific Rim.
Refer to the heading "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Goodwill, Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets." 


        Other
operating charges in 2004 reflected the impact of approximately $480 million of expenses primarily related to impairment charges for franchise rights and certain
manufacturing assets. Bottling Investments accounted for approximately $398 million of the impairment charges, which were primarily related to the impairment of franchise rights at CCEAG. For a
discussion of the operating environment in Germany, refer to the heading "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Goodwill, Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets." Corporate accounted
for approximately $64 million of impairment charges, which were primarily related to the impairment of certain manufacturing assets.

        As
demonstrated by the tables above, the percentage contribution to operating income and operating margin by each operating segment fluctuated from year to year. Operating income and
operating margin by operating segment were influenced by a variety of factors and events including the following: 



•In
2006, foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted operating income by approximately 1 percent, primarily related to a weaker Japanese yen, which impacted
North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East. The unfavorable impact from the weaker Japanese yen was partially offset by favorable foreign currency exchange rate changes primarily related to the euro, which
impacted the European Union and Bottling Investments, and the Brazilian real, which impacted Latin America and Bottling Investments.
•In
2006, price increases across the majority of operating segments favorably impacted both operating income and operating margins.
•In
2006, increased spending on marketing and innovation activities impacted the majority of the operating segments' operating income and operating margins. Refer to the
heading "Selling, General and Administrative Expenses."
•In
2006, operating income was reduced by approximately $3 million for Africa, $44 million for East, South Asia and Pacific Rim, $36 million for the
European Union, $17 million for North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East, $88 million for Bottling Investments and $1 million for Corporate primarily due to contract termination costs
related to production capacity efficiencies, asset impairments and other restructuring costs. Refer to Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

52




 




•In
2006, the increase in operating margin for the European Union was primarily due to a change in the business model in Spain. Refer to the headings "Net Operating Revenues"
and "Gross Profit," above.
•In
2006, the decrease in operating income and operating margin for North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East was primarily due to unfavorable product mix in Japan, which was
partially offset by increased operating income in Russia and Turkey. Operating margins in Japan are higher than the operating margins in Russia and Turkey.
•In
2006, the increase in operating income and operating margin for Bottling Investments was primarily due to price increases, favorable package mix and actions to improve
efficiency.
•In
2006, operating income was reduced by $100 million for Corporate as a result of a donation made to The Coca-Cola Foundation.
•In
2005, operating income increased approximately 7 percent. Of this amount, 4 percent was due to favorable foreign currency exchange primarily related to the
Brazilian real and the Mexican peso, which impacted Latin America and Bottling Investments, and the euro, which impacted the European Union and Bottling Investments.
•In
2005, operating income was impacted by an increase in net operating revenues and gross profit, partially offset by increased spending on marketing and innovation
activities in each operating segment. Refer to the headings "Net Operating Revenues" and "Selling, General and Administrative Expenses."
•In
2005, as a result of impairment charges totaling approximately $85 million related to the Philippines, operating margins in the East, South Asia and Pacific Rim
operating segment decreased. Refer to the heading "Other Operating Charges."
•In
2005, operating income in Corporate decreased $146 million, primarily due to increased marketing and innovation expenses, which were partially offset by our
receipt of a net settlement of approximately $47 million related to a class action lawsuit concerning the purchase of HFCS. Refer to the headings "Gross Profit" and "Selling, General and
Administrative Expenses."
•In
2004, operating income was reduced by approximately $18 million for North America, $398 million for Bottling Investments and $64 million for
Corporate as a result of impairment charges. Refer to the heading "Other Operating Charges."
•In
2004, operating income increased approximately 9 percent. Of this amount, 8 percent was due to favorable foreign currency exchange primarily related to the
euro, which impacted the European Union, and the Japanese yen, which impacted North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East.
•In
2004, as a result of the creation of a nationally integrated supply chain management company in Japan, operating margins in North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East increased.
Effective October 1, 2003, the Company and all of our bottling partners in Japan created a nationally integrated supply chain management company to centralize procurement, production and
logistics operations for the entire Coca-Cola system in Japan. As a result, a portion of our Company's business was essentially converted from a finished product business model to a
concentrate business model. This shift of certain products to a concentrate business model resulted in reductions in our revenues and cost of goods sold, each in the same amount. This change in the
business model did not impact gross profit. Generally, concentrate and syrup operations produce lower net revenues but higher operating margins compared to finished product operations.
•In
2004, as a result of the consolidation of certain bottling operations that are considered variable interest entities under Interpretation No. 46(R), operating
margin for Bottling Investments was reduced. Generally, bottling operations produce higher net revenues but lower operating margins compared to concentrate and syrup operations. 

53




 




•In
2004, operating income in Corporate increased $75 million due to the receipt of an insurance settlement related to the class action lawsuit which was settled in
2000.
•In
2004, operating income in Corporate decreased $75 million due to a donation to The Coca-Cola Foundation. 




 Interest Income and Interest Expense  



        We monitor our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt as well as our mix of short-term debt versus long-term debt. From time
to time we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. 

        In
2006, interest income decreased by $42 million compared to 2005, primarily due to lower average short-term investment balances, partially offset by higher average
interest rates. Interest expense in 2006 decreased by $20 million compared to 2005. This decrease is primarily the result of lower average balances on commercial paper borrowings, partially
offset by higher average interest rates. We expect 2007 net interest expense to increase due to forecasted lower cash balances and higher debt balances. 

        In
2005, interest income increased by $78 million compared to 2004, primarily due to higher average short-term investment balances and higher average interest rates on
U.S. dollar denominated deposits. Interest expense in 2005 increased by $44 million compared to 2004, primarily due to higher average interest rates on commercial paper borrowings in the United
States, partially offset by lower interest expense at CCEAG due to the repayment of current maturities of long-term debt in 2005. 



 Equity Income—Net  



        Our Company's share of income from equity method investments for 2006 totaled $102 million, compared to $680 million in 2005, a decrease of
$578 million. Equity income in 2006 was reduced by approximately $602 million resulting from the impact of our proportionate share of an impairment charge recorded by CCE. CCE recorded a
$2.9 billion pretax ($1.8 billion after tax) impairment of its North American franchise rights. The decline in the estimated fair value of CCE's North American franchise rights was the
result of several factors, including but not limited to (1) CCE's revised outlook on 2007 raw material costs driven by significant increases in aluminum and HFCS; (2) a challenging
marketplace environment with increased pricing pressures in several high-growth beverage categories; and (3) increased interest rates contributing to a higher discount rate and
corresponding capital charge. Our 2006 equity income—net also reflected a net decrease of approximately $37 million primarily related to other impairment and restructuring charges
recorded by CCE and certain other equity method investees, partially offset by approximately $33 million related to our proportionate share of favorable changes in certain of CCE's state and
Canadian federal and provincial tax rates. In addition, our 2006 equity income was slightly impacted by the Company's sale of shares representing 8 percent of the capital stock of
Coca-Cola FEMSA. The Company sold these shares to Fomento Economico Mexicano, S.A.B. de C.V. ("FEMSA"), the major shareowner of Coca-Cola FEMSA, in November 2006. As a result
of this sale, our ownership interest in Coca-Cola FEMSA was reduced from approximately 40 percent to approximately 32 percent. The decrease in 2006 equity income was also the
result
of the sale of a portion of our investment in Coca-Cola Icecek A.S. ("Coca-Cola Icecek") in an initial public offering during the second quarter of 2006. As a result of this
public offering, our Company's interest in Coca-Cola Icecek decreased from approximately 36 percent to approximately 20 percent. These reductions in ownership of
Coca-Cola FEMSA and Coca-Cola Icecek will reduce our future equity income related to these equity method investees. Refer to Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. The decrease in equity income for 2006 was partially offset by our Company's proportionate share of increased net income from certain of the equity method investees and our proportionate
share of the net income of the Multon juice joint venture in Russia. 

        In
February 2007, CCE announced that it would restructure segments of its Corporate, North America and European operations. As a part of the restructuring, CCE expects a net job
reduction of approximately 3,500 

54




 


positions,
or 5 percent of its total workforce. CCE expects this restructuring will result in a charge of approximately $300 million, with the majority to be recognized in 2007 and 2008.
The Company's equity income in 2007 and 2008 will reflect our proportionate share of the restructuring charges recorded by CCE. 

        Our
Company's share of income from equity method investments for 2005 totaled $680 million compared to $621 million in 2004, an increase of $59 million or
10 percent, primarily due to the overall improving health of the Coca-Cola bottling system in most of the world and the joint acquisition of Multon in April 2005. The
increase was offset by approximately $33 million related to our proportionate share of certain charges recorded by CCE. These charges included approximately $51 million, primarily
related to the tax liability resulting from the repatriation of previously unremitted foreign earnings under the Jobs Creation Act, and approximately $18 million due to restructuring charges
recorded by CCE. These charges were offset by approximately $37 million from CCE's HFCS lawsuit settlement and changes in certain of CCE's state and provincial tax rates. 



 Other Income (Loss)—Net  



        Other income (loss)—net was a net income of $195 million for 2006 compared to a net loss of $93 million for 2005, a difference of
$288 million. In 2006, other income (loss)—net included a gain of approximately $175 million resulting from the sale of a portion of our Coca-Cola FEMSA shares to
FEMSA and a gain of approximately $123 million resulting from the sale of a portion of our investment in Coca-Cola Icecek shares in an initial public offering. Refer to
Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This line item in 2006 also included $15 million in foreign currency exchange losses, the accretion of $58 million for the
discounted value of our liability to purchase CCEAG shares (refer to Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and the minority shareowners' proportional share of net income of
certain consolidated subsidiaries. 

        Other
income (loss)—net amounted to a net loss of $93 million for 2005 compared to a net loss of $82 million for 2004, a difference of $11 million. The
difference was primarily related to a reduction in foreign exchange losses. This line item in 2005 primarily consisted of $23 million in foreign currency exchange losses, the accretion of
$60 million for the discounted value of our liability to purchase CCEAG shares (refer to Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and the minority shareowners' proportional
share of net income of certain consolidated subsidiaries. 



 Gains on Issuances of Stock by Equity Method Investees  



        When one of our equity method investees issues additional shares to third parties, our percentage ownership interest in the investee decreases. In the event the
issuance price per share is higher or lower than our average carrying amount per share, we recognize a noncash gain or loss on the issuance, when appropriate. This noncash gain or loss, net of any
deferred taxes, is recognized in our net income in the period the change of ownership interest occurs. 


        In
2006, our equity method investees did not issue any additional shares to third parties that resulted in our Company recording any noncash pretax gains. 

        In
2005, our Company recorded approximately $23 million of noncash pretax gains on the issuances of stock by equity method investees. The issuances primarily related to
Coca-Cola Amatil's issuance of common stock in connection with the acquisition of SPC Ardmona Pty. Ltd., an Australian packaged fruit company. These issuances of common stock
reduced our ownership interest in the total outstanding shares of Coca-Cola Amatil from approximately 34 percent to approximately 32 percent. 


        In
2004, our Company recorded approximately $24 million of noncash pretax gains on issuances of stock by CCE. The issuances primarily related to the exercise of CCE stock options
by CCE employees at amounts greater than the book value per share of our investment in CCE. These issuances of stock reduced our 

55




 


ownership
interest in the total outstanding shares of CCE common stock from approximately 37 percent to approximately 36 percent. 



 Income Taxes  



        Our effective tax rate reflects tax benefits derived from significant operations outside the United States, which are generally taxed at rates lower than the U.S.
statutory rate of 35 percent. 

        Our
effective tax rate of approximately 22.8 percent for the year ended December 31, 2006, included the following: 



•a
tax benefit of approximately 1.8 percent primarily related to the sale of a portion of our investments in Coca-Cola Icecek and Coca-Cola
FEMSA. The tax benefit was a result of the reversal of a valuation allowance that covered certain deferred tax assets recorded on capital loss carryforwards. The reversal of the valuation allowance
was offset by a reduction of deferred tax assets due to the utilization of these capital loss carryforwards. These capital loss carryforwards offset the taxable gain on the sale of a portion of our
investments in Coca-Cola Icecek and Coca-Cola FEMSA. Also included in this tax benefit is the reversal of the deferred tax liability recorded for the differences between the
financial reporting and tax bases in the stock sold;
•an
income tax benefit primarily related to the impairment of assets and investments in our bottling operations, contract termination costs related to production capacity
efficiencies and other restructuring charges at a rate of approximately 16 percent;
•a
tax charge of approximately $24 million related to the resolution of certain tax matters; and
•an
income tax benefit related to our proportionate share of CCE's charges recorded at a rate of approximately 8.8 percent. Refer to Note 3 and Note 18
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 


        Our
effective tax rate of approximately 27.2 percent for the year ended December 31, 2005, included the following: 



•an
income tax benefit primarily related to the Philippines impairment charges at a rate of approximately 4 percent;
•an
income tax benefit of approximately $101 million related to the reversal of previously accrued taxes resulting from the favorable resolution of various tax
matters; and
•a
tax provision of approximately $315 million related to repatriation of previously unremitted foreign earnings under the Jobs Creation Act. 


        Our
effective tax rate of approximately 22.1 percent for the year ended December 31, 2004, included the following: 



•an
income tax benefit of approximately $128 million related to the reversal of previously accrued taxes resulting from the favorable resolution of various tax
matters;
•an
income tax benefit on "Other Operating Charges," discussed above, at a rate of approximately 36 percent;
•an
income tax provision of approximately $75 million related to the recording of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of CCEAG; and
•an
income tax benefit of approximately $50 million as a result of the realization of certain tax credits related to the Jobs Creation Act. 

56




 





        Based
on current tax laws, the Company's effective tax rate in 2007 is expected to be approximately 23 percent before considering the effect of any unusual or special items that
may affect our tax rate in future years. 

Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position  

        We believe our ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths. We expect cash flows from operating activities to
be strong in 2007 and in future years. Accordingly, our Company expects to meet all of our financial commitments and operating needs for the foreseeable future. We expect to use cash generated from
operating activities primarily for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and aggregate contractual obligations. 



 Cash Flows from Operating Activities  



        Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was approximately $6.0 billion, $6.4 billion
and $6.0 billion, respectively. 

        Cash
flows from operating activities decreased 7 percent in 2006 compared to 2005. This decrease was primarily the result of payments in 2006 of marketing accruals recorded in
2005 related to increased marketing and innovation activities and increased tax payments made in the first quarter of 2006 related to the 2005 repatriation of foreign earnings under the Jobs Creation
Act. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in cash receipts in 2006 from customers, which was driven by a 4 percent growth in net operating revenues. Our cash flows from operating
activities in 2006 also decreased versus 2005 as a result of a contribution of approximately $216 million to a U.S. Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association ("VEBA"), a
tax-qualified trust to fund retiree medical benefits (refer to Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and a $100 million donation made to The
Coca-Cola Foundation. 

        Cash
flows from operating activities increased 8 percent in 2005 compared to 2004. The increase was primarily related to an increase in cash receipts from customers, which was
driven by a 6 percent growth in net operating revenues. These higher cash collections were offset by increased payments to suppliers and vendors, including payments related to our increased
marketing spending. Our cash flows from operating activities in 2005 also improved versus 2004 as a result of a $137 million reduction in payments related to our 2003 streamlining initiatives.
Cash flows from operating activities in 2005 were unfavorably impacted by a $176 million increase in income tax payments primarily related to payment of a portion of the tax provision
associated with the repatriation of previously unremitted foreign earnings under the Jobs Creation Act.

acquired Sucos Mais, a Brazilian juice company, and completed the acquisition of the remaining 49 percent interest in the business of CCDA Waters L.L.C. not previously owned by our Company.
Refer to Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

        In
2004, proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment of approximately $341 million related primarily to the sale of production assets in Japan. Refer to Note 3
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2004, cash payments for acquisitions and investments were primarily related to the purchase of trademarks in Latin America.

 Debt Financing  



        Our Company maintains debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flows, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. We use debt financing to
lower our overall cost of capital, which increases our return on shareowners' equity. 

        As
of December 31, 2006, our long-term debt was rated "A+" by Standard & Poor's and "Aa3" by Moody's, and our commercial paper program was rated
"A-1" and "P-1" by Standard & Poor's and Moody's, respectively. In assessing our credit strength, both Standard & Poor's and Moody's consider our capital
structure and financial policies as well as the aggregated balance sheet and other financial information for the Company and certain bottlers, including CCE and Coca-Cola HBC. While the
Company has no legal obligation for the debt of these bottlers, the rating agencies believe the strategic importance of the bottlers to the Company's business model provides the Company with an
incentive to keep these bottlers viable. If our credit ratings were reduced by the rating agencies, our interest expense could increase. Additionally, if certain bottlers' credit ratings were to
decline, the Company's share of equity income could be reduced as a result of the potential increase in interest expense for these bottlers. 

        We
monitor our interest coverage ratio and, as indicated above, the rating agencies consider our ratio in assessing our credit ratings. However, the rating agencies aggregate financial
data for certain bottlers along with our Company when assessing our debt rating. As such, the key measure to rating agencies is the aggregate interest coverage ratio of the Company and certain
bottlers. Both Standard & Poor's and Moody's employ different aggregation methodologies and have different thresholds for the aggregate interest coverage ratio. These thresholds are not
necessarily permanent, nor are they fully disclosed to our Company. 

        Our
global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial markets around the world, enabling us to raise funds at a low effective cost. This posture, coupled with
active management of our mix of short-term and long-term debt and our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, results in a lower overall cost of
borrowing. Our debt management policies, in conjunction with our share repurchase programs and investment activity, can result in current liabilities exceeding current assets. 


        Issuances
and payments of debt included both short-term and long-term financing activities. On December 31, 2006, we had $1,952 million in lines of
credit and other short-term credit facilities available, of which approximately $225 million was outstanding. The outstanding amount of $225 million was primarily related to
our international operations. 

        The
issuances of debt in 2006 primarily included approximately $484 million of issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of greater than
90 days. The payments of debt in 2006
primarily included approximately $580 million related to commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of greater than 90 days and approximately $1,383 million
of net repayments of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less. 

        The
issuances of debt in 2005 primarily included approximately $144 million of issuances of commercial paper with maturities of 90 days or more. The payments of debt
primarily included approximately $1,037 million related to net repayments of commercial paper with maturities of less than 90 days, repayments of commercial paper with maturities greater
than 90 days of approximately $32 million and repayment of approximately $1,363 million of long-term debt. 


        The
issuances of debt in 2004 primarily included approximately $2,109 million of net issuances of commercial paper with maturities of 90 days or less, and approximately
$818 million of issuances of commercial paper with maturities of more than 90 days. The payments of debt in 2004 primarily included approximately $927 million related to
commercial paper with maturities of more than 90 days and $367 million of long-term debt.

 Share Repurchases  



        In October 1996, our Board of Directors authorized a plan ("1996 Plan") to repurchase up to 206 million shares of our Company's common stock through
2006. On July 20, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a new share repurchase program of up to 300 million shares of the Company's common stock. The new program took
effect upon the expiration of the 1996 Plan on October 31, 2006. The table below presents annual shares repurchased and average price per share:

        Since the inception of our initial share repurchase program in 1984 through our current program as of December 31, 2006, we have purchased
more than 1.2 billion shares of our Company's common stock at an average price per share of $17.53. 

        As
strong cash flows are expected to continue in the future, the Company currently expects 2007 share repurchases to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $3.0 billion. 



 Dividends  



        At its February 2007 meeting, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 10 percent, raising it to $0.34 per share, equivalent to a
full-year dividend of $1.36 per share in 2007. This is our 45th consecutive annual increase. Our annual common stock dividend was $1.24 per share, $1.12 per share and $1.00
per share in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2006 dividend represented a 10 percent increase from 2005, and the 2005 dividend represented a 12 percent increase from 2004. 



 Off–Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations  

 Off–Balance Sheet Arrangements  



        In accordance with the definition under SEC rules, the following qualify as off–balance sheet arrangements: 



•any
obligation under certain guarantee contracts;
•a
retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that
entity for such assets;
•any
obligation under certain derivative instruments; and
•any
obligation arising out of a material variable interest held by the registrant in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk
support to the registrant, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the registrant. 


        As
of December 31, 2006, our Company was contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties in the amount of approximately $270 million. Management
concluded that the likelihood of any material amounts being paid by our Company under these guarantees is not probable. As of December 31, 2006, we were not directly liable for the debt of any
unconsolidated entity, and we did not have any retained or contingent interest in assets as defined above. 

        Our
Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. 

        In
December 2003, we granted a $250 million standby line of credit to Coca-Cola FEMSA with normal market terms. This standby line of credit expired in
December 2006.

Refer to Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding short-term loans and notes payable. Upon payment of outstanding commercial paper, we typically issue new commercial paper. Lines of
credit and other short-term borrowings are expected to fluctuate depending upon current liquidity needs, especially at international subsidiaries.


2
Refer to Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our liability to CCEAG shareowners as of December 31, 2006. We paid the amount due to CCEAG shareowners in January 2007 to discharge
our liability.


3
Refer to Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding long-term debt. We will consider several alternatives to settle this long-term debt, including the use of cash flows from operating
activities, issuance of commercial paper or issuance of other long-term debt.


4
We calculated estimated interest payments for long-term debt as follows: for fixed-rate debt and term debt, we calculated interest based on the applicable rates and payment dates; for variable-rate debt and/or non-term
debt, we estimated interest rates and payment dates based on our determination of the most likely scenarios for each relevant debt instrument. We typically expect to settle such interest payments with cash flows from operating activities and/or
short-term borrowings.


5
The purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including long-term contractual obligations, open purchase orders,
accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities. We expect to fund these obligations with cash flows from operating activities.


6
We expect to fund these marketing obligations with cash flows from operating activities.





        In accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions," and SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions," as amended by SFAS No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements
No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)," the total accrued benefit liability for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of December 31, 2006, was $1,273 million. Refer
to Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This accrued liability is included in the consolidated balance sheet line item other liabilities. This amount is impacted by, among
other items, pension expense funding levels, changes in plan demographics and assumptions, investment return on plan assets, and the application of SFAS No. 158. Because the accrued liability
does not represent expected liquidity needs, we did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table.

<A
NAME="page_dw3053_1_62">  




        The Pension Protection Act of 2006 ("PPA") was enacted in August 2006 and established, among other things, new standards for funding of U.S. defined benefit pension plans. One of
the primary objectives of the PPA is to improve the financial integrity of underfunded plans through the requirement of additional contributions. The requirements of the PPA will not have a
significant impact on our financial condition because, under the provisions of the PPA, the minimum required contribution for the primary funded U.S. plan is projected to be zero through 2017 as a
result of contributions we have made to the plan since 2001. Therefore, we did not include any amounts as a contractual obligation in the above table. We may, however, decide to make additional
discretionary contributions to our pension and other benefit plans in future years. In addition, as a result of contributions totaling approximately $224 million in 2006 to fund a portion of
our U.S. postretirement healthcare obligation, including a contribution of $216 million to a VEBA trust, we do not expect to contribute to our U.S. postretirement healthcare plan in 2007. We
generally expect to fund all future contributions with cash flows from operating activities. 

        Our
international pension plans are funded in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations. We do not expect contributions to these plans to be material in 2007 or thereafter.
Therefore, no amounts have been included in the table above. 

        As
of December 31, 2006, the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. qualified pension plans was $1,660 million, and the fair value of plan assets was
$2,120 million. As of December 31, 2006, the projected benefit obligation of all pension plans other than the U.S. qualified pension plans was $1,385 million, and the fair value
of all other pension plan assets was $723 million. The majority of this underfunding is attributable to an international pension plan for certain non-U.S. employees that is unfunded
due to tax law restrictions, as well as our unfunded U.S. nonqualified pension plans. These U.S. nonqualified pension plans provide, for certain associates, benefits that are not permitted to be
funded through a qualified plan because of limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Disclosure of amounts are not included in the above table regarding expected benefit payments for our
unfunded pension plans. However, we anticipate annual benefit payments to be in the range of approximately $25 million to $30 million in 2007 and to remain at or near this annual level
for the next several years. We can not reasonably estimate these payments for 2012 and thereafter due to the ongoing nature of the obligations under these plans. 

        Deferred
income tax liabilities as of December 31, 2006, were $641 million. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This amount is not
included in the total contractual obligations table because we believe this presentation would not be meaningful. Deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between
the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their respective book
bases, which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts. The results of these calculations do not have a direct
connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods. As a result, scheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading, because this
scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs. 

        Minority
interests of $358 million as of December 31, 2006, for consolidated entities in which we do not have a 100 percent ownership interest were recorded in the
consolidated balance sheet line item other liabilities. Such minority interests are not liabilities requiring the use of cash or other resources; therefore, this amount is excluded from the
contractual obligations table. 



 Foreign Exchange  



        Our international operations are subject to opportunities and risks relating to foreign currency fluctuations and governmental actions. We closely monitor our
operations in each country and seek to adopt appropriate strategies that are responsive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 

        We
use 64 functional currencies. Due to our global operations, weaknesses in some of these currencies might be offset by strength in others. In 2006, 2005 and 2004, the weighted-average
exchange rates for foreign

        These percentages do not include the effects of our hedging activities and, therefore, do not reflect the actual impact of fluctuations in
exchange rates on our operating results. Our foreign currency management program is designed to mitigate, over time, a portion of the impact of exchange rate changes on our net income and earnings per
share. The total currency impact on operating income, including the effect of our
hedging activities, was a decrease of approximately 1 percent in 2006. The impact of a weaker U.S. dollar increased our operating income by approximately 4 percent and 8 percent
in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company currently expects currencies to have little impact on operating income in 2007. 


        Exchange
losses—net amounted to approximately $15 million in 2006, $23 million in 2005 and $39 million in 2004 and were recorded in other income
(loss)—net in our consolidated statements of income. Exchange losses—net include the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional
currencies and the costs of hedging certain exposures of our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 


        The
Company will continue to manage its foreign currency exposure to mitigate, over time, a portion of the impact of exchange rate changes on net income and earnings per share. 



 Overview of Financial Position  



        Our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006, compared to our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005, was impacted by the
following: 



•increases
in trademarks with indefinite lives, goodwill and other intangible assets of $99 million, $356 million and $859 million, respectively,
primarily due to our acquisitions of CCCIL, Apollinaris and TJC as well as the consolidation of Brucephil in 2006;
•an
increase in property, plant and equipment of $1,727 million, primarily due to 2006 purchases and acquisitions and consolidation under Interpretation
No. 46(R), as discussed above; and
•a
decrease in loans and notes payable of $1,283 million, primarily due to the net repayment of commercial paper and short-term debt during 2006. 

 Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices  



        Inflation affects the way we operate in many markets around the world. In general, we believe that, over time, we are able to increase prices to counteract the
majority of the inflationary effects of increasing costs and to generate sufficient cash flows to maintain our productive capability.

Additional Information  

        Effective January 1, 2007, we combined the Eurasia and Middle East Division, and the Russia, Ukraine and Belarus Division, both of which were previously
included in the North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East operating segment, with the India Division, previously included in the East, South Asia and Pacific Rim operating segment, to form the Eurasia
operating segment; and we combined the China Division and the Japan Division, previously included in the North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East operating segment, with the remaining East, South Asia and
Pacific Rim operating segment to form the Pacific operating segment. As a result, beginning with the first quarter of 2007, our organizational structure will consist of the following operating
segments: Africa; Eurasia; European Union; Latin America; North America; Pacific; Bottling Investments; and Corporate. 

        For
information concerning our operating segments as of December 31, 2006, refer to Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK        

        Our Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and, to a lesser
extent, adverse fluctuations in interest rates and commodity prices and other market risks. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. As a matter of policy, all our
derivative positions are used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure. Because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure, fluctuations in the
value of the instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value
of the underlying exposure. Virtually all of our derivatives are straightforward, over-the-counter instruments with liquid markets. 



 Foreign Exchange  



        We manage most of our foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows us to net certain exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets. In
2006, we generated approximately 72 percent of our net operating revenues from operations outside of the United States; therefore, weakness in one particular currency might be offset by
strengths in other currencies over time. We use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to currency fluctuations. 

        Our
Company enters into forward exchange contracts and purchases currency options (principally euro and Japanese yen) and collars to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows
denominated in foreign currencies. Additionally, we enter into forward exchange contracts to offset the earnings impact relating to exchange rate fluctuations on certain monetary assets and
liabilities. We also enter into forward exchange contracts as hedges of net investments in international operations. 



 Interest Rates  



        We monitor our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, as well as our mix of term debt versus non-term debt. From time to
time we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. 



 Value-at-Risk  



        We monitor our exposure to financial market risks using several objective measurement systems, including value-at-risk models. Our
value-at-risk calculations use a historical simulation model to estimate potential future losses in the fair value of our derivatives and other financial instruments that could
occur as a result of adverse movements in foreign currency and interest rates. We have not considered the potential impact of favorable movements in foreign currency and interest rates on our
calculations. We examined historical weekly returns over the previous 10 years to calculate our value-at-risk. The average value-at-risk
represents the simple average of quarterly amounts over the past year. As a result of our foreign currency value-at-risk calculations, we estimate
with 95 percent confidence that the fair values of our foreign currency derivatives and other financial instruments, over a one-week period, would decline by approximately
$14 million, $9 million and $17 million, respectively, using 2006, 2005 or 2004 average fair values, and by approximately $14 million and $9 million, respectively,
using December 31, 2006 and 2005 fair values. According to our interest rate value-at-risk calculations, we estimate with 95 percent confidence that any increase
in our net interest expense due to an adverse move in our 2006 average or in our December 31, 2006, interest rates over a one-week period would not have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements. Our December 31, 2005 and 2004 estimates also were not material to our consolidated financial statements.

THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS        

NOTE 1: BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Description of Business  

        The Coca-Cola Company is predominantly a manufacturer, distributor and marketer of nonalcoholic beverage concentrates and syrups. We also manufacture,
distribute and market some finished beverages. In these notes, the terms "Company," "we," "us" or "our" mean The Coca-Cola Company and all subsidiaries included in the consolidated
financial statements. We primarily sell concentrates and syrups, as well as some finished beverages, to bottling and canning operations, distributors, fountain wholesalers and fountain retailers. Our
Company owns or licenses more than 400 brands, including Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Fanta and Sprite, and a variety of diet and light beverages, waters, juice and juice drinks, teas, coffees, and energy
and sports drinks. Additionally, we have ownership interests in numerous bottling and canning operations. Significant markets for our products exist in all the world's geographic regions. 


Basis of Presentation and Consolidation  

        Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our Company consolidates all
entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest as well as variable interest entities for which our Company is the primary beneficiary. Refer to the heading "Variable Interest
Entities," below, for a discussion of variable interest entities. 

        We
use the equity method to account for our investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies. Consolidated net income
includes our Company's share of the net income of these companies. 

        We
use the cost method to account for our investments in companies that we do not control and for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and
financial policies. In accordance with the cost method, these investments are recorded at cost or fair value, as appropriate. 

        We
eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions, including the intercompany transactions with variable interest entities and the intercompany portion of
transactions with equity method investees. 

        Certain
amounts in the prior years' consolidated financial statements and notes have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 

Variable Interest Entities  

        Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities"
("Interpretation No. 46(R)") addresses the consolidation of business enterprises to which the usual condition (ownership of a majority voting interest) of consolidation does not apply.
Interpretation No. 46(R) focuses on controlling financial interests that may be achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests. It concludes that in the absence of clear
control through voting interests, a company's exposure (variable interest) to the economic risks and potential rewards from the variable interest entity's assets and activities is the best evidence of
control. If an enterprise holds a majority of the variable interests of an entity, it would be considered the primary beneficiary. Upon consolidation, the primary beneficiary is generally required to
include assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests at fair value and subsequently account for the variable interest as if it were consolidated based on majority voting interest. 

71




 


        In
our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2003, and prior to December 31, 2003, we consolidated all entities that we controlled by ownership of a majority
of voting interests. As a result of Interpretation No. 46(R), effective as of April 2, 2004, our consolidated balance sheets include the assets and liabilities of the following: 



•all
entities in which the Company has ownership of a majority of voting interests; and
•all
variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. 


        Our
Company holds interests in certain entities, primarily bottlers accounted for under the equity method of accounting prior to April 2, 2004 that are considered variable
interest entities. These variable interests relate to profit guarantees or subordinated financial support for these entities. Upon adoption of Interpretation No. 46(R) as of April 2,
2004, we consolidated assets of approximately $383 million and liabilities of approximately $383 million that were previously not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. We did not
record a cumulative effect of an accounting change, and prior periods were not restated. The results of operations of these variable interest entities were included in our consolidated results
beginning April 3, 2004, and did not have a material impact for the year ended December 31, 2004. Our Company's investment, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these variable
interest entities totaled approximately $429 million and $263 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, representing our maximum exposures to loss. Any
creditors of the variable interest entities do not have recourse against the general credit of the Company as a result of including these variable interest entities in our consolidated financial
statements. 

Use of Estimates and Assumptions  

        The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Although these estimates are based on our knowledge of
current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from estimates and assumptions. 

Risks and Uncertainties  

        Factors that could adversely impact the Company's operations or financial results include, but are not limited to, the following: obesity concerns; water scarcity
and quality; changes in the nonalcoholic beverages business environment; increased competition; inability to expand operations in developing and emerging markets; fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange and interest rates; inability to maintain good relationships with our bottling partners; a deterioration in our bottling partners' financial condition; strikes or work stoppages (including at
key manufacturing locations); increased cost of energy; increased cost, disruption of supply or shortage of raw materials; changes in laws and regulations relating to our business, including those
regarding beverage containers and packaging; additional labeling or warning requirements; unfavorable economic and political conditions in international markets; changes in commercial and market
practices within the European Economic Area; litigation or legal proceedings; adverse weather conditions; an inability to maintain brand image and product issues such as product recalls; changes in
the legal and regulatory environment in various countries in which we operate; changes in accounting and taxation standards including an increase in tax rates; an inability to achieve our overall
long-term goals; an inability to protect our information systems; future impairment charges; an inability to successfully manage our Company-owned bottling operations; and global or
regional catastrophic events. 

72




 


        Our
Company monitors our operations with a view to minimizing the impact to our overall business that could arise as a result of the risks and uncertainties inherent in our business. 


Revenue Recognition  

        Our Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of products has occurred, the sales price charged is fixed or
determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. For our Company, this generally means that we recognize revenue when title to our products is transferred to our bottling partners, resellers or
other customers. In particular, title usually transfers upon shipment to or receipt at our customers' locations, as determined by the specific sales terms of the transactions. 

        In
addition, our customers can earn certain incentives, which are included in deductions from revenue, a component of net operating revenues in the consolidated statements of income.
These incentives include, but are not limited to, cash discounts, funds for promotional and marketing activities, volume-based incentive programs and support for infrastructure programs (refer to the
heading "Other Assets"). The aggregate deductions from revenue recorded by the Company in relation to these programs, including amortization expense on infrastructure initiatives, was approximately
$3.8 billion, $3.7 billion and $3.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 

Advertising Costs  

        Our Company expenses production costs of print, radio, television and other advertisements as of the first date the advertisements take place. Advertising costs
included in selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately $2.6 billion, $2.5 billion and $2.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, advertising and production costs of approximately $214 million and $170 million, respectively, were recorded in prepaid
expenses and other assets and in noncurrent other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. 

Stock-Based Compensation  

        Our Company currently sponsors stock option plans and restricted stock award plans. Refer to Note 15. Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company
accounted for these plans under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation."
Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share Based Payment" ("SFAS No. 123(R)"). Our Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the
modified prospective method. Based on the terms of our plans, our Company did not have a cumulative effect related to our plans. The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) did not have a material impact
on our stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2006. Further, we believe the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) will not have a material impact on our Company's future
stock-based compensation expense. The fair values of the stock awards are determined using an estimated expected life. The Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis
over the period the award is earned by the employee. 

        Our
equity method investees also adopted SFAS No. 123(R) effective January 1, 2006. Our proportionate share of the stock-based compensation expense resulting from the
adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) by our equity method investees is recognized as a reduction of equity income. The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) by our equity method investees did not have a
material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

73




 

Issuances of Stock by Equity Method Investees  

        When one of our equity method investees issues additional shares to third parties, our percentage ownership interest in the investee decreases. In the event the
issuance price per share is higher or lower than our average carrying amount per share, we recognize a noncash gain or loss on the issuance. This noncash gain or loss, net of any deferred taxes, is
generally recognized in our net income in the period the change in ownership interest occurs. 


        If
gains or losses have been previously recognized on issuances of an equity method investee's stock and shares of the equity method investee are subsequently repurchased by the equity
method investee, gain or loss recognition does not occur on issuances subsequent to the date of a repurchase until shares have been issued in an amount equivalent to the number of repurchased shares.
This type of transaction is reflected as an equity transaction, and the net effect is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 4. 

Income Taxes  

        Income tax expense includes United States, state, local and international income taxes, plus a provision for U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign
subsidiaries not deemed to be indefinitely reinvested. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax
basis of existing assets and liabilities. The tax rate used to determine the deferred tax assets and liabilities is the enacted tax rate for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. Refer to Note 17. 

Net Income Per Share  

        Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted net
income per share is computed similarly to basic net income per share except that it includes the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities were exercised. Approximately
175 million, 180 million and 151 million stock option awards were excluded from the computations of diluted net income per share in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, because the
awards would have been antidilutive for the periods presented. 

Cash Equivalents  

        We classify marketable securities that are highly liquid and have maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase as cash equivalents. We manage our
exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties and procedures to monitor our credit risk concentrations. 

Trade Accounts Receivable  

        We record trade accounts receivable at net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any loss
anticipated on the trade accounts receivable balances and charged to the provision for doubtful accounts. We calculate this allowance based on our history of write-offs, level of past-due
accounts based on the contractual terms of the receivables, and our relationships with and the economic status of our bottling partners and customers.

        A significant portion of our net operating revenues is derived from sales of our products in international markets. Refer to Note 20. We
also generate a significant portion of our net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to bottlers in which we have a noncontrolling interest, including Coca-Cola
Enterprises Inc. ("CCE"), Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company S.A. ("Coca-Cola HBC"), Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. ("Coca-Cola FEMSA") and
Coca-Cola Amatil Limited ("Coca-Cola Amatil"). Refer to Note 3. 


Inventories  

        Inventories consist primarily of raw materials and packaging (which includes ingredients and supplies) and finished goods (which includes concentrates and syrups
in our concentrate and foodservice operations, and finished beverages in our bottling and canning operations). Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. We determine cost on the basis of
the average cost or first-in, first-out methods. Refer to Note 2. 

Recoverability of Equity Method and Cost Method Investments  

        Management periodically assesses the recoverability of our Company's equity method and cost method investments. For publicly traded investments, readily available
quoted market prices are an indication of the fair value of our Company's investments. For nonpublicly traded investments, if an identified event or change in circumstances requires an impairment
evaluation, management assesses fair value based on valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds and external appraisals, as appropriate. We consider the
assumptions that we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flows and estimates of sales proceeds valuation
methodologies. If an investment is considered to be impaired and the decline in value is other than temporary, we record a write-down. 


Other Assets  

        Our Company advances payments to certain customers for marketing to fund future activities intended to generate profitable volume, and we expense such payments
over the applicable period. Advance payments are also made to certain customers for distribution rights. Additionally, our Company invests in infrastructure programs with our bottlers that are
directed at strengthening our bottling system and increasing unit case volume. When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable, management evaluates
the recoverability of these assets by preparing estimates of sales volume, the resulting gross profit and cash flows. Costs of these programs are recorded in prepaid expenses and other assets and 

75




 


noncurrent
other assets and are being amortized over the remaining periods to be directly benefited, which range from 1 to 12 years. Amortization expense for infrastructure programs was
approximately $136 million, $134 million and $136 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Refer to heading "Revenue Recognition," above,
and Note 3. 

Property, Plant and Equipment  

        Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Repair and maintenance costs that do not improve service potential or extend economic life are expensed as
incurred. Depreciation is recorded principally by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of our assets, which generally have the following ranges: buildings and
improvements: 40 years or less; machinery and equipment: 15 years or less; containers: 10 years or less. Land is not depreciated, and construction in progress is not depreciated
until ready for service and capitalized. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term, including renewals that are
deemed to be reasonably assured, or the estimated useful life of the improvement. Depreciation expense totaled approximately $763 million, $752 million and $715 million for the
years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Amortization expense for leasehold improvements totaled approximately $21 million, $17 million and $7 million
for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Refer to Note 5. 

        Management
assesses the recoverability of the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment if certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such
assets may not be recoverable, such as a significant decrease in market value of the assets or a significant change in the business conditions in a particular market. If we determine that the carrying
value of an asset is not recoverable based on expected undiscounted future cash flows, excluding interest charges, we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the asset
over its fair value. 

Goodwill, Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets  

        In accordance with SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," we classify intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets
with definite lives subject to amortization, (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization, and (3) goodwill. We test intangible assets with definite lives for
impairment if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Such conditions may include an economic downturn in a geographic market or a change in the assessment of future
operations. We record an impairment charge when the carrying value of the definite lived intangible asset is not recoverable by the cash flows generated from the use of the asset. 

        Intangible
assets with indefinite lives and goodwill are not amortized. We test these intangible assets and goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or
circumstances indicate that such intangible assets or goodwill might be impaired. Such tests for impairment are also required for intangible assets with indefinite lives and/or goodwill recorded by
our equity method investees. All goodwill is assigned to reporting units, which are one level below our operating segments. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that benefits from the synergies
arising from each business combination. We perform our impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level. Such impairment tests for goodwill include comparing the fair value of the respective
reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. We use a variety of methodologies in conducting these impairment tests, including discounted cash flow analyses with a number of scenarios,
where applicable, that are weighted based on the probability of different outcomes. When appropriate, we consider the 

76




 


assumptions
that we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use in estimating future cash flows. In addition, where applicable, an appropriate discount rate is used, based on the Company's
cost of capital rate or location-specific economic factors. When the fair value is less than the carrying value of the intangible assets or the reporting unit, we record an impairment charge to reduce
the carrying value of the assets to fair value. These impairment charges are generally recorded in the line item other operating charges or, to the extent they relate to equity method investees, as a
reduction of equity income—net, in the consolidated statements of income. 

        Our
Company determines the useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets after considering the specific facts and circumstances related to each intangible asset. Factors we consider
when determining useful lives include the contractual term of any agreement, the history of the asset, the Company's long-term strategy for the use of the asset, any laws or other local
regulations which could impact the useful life of the asset, and other economic factors, including competition and specific market conditions. Intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives
are amortized, generally on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, ranging from 1 to 45 years. Intangible assets with definite lives have estimated remaining useful lives
ranging from 1 to 35 years. Refer to Note 6. 

Derivative Financial Instruments  

        Our Company accounts for derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,"
as amended by SFAS No. 137, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities—Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133—an amendment of
FASB Statement No. 133," SFAS No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities—an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133," and SFAS
No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." We recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our consolidated
balance sheets, with fair values of foreign currency derivatives estimated based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. Refer to Note 12. 

Retirement-Related Benefits  

        Using appropriate actuarial methods and assumptions, our Company accounts for defined benefit pension plans in accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers'
Accounting for Pensions," and we account for our nonpension postretirement benefits in accordance with SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," as
amended by SFAS No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)."
Effective December 31, 2006 for our Company, SFAS No. 158 requires that previously unrecognized actuarial gains or losses, prior service costs or credits and transition obligations or
assets be recognized generally through adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income and credits to prepaid benefit cost or accrued benefit liability. As a result of these adjustments, the
current funded status of defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans is reflected in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006. Refer to
Note 16. 

        Our
equity method investees also adopted SFAS No. 158 effective December 31, 2006. Refer to Note 3 for the impact on our consolidated balance sheet resulting from
the adoption of SFAS No. 158 by our equity method investees.

Contingencies  

        Our Company is involved in various legal proceedings and tax matters. Due to their nature, such legal proceedings and tax matters involve inherent uncertainties
including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties and governmental actions. Management assesses the probability of loss for such contingencies and accrues a liability
and/or discloses the relevant circumstances, as appropriate. Refer to Note 13. 

Business Combinations  

        In accordance with SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations," we account for all business combinations by the purchase method. Furthermore, we recognize
intangible assets apart from goodwill if they arise from contractual or legal rights or if they are separable from goodwill. 


Recent Accounting Standards and Pronouncements  

        In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities—Including an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 115." SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which
the fair value option has been elected will be recognized in
earnings at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS No. 159 is effective for our Company January 1, 2008. The Company is evaluating the impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 159 will
have on our consolidated financial statements. 

        In
September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff published Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 108,  "Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying
Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements." SAB No. 108 addresses
quantifying the financial statement effects of misstatements, specifically, how the effects of prior year uncorrected errors must be considered in quantifying misstatements in the current year
financial statements. SAB No. 108 is effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. The adoption of SAB No. 108 by our Company in the fourth quarter of 2006 did not
have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

        As
previously discussed, our Company adopted SFAS No. 158 related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. Refer to Note 16. 

        In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements." SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and
expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for our Company January 1, 2008. We believe that the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will not
have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

        In
July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" ("Interpretation No. 48"). Interpretation No. 48
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." Interpretation
No. 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
Interpretation No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. For our Company, Interpretation
No. 48 was effective beginning January 1, 2007, and the cumulative effect adjustment will be recorded in the first quarter of 2007. We believe that the adoption of Interpretation
No. 48 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

        In
May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, "Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 20 and FASB
Statement No. 3." SFAS No. 154 requires 

78




 


retrospective
application to prior periods' financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable. APB Opinion No. 20, "Accounting Changes," previously
required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle.
SFAS No. 154 became effective for our Company on January 1, 2006. The adoption of SFAS No. 154 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

        In
December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, "Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29." SFAS No. 153 is based on the principle
that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. APB Opinion No. 29, "Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions," provided an exception to
its basic measurement principle (fair value) for exchanges of similar productive assets. Under APB Opinion No. 29, an exchange of a productive asset for a similar productive asset was based on
the recorded amount of the asset relinquished. SFAS No. 153 eliminates this exception and replaces it with an exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial
substance. SFAS No. 153 became effective for our Company as of July 2, 2005, and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

        As
previously discussed, our Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R) related to share based payments. Refer to Note 15. 


        During
2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 106-2, "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act
of 2003" ("FSP 106-2"). FSP 106-2 relates to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the "Act"). The Act introduced a prescription drug
benefit under Medicare known as Medicare Part D. The Act also established a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially
equivalent to Medicare Part D. During the second quarter of 2004, our Company adopted the provisions of FSP 106-2 retroactive to January 1, 2004. The adoption of FSP
106-2 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 16. 


        In
November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costs, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4." SFAS No. 151 requires that
abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials (spoilage) be recorded as current period charges and that the allocation of fixed production overheads to
inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The Company adopted SFAS No. 151 on January 1, 2006. The adoption of SFAS No. 151 did not have a material
impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

        In
October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "Jobs Creation Act") was signed into law. The Jobs Creation Act includes a temporary incentive for U.S. multinationals
to repatriate foreign earnings at an approximate 5.25 percent effective tax rate. Issued in December 2004, FASB Staff Position 109-2, "Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for
the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004" ("FSP 109-2"), indicated that the lack of clarification of certain provisions within the Jobs
Creation Act and the timing of the enactment necessitated a practical exception to the SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," requirement to reflect in the period of enactment the effect
of a new tax law. Accordingly, enterprises were allowed time beyond 2004 to evaluate the effect of the Jobs Creation Act on their plans for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for
purposes of applying SFAS No. 109. Accordingly, in 2005, the Company repatriated $6.1 billion of its previously unremitted earnings and recorded an associated tax expense of
approximately $315 million. Refer to Note 17. 

        In
2004, our Company recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $50 million as a result of the realization of certain tax credits related to certain provisions of the Jobs
Creation Act not related to repatriation provisions. Refer to Note 17.

NOTE 3: BOTTLING INVESTMENTS  

Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.  

        CCE is a marketer, producer and distributor of bottle and can nonalcoholic beverages, operating in eight countries. As of December 31, 2006, our Company
owned approximately 35 percent of the outstanding common stock of CCE. We account for our investment by the equity method of accounting and, therefore, our net income includes our proportionate
share of income resulting from our investment in CCE. As of December 31, 2006, our proportionate share of the net assets of CCE exceeded our investment by approximately $282 million.

        Syrup and finished product purchases from CCE represent purchases of fountain syrup in certain territories that have been resold by our Company to
major customers and purchases of bottle and can products. Marketing payments made by us directly to CCE represent support of certain marketing activities and our participation with CCE in cooperative
advertising and other marketing activities to promote the sale of Company trademark products within CCE territories. These programs are agreed to on an annual basis. Marketing payments made to third
parties on behalf of CCE represent support of certain marketing activities and programs to promote the sale of Company trademark products within CCE's territories in conjunction with certain of CCE's
customers. Pursuant to cooperative advertising and trade agreements with CCE, we received funds from CCE for local media and marketing program reimbursements. Payments made to CCE for dispensing
equipment repair services represent reimbursement to CCE for its costs of parts and labor for repairs on cooler, dispensing, or post-mix equipment owned by us or our customers. The Other
payments—net line in the table above represents payments made to and received from CCE that are individually not significant. 

        In
2006, our Company's equity income related to CCE decreased by approximately $587 million, related to our proportionate share of certain items recorded by CCE. Our proportionate
share of these items included approximately $602 million resulting from the impact of an impairment charge recorded by CCE. CCE recorded a $2.9 billion pretax ($1.8 billion after
tax) impairment of its North American franchise rights. The
decline in the estimated fair value of CCE's North American franchise rights was the result of several factors, including but not limited to (1) CCE's revised outlook on 2007 raw material costs
driven by significant increases in aluminum and high fructose corn syrup ("HFCS"); (2) a challenging marketplace environment with increased pricing pressures in several high-growth
beverage categories; and (3) increased interest rates contributing to a higher discount rate and corresponding capital charge. Our proportionate share of CCE's charges also included
approximately $18 million due to restructuring charges recorded by CCE. These charges were partially offset by approximately $33 million related to our proportionate share of changes in
certain of CCE's state and Canadian federal and provincial tax rates. All of these charges and changes impacted our Bottling Investments operating segment. 

        In
2005, our equity income related to CCE was reduced by approximately $33 million related to our proportionate share of certain charges and gains recorded by CCE. Our
proportionate share of CCE's charges included an approximate $51 million decrease to equity income, primarily related to the tax liability recorded by CCE in the fourth quarter of 2005
resulting from the repatriation of previously unremitted foreign earnings under the Jobs Creation Act and approximately $18 million due to restructuring charges recorded by CCE. These
restructuring charges were primarily related to workforce reductions associated with the reorganization of CCE's North American operations, changes in executive management and elimination of certain
positions in 

81




 


CCE's
corporate headquarters. These charges were partially offset by an approximate $37 million increase to equity income in the second quarter of 2005 resulting from CCE's HFCS lawsuit
settlement proceeds and changes in certain of CCE's state and provincial tax rates. Refer to Note 18. 


        In
the second quarter of 2004, our Company and CCE agreed to terminate the Sales Growth Initiative ("SGI") agreement and certain other marketing funding programs that were previously in
place. Due to termination of these agreements, a significant portion of the cash payments to be made by us directly to CCE was eliminated prospectively. At the termination of these agreements, we
agreed that the concentrate price that CCE pays us for sales made in the United States and Canada would be reduced. Total cash support paid by our Company under the SGI agreement prior to its
termination was approximately $58 million and approximately $161 million for 2004 and 2003, respectively. These amounts are included in the line item marketing payments made by us
directly to CCE in the table above. 

        In
the second quarter of 2004, our Company and CCE agreed to establish a Global Marketing Fund, under which we expect to pay CCE $62 million annually through December 31,
2014, as support for certain marketing activities. The term of the agreement will automatically be extended for successive 10-year periods thereafter unless either party gives written
notice of termination of this agreement. The marketing activities to be funded under this agreement will be agreed upon each year as part of the annual joint planning process and will be incorporated
into the annual marketing plans of both companies. We paid CCE a prorated amount of $42 million for 2004. The prorated amount was determined based on the agreement date. These amounts are
included in the line item marketing payments made by us directly to CCE in the table above. 


        Our
Company previously entered into programs with CCE designed to help develop cold-drink infrastructure. Under these programs, our Company paid CCE for a portion of the cost
of developing the infrastructure necessary to support accelerated placements of cold-drink equipment. These payments support a common objective of increased sales of Company trademarked
beverages from increased availability and consumption in the cold-drink channel. In connection with these programs, CCE agreed to: 



(1)purchase
and place specified numbers of Company-approved cold-drink equipment each year through 2010;
(2)maintain
the equipment in service, with certain exceptions, for a period of at least 12 years after placement;
(3)maintain
and stock the equipment in accordance with specified standards; and
(4)annual
reporting to our Company of minimum average annual unit case volume throughout the economic life of the equipment and other specified information. 


        CCE
must achieve minimum average unit case volume for a 12-year period following the placement of equipment. These minimum average unit case volume levels ensure adequate
gross profit from sales of concentrate to fully recover the capitalized costs plus a return on the Company's investment. Should CCE fail to purchase the specified numbers of cold-drink
equipment for any calendar year through 2010, the parties agreed to mutually develop a reasonable solution. Should no mutually agreeable solution be developed, or in the event that CCE otherwise
breaches any material obligation under the contracts and such breach is not remedied within a stated period, then CCE would be required to repay a portion of the support funding as determined by our
Company. In the third quarter of 2004, our Company and CCE agreed to amend the contract to defer the placement of some equipment from 2004 and 2005, as previously agreed under the original contract,
to 2009 and 

82




 

2010.
In connection with this amendment, CCE agreed to pay the Company approximately $2 million in 2004, $3 million annually in 2005 through 2008, and $1 million in 2009. In 2005,
our Company and CCE agreed to amend the contract for North America to move to a system of purchase and placement credits, whereby CCE earns credit toward its annual purchase and placement requirements
based upon the type of equipment it purchases and places. The amended contract also provides that no breach by CCE will occur even if they do not achieve the required number of purchase and placement
credits in any given year, so long as (1) the shortfall does not exceed 20 percent of the required purchase and placement credits for that year; (2) a compensating payment is made
to our Company by CCE; (3) the shortfall is corrected in the following year; and (4) CCE meets all specified purchase and placement credit requirements by the end of 2010. The payments
we made to CCE under these programs are recorded in prepaid expenses and other assets and in noncurrent other assets and amortized as deductions from revenues over the 10-year period
following the placement of the equipment. Our carrying values for these infrastructure programs with CCE were approximately $576 million and $662 million as of December 31, 2006
and 2005, respectively. The Company has no further commitments under these programs. 

        In
March 2004, the Company and CCE launched the Dasani water brand in Great Britain. The product was voluntarily recalled. During 2004, our Company reimbursed CCE
$32 million for product recall costs incurred by CCE. 

        Effective
December 31, 2006, CCE adopted SFAS No. 158. Our proportionate share of the impact of CCE's adoption of SFAS No. 158 was an approximate $132 million
pretax ($84 million after tax) reduction in both the carrying value of our investment in CCE and our accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI"). Refer to Note 10 and
Note 16. 

        If
valued at the December 31, 2006 quoted closing price of CCE shares, the fair value of our investment in CCE would have exceeded our carrying value by approximately
$2.1 billion. 

Other Equity Method Investments  

        Our other equity method investments include our ownership interests in Coca-Cola HBC, Coca-Cola FEMSA and Coca-Cola Amatil. As
of December 31, 2006, we owned approximately 23 percent, 32 percent and 32 percent, respectively, of these companies' common shares. 


        Operating
results include our proportionate share of income (loss) from our equity method investments. As of December 31, 2006, our investment in our equity method investees in
the aggregate, other than CCE, exceeded our proportionate share of the net assets of these equity method investees by approximately $1,375 million. This difference is not amortized.

        Net sales to equity method investees other than CCE, the majority of which are located outside the United States, were approximately
$7.6 billion in 2006, $7.4 billion in 2005 and $5.2 billion in 2004. Total support payments, primarily marketing, made to equity method investees other than CCE were approximately
$512 million, $475 million and $442 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 

        In
2003, one of our Company's equity method investees, Coca-Cola FEMSA, consummated a merger with another of the Company's equity method investees, Panamerican
Beverages, Inc. At the time of the merger, the Company and Fomento Economico Mexicano, S.A.B. de C.V. ("FEMSA"), the major shareowner of Coca-Cola FEMSA, reached an understanding
under which this shareowner could purchase from our Company an amount of Coca-Cola FEMSA shares sufficient for this shareowner to regain majority ownership interest in
Coca-Cola FEMSA. That understanding expired in May 2006; however, in the third quarter of 2006, the Company and the shareowner reached an agreement under which the Company would
sell a number of shares representing 8 percent of the capital stock of Coca-Cola FEMSA to FEMSA. As a result of this sale, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company
received cash proceeds of approximately $427 million and realized a gain of approximately $175 million, which was recorded in the consolidated statement of income line item other income
(loss)—net and impacted the Corporate operating segment. Also as a result of this sale, our ownership interest in Coca-Cola FEMSA was reduced from approximately
40 percent to approximately 32 percent. Refer to Note 18. 

84




 


        In
2006, our Company sold a portion of our investment in Coca-Cola Icecek A.S. ("Coca-Cola Icecek"), an equity method investee bottler incorporated in Turkey, in
an initial public offering. Our Company received cash proceeds of approximately $198 million and realized a gain of approximately $123 million, which was recorded in the consolidated
statement of income line item other income (loss)—net and impacted the Corporate operating segment. As a result of this public offering, our Company's interest in Coca-Cola
Icecek decreased from approximately 36 percent to approximately 20 percent. Refer to Note 18. 

        Our
Company owns a 50 percent interest in Multon, a Russian juice business ("Multon"), which we acquired in April 2005 jointly with Coca-Cola HBC, for a total
purchase price of approximately $501 million, split equally between the Company and Coca-Cola HBC. Multon produces and distributes juice products under the Dobriy, Rich, Nico and
other trademarks in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. Equity income—net includes our proportionate share of Multon's net income beginning April 20, 2005. Refer to Note 19. 


        During
the second quarter of 2004, the Company's equity income benefited by approximately $37 million for its share of a favorable tax settlement related to Coca-Cola
FEMSA. 

        In
December 2004, the Company sold to an unrelated financial institution certain of its production assets that were previously leased to the Japanese supply chain management
company (refer to discussion below). The assets were sold for approximately $271 million, and the sale resulted in no gain or loss. The financial institution entered into a leasing arrangement
with the Japanese supply chain management company. These assets were previously reported in our consolidated balance sheet line item property, plant and equipment—net and assigned to our
North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East operating segment. 

        During
2004, our Company sold our bottling operations in Vietnam, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Nepal to Coca-Cola Sabco (Pty) Ltd. ("Sabco") for a total consideration of
$29 million. In addition, Sabco assumed certain debts of these bottling operations. The proceeds from the sale of these bottlers were approximately equal to the carrying value of the
investment. 

        Effective
October 1, 2003, the Company and all of its bottling partners in Japan created a nationally integrated supply chain management company to centralize procurement,
production and logistics operations for the entire Coca-Cola system in Japan. As a result of the creation of this supply chain management company in Japan, a portion of our Company's
business was essentially converted from a finished product business model to a concentrate business model, thus reducing our net operating revenues and cost of goods sold by the same amounts. The
formation of this entity included the sale of Company inventory and leasing of certain Company assets to this new entity on October 1, 2003, as well as our recording of a liability for certain
contractual obligations to Japanese bottlers. Such amounts were not material to the Company's results of operations. 

        Effective
December 31, 2006, our equity method investees other than CCE also adopted SFAS No. 158. Our proportionate share of the impact of the adoption of SFAS
No. 158 by our equity method investees other than CCE was an approximate $18 million pretax ($12 million after tax) reduction in the carrying value of our investments in those
equity method investees and our AOCI. Refer to Note 10 and Note 16. 

        If
valued at the December 31, 2006, quoted closing prices of shares actively traded on stock markets, the value of our equity method investments in publicly traded bottlers other
than CCE would have exceeded our carrying value by approximately $3.6 billion.

Net Receivables and Dividends from Equity Method Investees  

        The total amount of net receivables due from equity method investees, including CCE, was approximately $857 million and $644 million as of
December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The total amount of dividends received from equity method investees, including CCE, was approximately $226 million, $234 million and
$145 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 


NOTE 4: ISSUANCES OF STOCK BY EQUITY METHOD INVESTEES  

        In 2006, our equity method investees did not issue any additional shares to third parties that resulted in our Company recording any noncash pretax gains. 

        In
2005, our Company recorded approximately $23 million of noncash pretax gains on issuances of stock by equity method investees. We recorded deferred taxes of approximately
$8 million on these gains. These gains primarily related to an issuance of common stock by Coca-Cola Amatil, which was valued at an amount greater than the book value per share of
our investment in Coca-Cola Amatil. Coca-Cola Amatil issued approximately 34 million shares of common stock with a fair value of $5.78 each in connection with the
acquisition of SPC Ardmona Pty. Ltd., an Australian packaged fruit company. This issuance of common stock reduced our ownership interest in the total outstanding shares of Coca-Cola
Amatil from approximately 34 percent to approximately 32 percent. 

        In
2004, our Company recorded approximately $24 million of noncash pretax gains on issuances of stock by CCE. The issuances primarily related to the exercise of CCE stock options
by CCE employees at amounts greater than the book value per share of our investment in CCE. We recorded deferred taxes of approximately $9 million on these gains. These issuances of stock
reduced our ownership interest in the total outstanding shares of CCE from approximately 37 percent to approximately 36 percent.

        In 2006, our Company recorded impairment charges of approximately $41 million primarily related to trademarks for beverages sold in the
Philippines and Indonesia. The Philippines and Indonesia are components of our East, South Asia and Pacific Rim operating segment. The amount of these impairment charges was determined by comparing
the fair values of the intangible assets to their respective carrying values. The fair values were determined using discounted cash flow analyses. Because the fair values were less than the carrying
values of the assets, we recorded impairment charges to reduce the carrying values of the assets to their respective fair values. These impairment charges were recorded in the line item other
operating charges in the consolidated statement of income. Refer to Note 18. 

        In
2005, our Company recorded an impairment charge related to trademarks for beverages sold in the Philippines of approximately $84 million. The carrying value of our trademarks
in the Philippines, prior to the recording of the impairment charges in 2005, was approximately $268 million. The impairment was the result of our revised outlook for the Philippines, which had
been unfavorably impacted by declines in volume and income before income taxes resulting from the continued lack of an affordable package offering and the continued limited availability of these
trademark beverages in the marketplace. We determined the amount of this impairment charge by comparing the fair value of the intangible assets to the carrying value. Fair values were derived using
discounted cash flow analyses with a number of scenarios that were weighted based on the probability of different outcomes. Because the fair value was less than the carrying value of the assets, we
recorded an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the assets to fair value. This impairment charge was recorded in the line item other operating charges in the consolidated statement of
income.

NOTE 8: SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS  

       Loans and notes payable consist primarily of commercial paper issued in the United States and a liability to acquire the remaining approximate 59 percent
of the outstanding stock of Coca-Cola Erfrischungsgetraenke AG ("CCEAG"). As of December 31, 2006, the Company owned approximately 41 percent of CCEAG's outstanding stock. In
February 2002, the Company acquired control of CCEAG and agreed to put/call agreements with the other shareowners of CCEAG, which resulted in the recording of a liability to acquire the
remaining shares in CCEAG. The present value of the total amount to be paid by our Company to all other CCEAG shareowners was approximately $1,068 million at December 31, 2006, and
approximately $941 million at December 31, 2005. This amount increased from the initial liability of approximately $600 million due to the accretion of the discounted value to the
ultimate maturity of the liability and the translation adjustment related to this liability, partially offset by payments made to the other CCEAG shareowners during the term of the agreements. The
accretion of the discounted value to its ultimate maturity value is recorded in the line item other income (loss)—net, and this amount
was approximately $58 million, $60 million and $58 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. 


        As
of December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had approximately $1,942 million and $3,311 million, respectively, outstanding in commercial paper borrowings. Our
weighted-average interest rates for commercial paper outstanding were approximately 5.2 percent and 4.2 percent per year at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In addition,
we had $1,952 million in lines of credit and other short-term credit facilities available as of December 31, 2006, of which approximately $225 million was outstanding.
The outstanding amount of approximately $225 million was primarily related to our international operations. Included in the available credit facilities discussed above, the Company had
$1,150 million in lines of credit for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper backup. There were no borrowings under these lines of credit during 2006. 


        These
credit facilities are subject to normal banking terms and conditions. Some of the financial arrangements require compensating balances, none of which is presently significant to
our Company.

NOTE 11: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  

Certain Debt and Marketable Equity Securities  

        Investments in debt and marketable equity securities, other than investments accounted for by the equity method, are categorized as trading,
available-for-sale or held-to-maturity. Our marketable equity investments are categorized as trading or available-for-sale with
their cost basis determined by the specific identification method. Trading securities are carried at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses included in net income. We record
available-for-sale instruments at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred income taxes, reported as a component of AOCI. Debt securities categorized as
held-to-maturity are stated at amortized cost.

        For
the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, gross realized gains and losses on sales of trading and available-for-sale securities were not
material. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. 

Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments  

        The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and loans and notes payable approximate their fair values
because of the relatively short-term maturity of these instruments. 

        We
estimate that the fair values of non-marketable cost method investments approximate their carrying amounts. 

93






<A
NAME="page_fu3053_1_94">  

        We
carry our non-marketable cost method investments at cost or, if a decline in the value of the investment is deemed to be other than temporary, at fair value. Estimates of
fair value are generally based upon discounted cash flow analyses. 


        We
recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets, with fair values estimated based on quoted market prices or
pricing models using current market rates. Virtually all of our derivatives are straightforward, over-the-counter instruments with liquid markets. For further discussion of our
derivatives, including a disclosure of derivative values, refer to Note 12. 

        The
fair value of our long-term debt is estimated based on quoted prices for those or similar instruments. As of December 31, 2006, the carrying amounts and fair
values of our long-term debt, including the current portion, were approximately $1,347 million and approximately $1,386 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2005,
these carrying amounts and fair values were approximately $1,182 million and approximately $1,240 million, respectively. 

NOTE 12: HEDGING TRANSACTIONS AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  

        When deemed appropriate our Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates and foreign
currency exchange rates, commodity prices and other market risks. Derivative instruments used to manage fluctuations in commodity prices were not material to the consolidated financial statements for
the three years ended December 31, 2006. The Company
formally designates and documents the financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure, as well as the risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge
transactions. The Company formally assesses, both at the inception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the financial instruments that are used in hedging transactions are effective at
offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the related underlying exposure. Because of the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure
being hedged, fluctuations in the value of the derivative instruments are generally offset by changes in the fair values or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. Any ineffective portion
of a financial instrument's change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings. Virtually all of our derivatives are straightforward over-the-counter instruments with
liquid markets. Our Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 

        The
fair values of derivatives used to hedge or modify our risks fluctuate over time. We do not view these fair value amounts in isolation, but rather in relation to the fair values or
cash flows of the underlying hedged transactions or other exposures. The notional amounts of the derivative financial instruments do not necessarily represent amounts exchanged by the parties and,
therefore, are not a direct measure of our exposure to the financial risks described above. The amounts exchanged are calculated by reference to the notional amounts and by other terms of the
derivatives, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates or other financial indices. 

        Our
Company recognizes all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The accounting for changes in fair value of a
derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, further, on the type of hedging relationship. At the inception of the hedging
relationship, the Company must designate the instrument as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. This designation is based upon the exposure
being hedged. 

94




 


        We
have established strict counterparty credit guidelines and enter into transactions only with financial institutions of investment grade or better. We monitor counterparty exposures
daily and review any downgrade in credit rating immediately. If a downgrade in the credit rating of a counterparty were to occur, we have provisions requiring collateral in the form of U.S. government
securities for substantially all of our transactions. To mitigate presettlement risk, minimum credit standards become more stringent as the duration of the derivative financial instrument increases.
To minimize the concentration of credit risk, we enter into derivative transactions with a portfolio of financial institutions. The Company has master netting agreements with most of the financial
institutions that are counterparties to the derivative instruments. These agreements allow for the net settlement of assets and liabilities arising from different transactions with the same
counterparty. Based on these factors, we consider the risk of counterparty default to be minimal. 

Interest Rate Management  

        Our Company monitors our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt as well as our mix of term debt versus non-term debt. This
monitoring includes a review of business and other financial risks. We also enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt.
Interest rate swap agreements that meet certain conditions required under SFAS No. 133 for fair value hedges are accounted for as such, with the offset recorded to adjust the fair value of the
underlying exposure being hedged. The Company had no outstanding interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. The Company estimates the fair value of its interest rate derivatives
based on quoted market prices. Any ineffective portion, which was not significant in 2006, 2005 or 2004, of the changes in the fair value of these instruments was immediately recognized in net income. 


Foreign Currency Management  

        The purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to reduce the risk that our eventual U.S. dollar net cash inflows resulting from sales outside the
United States will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 

        We
enter into forward exchange contracts and purchase foreign currency options (principally euro and Japanese yen) and collars to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows
denominated in foreign currencies. The effective portion of the changes in fair value for these contracts, which have been designated as cash flow hedges, was reported in AOCI and reclassified into
earnings in the same financial statement line item and in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any ineffective portion, which was not significant in 2006,
2005 or 2004, of the change in the fair value of these instruments was immediately recognized in net income. 

        Additionally,
the Company enters into forward exchange contracts that are effective economic hedges and are not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133. These
instruments are used to offset the earnings impact relating to the variability in foreign currency exchange rates on certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies.
Changes in the fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in earnings in the line item other income (loss)—net of our consolidated statements of income to offset the effect
of remeasurement of the monetary assets and liabilities. 

        The
Company also enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge its net investment position in certain major currencies. Under SFAS No. 133, changes in the fair value of these
instruments are recognized in foreign currency translation adjustment, a component of AOCI, to offset the change in the value of the net investment

being
hedged. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we recorded net gain (loss) in foreign currency translation adjustment of approximately $3 million,
$(40) million and $(8) million, respectively.

        The Company estimates the fair value of its foreign currency derivatives based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market
rates. These amounts are primarily reflected in prepaid expenses and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. 

Summary of AOCI  

        For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we recorded a net gain (loss) to AOCI of approximately $(31) million, $55 million and
$6 million, respectively, net of both income taxes and reclassifications to earnings, primarily related to gains and losses on foreign currency cash flow hedges. These items will generally
offset cash flow gains and losses relating to the underlying exposures being hedged in future periods. The Company estimates that it will reclassify into earnings during the next 12 months
losses of approximately $11 million from the after-tax amount recorded in AOCI as of December 31, 2006, as the anticipated cash flows occur.

        The Company did not discontinue any cash flow hedge relationships during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. 

NOTE 13: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  

        As of December 31, 2006, we were contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties in the amount of approximately
$270 million. These guarantees primarily are related to third-party customers, bottlers and vendors and have arisen through the normal course of business. These guarantees have various terms,
and none of these guarantees was individually significant. The amount represents the maximum potential future payments that we could be required to make under the guarantees; however, we do not
consider it probable that we will be required to satisfy these guarantees. 

        In
December 2003, we granted a $250 million standby line of credit to Coca-Cola FEMSA with normal market terms. This standby line of credit expired in
December 2006. 

        We
believe our exposure to concentrations of credit risk is limited due to the diverse geographic areas covered by our operations. 

97




 


        The
Company is involved in various legal proceedings. We establish reserves for specific legal proceedings when we determine that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and
the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Management has also identified certain other legal matters where we believe an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and/or for which no estimate
of possible losses can be made. Management believes that any liability to the Company that may arise as a result of currently pending legal proceedings, including those discussed below, will not have
a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company taken as a whole. 

        During
the period from 1970 to 1981, our Company owned Aqua-Chem, Inc., now known as Cleaver-Brooks, Inc. ("Aqua-Chem"). A division of
Aqua-Chem manufactured certain boilers that contained gaskets that Aqua-Chem purchased from outside suppliers. Several years after our Company sold this entity,
Aqua-Chem received its first lawsuit relating to asbestos, a component of some of the gaskets. In September 2002, Aqua-Chem notified our Company that it believed we were
obligated for certain costs and expenses associated with its asbestos litigations. Aqua-Chem demanded that our Company reimburse it for approximately $10 million for
out-of-pocket litigation-related expenses. Aqua-Chem also demanded that the Company acknowledge a continuing obligation to Aqua-Chem for any future
liabilities and expenses that are excluded from coverage under the applicable insurance or for which there is no insurance. Our Company disputes Aqua-Chem's claims, and we believe we have
no obligation to Aqua-Chem for any of its past, present or future liabilities, costs or expenses. Furthermore, we believe we have substantial legal and factual defenses to
Aqua-Chem's claims. The parties entered into litigation to resolve this dispute, which was stayed by agreement of the parties pending the outcome of litigation filed in Wisconsin by
certain insurers of Aqua-Chem. In that case, five plaintiff insurance companies filed a declaratory judgment action against Aqua-Chem, the Company and 16 defendant insurance
companies seeking a determination of the parties' rights and liabilities under policies issued by the insurers and reimbursement for amounts paid by plaintiffs in excess of their obligations. That
litigation remains pending, and the Company believes it has substantial legal and factual defenses to the insurers' claims. Aqua-Chem and the Company subsequently reached a settlement
agreement with six of the insurers in the Wisconsin insurance coverage litigation, and those insurers will pay funds into an escrow account for payment of costs arising from the asbestos claims
against Aqua-Chem. Aqua-Chem has also reached a settlement agreement with an additional insurer regarding payment of that insurer's policy proceeds for Aqua-Chem's
asbestos claims. Aqua-Chem and the Company will continue to negotiate with the remaining insurers that are parties to the Wisconsin insurance coverage case and will litigate their claims
against such insurers to the extent negotiations do not result in settlements. The Company also believes Aqua-Chem has substantial insurance coverage to pay Aqua-Chem's
asbestos claimants. 

        The
Company is discussing with the Competition Directorate of the European Commission (the "European Commission") issues relating to parallel trade within the European Union arising out
of comments received by the European Commission from third parties. The Company is cooperating fully with the European Commission and is providing information on these issues and the measures taken
and to be taken to address any issues raised. The Company is unable to predict at this time with any reasonable degree of certainty what action, if any, the European Commission will take with respect
to these issues. 

        At
the time we acquire or divest our interest in an entity, we sometimes agree to indemnify the seller or buyer for specific contingent liabilities. Management believes that any
liability to the Company that may arise as a result of any such indemnification agreements will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company taken as a whole. 

98




 


        The
Company is involved in various tax matters. We establish reserves at the time that we determine it is probable we will be liable to pay additional taxes related to certain matters
and the amounts of such possible additional taxes are reasonably estimable. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and
circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we may have established a reserve, is audited and finally resolved or when a tax
assessment is raised. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any
particular tax matter, we record a reserve when we determine the likelihood of loss is probable and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable. Such liabilities are recorded in the line item accrued
income taxes in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. Favorable resolution of tax matters that had been previously reserved would be recognized as a reduction to our income tax expense, when
known. 

        The
Company is also involved in various tax matters where we have determined that the probability of an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible. Management believes that any liability
to the Company that may arise as a result of currently pending tax matters will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company taken as a whole.

NOTE 15: STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS  

       Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R). Our Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R), using the modified prospective method.
Based on the terms of our plans, our Company did not have a cumulative effect related to its plans. The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) did not have a material impact on our stock-based
compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2006. Further, we believe the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) will not have a material impact on our Company's future stock-based
compensation expense. Prior to 2006, our Company accounted for stock option plans and restricted stock plans under the preferable fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123. 

        Our
total stock-based compensation expense was approximately $324 million, $324 million and $345 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These amounts were
recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the income statement for share-based compensation arrangements
was approximately $93 million, $90 million and $92 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately $376 million of total 

99




 


unrecognized
compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under our plans. This cost is expected to be recognized as stock-based compensation expense over a
weighted-average period of 1.7 years. This expected cost does not include the impact of any future stock-based compensation awards. Additionally, our equity method investees also adopted SFAS
No. 123(R) effective January 1, 2006. Our proportionate share of the stock-based compensation expense resulting from the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) by our equity method investees
is recognized as a reduction to equity income. The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) by our equity method investees did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

        During
2005, the Company changed its estimated service period for retirement-eligible participants in its plans when the terms of their stock-based compensation awards provide for
accelerated vesting upon early retirement. The full-year impact of this change in our estimated service period was approximately $50 million for 2005. 

Stock Option Plans  

        Under our 1991 Stock Option Plan (the "1991 Option Plan"), a maximum of 120 million shares of our common stock was approved to be issued or transferred to
certain officers and employees pursuant to stock options granted under the 1991 Option Plan. Options to purchase common stock under the 1991 Option Plan have been granted to Company employees at fair
market value at the date of grant. 

        The
1999 Stock Option Plan (the "1999 Option Plan") was approved by shareowners in April 1999. Following the approval of the 1999 Option Plan, no grants were made from the 1991
Option Plan, and shares available under the 1991 Option Plan were no longer available to be granted. Under the 1999 Option Plan, a maximum of 120 million shares of our common stock was approved
to be issued or transferred to certain officers and employees pursuant to stock options granted under the 1999 Option Plan. Options to purchase common stock under the 1999 Option Plan have been
granted to Company employees at fair market value at the date of grant. 

        The
2002 Stock Option Plan (the "2002 Option Plan") was approved by shareowners in April 2002. An amendment to the 2002 Option Plan which permitted the issuance of stock
appreciation rights was approved by shareowners in April 2003. Under the 2002 Option Plan, a maximum of 120 million shares of our common stock was approved to be issued or transferred to
certain officers and employees pursuant to stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under the 2002 Option Plan. The stock appreciation rights permit the holder, upon surrendering all or
part of the related stock option, to receive common stock in an amount up to 100 percent of the difference between the market price and the option price. No stock appreciation rights have been
issued under the 2002 Option Plan as of December 31, 2006. Options to purchase common stock under the 2002 Option Plan have been granted to Company employees at fair market value at the date of
grant. 

        Stock
options granted in December 2003 and thereafter generally become exercisable over a four-year annual vesting period and expire 10 years from the date of
grant. Stock options granted from 1999 through July 2003 generally become exercisable over a four-year annual vesting period and expire 15 years from the date of grant. Prior
to 1999, stock options generally became exercisable over a three-year vesting period and expired 10 years from the date of grant. 


        The
fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of the grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. The
expected term of the options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding and is derived by 

100




 


analyzing
historic exercise behavior. Expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities from traded options on the Company's stock, historical volatility of the Company's stock, and other
factors. The risk-free interest rate for the period matching the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. The dividend
yield is the calculated yield on the Company's stock at the time of the grant. 

        The
following table sets forth information about the weighted-average fair value of options granted during the past three years and the weighted-average assumptions used for such grants:

Restricted Stock Award Plans  

        Under the amended 1989 Restricted Stock Award Plan and the amended 1983 Restricted Stock Award Plan (the "Restricted Stock Award Plans"), 40 million and
24 million shares of restricted common stock, respectively, were originally available to be granted to certain officers and key employees of our Company. 

        On
December 31, 2006, approximately 31 million shares remain available for grant under the Restricted Stock Award Plans. Participants are entitled to vote and receive
dividends on the shares and, under the 1983 Restricted Stock Award Plan, participants are reimbursed by our Company for income taxes imposed on the award, but not for taxes generated by the
reimbursement payment. The shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and may be forfeited if a participant leaves our Company for reasons other than retirement, disability or death, absent a
change in control of our Company. 

        The
following awards were outstanding and nonvested as of December 31, 2006: 



•382,700
shares of time-based restricted stock in which the restrictions lapse upon the achievement of continued employment over a specified period of time. An
additional 31,000 shares were promised for employees based outside of the United States;
•416,852
shares of performance-based restricted stock in which restrictions lapse upon the achievement of specific performance goals over a specified performance period; and
•2,271,240
performance share unit ("PSU") awards which could result in a future grant of restricted stock after the achievement of specific performance goals over a specified
performance period. Such awards are subject to adjustment based on the final performance relative to the goals, resulting in a minimum grant of no shares and a maximum grant of 3,370,860 shares.

In 2006, the Company promised to grant an additional 21,000 shares with a grant-date fair value of $48.84 per share to an employee upon retirement. In 2005, the Company promised to grant an additional 10,000 shares to an
employee with a grant-date fair value of $42.84 per share upon completion of three years of service. These awards are similar to time-based restricted stock, including the payment of dividend equivalents, but were granted in this manner because the
employees were based outside of the United States.

The total fair value of time-based restricted shares vested and released during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, was approximately $1.3 million, $4.3 million, and $13.2 million, respectively. The grant date fair
value is the quoted market value of the Company stock on the respective grant date.





        In
the third quarter of 2004, in connection with Douglas N. Daft's retirement, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors released to Mr. Daft 200,000 shares of
restricted stock previously granted to him during the period from April 1992 to October 1998. The weighted average grant-date fair value was $32.26 per share and the total
fair value of shares released was approximately $8.3 million. The terms of these grants provided that the restricted shares be released upon retirement after age 62 but not earlier than five
years from the date of grant. The Compensation Committee determined to release the shares in recognition of Mr. Daft's 27 years of service to the Company and the fact that he would turn
62 in March 2005. Mr. Daft forfeited 500,000 shares of restricted stock granted to him in November 2000, since as of the date of his retirement, he had not held these shares for
five years from the date of grant. In addition, Mr. Daft forfeited 1,000,000 shares of performance-based restricted stock, since Mr. Daft retired prior to the completion of the
performance period. 



 Performance-Based Restricted Stock Awards  



        In 2001, shareowners approved an amendment to the 1989 Restricted Stock Award Plan to allow for the grant of performance-based awards. These awards are released
only upon the achievement of specific measurable performance criteria. These awards pay dividends during the performance period. The majority of awards have specific earnings per share targets for
achievement. If the earnings per share targets are not met, the awards will be cancelled.

1
Represents issuance of restricted stock to executives from conversion of previously granted performance share units due to their retirement during the year. The weighted-average grant-date fair value is based on the fair
values of the performance share unit awards' grant-date fair values.



2

The total fair value of performance-based restricted shares vested and released during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2004, was approximately $2.1 million and $5.0 million, respectively. The grant-date fair value is the quoted
market value of the Company stock on the respective grant date.






 Performance Share Unit Awards  



        In 2003, the Company modified its use of performance-based awards and established a program to grant performance share unit awards under the 1989 Restricted Stock
Award Plan to executives. The number of performance share units earned shall be determined at the end of each performance period, generally three years, based on performance criteria determined by the
Board of Directors and may result in an award of restricted stock for U.S. participants and certain international participants at that time. The restricted stock may be granted to other international
participants shortly before the fifth anniversary of the original award. Restrictions on such stock generally lapse on the fifth anniversary of the original award date. Generally, performance share
unit awards are subject to the performance criteria of compound annual growth in earnings per share over the performance period, as adjusted for certain items approved by the Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors ("adjusted EPS"). The purpose of these adjustments is to ensure a consistent year to year comparison of the specified performance criteria. Performance share units do not pay
dividends during the performance period. Accordingly, the fair value of these units is the quoted market
value of the Company stock on the date of the grant less the present value of the expected dividends not received during the performance period. 


        Performance
share unit Target Awards for the 2004-2006, 2005-2007 and 2006-2008 performance periods require adjusted EPS growth in line with our
Company's internal projections over the performance periods. In the event adjusted EPS exceeds the target projection, additional shares up to the Maximum Award may be granted. In the event adjusted
EPS falls below the target projection, a reduced number of shares as few as the Threshold Award may be granted. If adjusted EPS falls below the Threshold Award performance level, no shares will be
granted. Performance share unit awards provide for cash equivalent payments to former executives who become ineligible for restricted stock grants due to certain events such as death, disability or
termination.

Of
the outstanding granted performance share unit awards as of December 31, 2006, 590,964; 787,576; and 820,700 awards are for the 2004-2006, 2005-2007 and
2006-2008 performance periods, respectively. In addition, 72,000 performance share unit awards, with predefined qualitative performance criteria and release criteria that differ from the
program described above, were granted in 2004 and were outstanding as of December 31, 2006.

compensation expense is recognized over the remaining performance period and is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. 

NOTE 16: PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS  

        Our Company sponsors and/or contributes to pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans covering substantially all U.S. employees. We
also sponsor nonqualified, unfunded defined benefit pension plans for certain associates. In addition, our Company and its subsidiaries have various pension plans and other forms of postretirement
arrangements outside the United States. We use a measurement date of December 31 for substantially all of our pension and postretirement benefit plans.

        The discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates at which the benefit
obligations could be effectively settled. These rates were determined using a cash flow matching technique whereby a hypothetical portfolio of high quality debt securities was constructed that
mirrors the specific benefit obligations for each of our primary U.S. plans. The rate of compensation increase assumption is determined by the Company based upon annual reviews. We review external
data and our own historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate assumptions.

As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, 3 percent of total pension plan assets were invested in common stock of our Company.



2

As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, 6 percent of total pension plan assets were invested in real estate.





        Investment objectives for the Company's U.S. pension plan assets, which comprise 75 percent of total pension plan assets as of
December 31, 2006, are to: 



(1)optimize
the long-term return on plan assets at an acceptable level of risk;
(2)maintain
a broad diversification across asset classes and among investment managers;
(3)maintain
careful control of the risk level within each asset class; and
(4)focus
on a long-term return objective. 

111










<A
NAME="page_ga3053_1_112">  

        Asset
allocation targets promote optimal expected return and volatility characteristics given the long-term time horizon for fulfilling the obligations of the pension plans.
Selection of the targeted asset allocation for U.S. plan assets was based upon a review of the expected return and risk characteristics of each asset class, as well as the correlation of returns among
asset classes. 

        Investment
guidelines are established with each investment manager. These guidelines provide the parameters within which the investment managers agree to operate, including criteria that
determine eligible and ineligible securities, diversification requirements and credit quality standards, where applicable. Unless exceptions have been approved, investment managers are prohibited from
buying or selling commodities, futures or option contracts, as well as from short selling of securities. Furthermore, investment managers agree to obtain written approval for deviations from stated
investment style or guidelines. 

        As
of December 31, 2006, no investment manager was responsible for more than 10 percent of total U.S. plan assets. In addition, diversification requirements for each
investment manager prevent a single security or other investment from exceeding 10 percent, at historical cost, of the individual manager's portfolio. 

        The
expected long-term rate of return assumption for U.S. plan assets is based upon the target asset allocation and is determined using forward-looking assumptions in the
context of historical returns and volatilities for each asset class, as well as correlations among asset classes. We evaluate the rate of return assumption on an annual basis. The expected
long-term rate of return assumption used in computing 2006 net periodic pension cost for the U.S. plans was 8.5 percent. As of December 31, 2006, the 10-year
annualized return on U.S. plan assets was 9.0 percent, the 15-year annualized return was 11.0 percent, and the annualized return since inception was 12.8 percent. 

        Plan
assets for our pension plans outside the United States are insignificant on an individual plan basis. 



 Other Benefit Plans  



        Plan assets associated with other benefits represent funding of the primary U.S. postretirement benefit plans. In late 2006, we established and contributed
$216 million to a U.S. Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association, a tax-qualified trust. As of December 31, 2006, the majority of these funds were held in short-term
investments pending the implementation of long-term asset allocation strategies. While these assets will remain segregated from the primary U.S. pension master trust, the investment
objectives, asset allocation targets and investment guidelines will be determined in a methodology similar to that applied to the U.S. pension plans described above.

The expected benefit payments for our other postretirement benefit plans are net of estimated federal subsidies expected to be received under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.
Federal subsidies are estimated to range from $2 million to $3 million in 2007 to 2011 and are estimated to be $23 million for the period 2012-2016.





Defined Contribution Plans  

        Our Company sponsors a qualified defined contribution plan covering substantially all U.S. employees. Under this plan, we match 100 percent of
participants' contributions up to a maximum of 3 percent of compensation. Company contributions to the U.S. plan were approximately $25 million, $21 million and $18 million
in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We also sponsor defined contribution plans in certain locations outside the United States. Company contributions to those plans were approximately
$18 million, $16 million and $13 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

13
Includes an approximate $36 million (or 0.6 percent) tax benefit related to the favorable resolution of various domestic tax matters.





        Our effective tax rate reflects the tax benefits from having significant operations outside the United States that are taxed at rates lower than
the statutory U.S. rate of 35 percent. During 2006, the Company had several subsidiaries that benefited from various tax incentive grants. The terms of these grants range from 2010 to 2018. The
Company expects each of the grants to be renewed indefinitely. The grants did not have a material effect on the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 or 2004. 

        Undistributed
earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately $7.7 billion at December 31, 2006. Those earnings are considered to be indefinitely
reinvested and, accordingly, no U.S. federal and state income taxes have been provided thereon. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject
to both U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S.
income tax liability is not practical because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation; however, unrecognized foreign tax credits would be available to reduce a portion of the
U.S. tax liability. 

        As
discussed in Note 1, the Jobs Creation Act was enacted in October 2004. One of the provisions provides a one-time benefit related to foreign tax credits
generated by equity investments in prior years. The Company recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $50 million as a result of this law change in 2004. The Jobs Creation Act also
included a temporary incentive for U.S. multinationals to repatriate foreign earnings at an approximate 5.25 percent effective tax rate. During the first quarter of 2005, the Company decided to
repatriate approximately $2.5 billion in previously unremitted foreign earnings. Therefore, the Company recorded a provision for taxes on such previously unremitted foreign earnings of
approximately $152 million in the first quarter of 2005. During 2005, the United States Internal Revenue Service and the United States Department of Treasury issued additional guidance related
to the Jobs Creation Act. As a result of this guidance, the Company reduced the accrued taxes previously provided on such unremitted earnings by $25 million in the second quarter of 2005.
During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company repatriated an additional $3.6 billion, with an associated tax liability of approximately $188 million. Therefore, the total previously
unremitted earnings that were repatriated during the full year of 2005 was $6.1 billion with an associated tax liability of approximately $315 million. This liability was recorded in
2005 as federal and state and local tax expenses in the amount of $301 million and $14 million, respectively.

        As
of December 31, 2006, we had approximately $2,324 million of loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income. Loss carryforwards of approximately
$373 million must be utilized within the next five years; $91 million must be utilized within the next 10 years; and the remainder can be utilized over a period greater than
10 years.

        The Company's deferred tax asset valuation allowances are primarily the result of uncertainties regarding the future realization of recorded tax
benefits on tax loss carryforwards from operations in various jurisdictions. In 2006, the Company recognized a net decrease in its valuation allowances of $108 million. This decrease was
primarily related to the reversal of valuation allowances that covered certain deferred tax assets recorded on capital loss carryforwards. A portion of the capital loss carryforwards was utilized to
offset taxable gains on the sale of a portion of the investments in Coca-Cola Icecek and Coca-Cola FEMSA. In 2005, the Company recognized a decrease in its valuation allowances
of $68 million. This decrease was primarily related to a change in tax rates which resulted in a reduction of certain deferred tax assets and corresponding valuation allowances. In 2004, the
Company recognized an increase in its valuation allowances of $224 million. This increase was primarily related to the recording of a valuation allowance on Germany's net operating losses, the
recording of a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset recorded on the basis difference in an equity investment and a change in the valuation allowance in India. 

NOTE 18: SIGNIFICANT OPERATING AND NONOPERATING ITEMS  

        In 2006, our Company recorded charges of approximately $606 million related to our proportionate share of charges recorded by our equity method investees.
Of this amount, approximately $602 million related to our proportionate share of an impairment charge recorded by CCE for its North American franchise rights. Our proportionate share of CCE's
charges also included approximately $18 million due to restructuring charges recorded by CCE. These charges were partially offset by approximately $33 million related to our
proportionate share of changes in certain of CCE's state and Canadian federal and provincial tax rates. The charges were recorded in the line item equity income—net in the consolidated
statement of income. All of these charges and changes impacted our Bottling Investments operating segment. Refer to Note 3. 

        During
2006, our Company also recorded charges of approximately $112 million, primarily related to the impairment of assets and investments in our bottling operations,
approximately $53 million for contract termination costs related to production capacity efficiencies and approximately $24 million related to other restructuring costs. These charges
impacted the Africa, the East, South Asia and Pacific Rim, the European Union, the North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East, the Bottling Investments and the Corporate operating segments. None of these
charges was individually significant. Approximately $4 million of these charges were recorded in the line item cost of goods sold and approximately $185 million of these charges were
recorded in the line item other operating charges in the consolidated statement of income. Refer to Note 20. 

117




 


        The
Company made a $100 million donation to The Coca-Cola Foundation in 2006, which resulted in a charge to the consolidated statement of income line item selling,
general and administrative expenses and impacted the Corporate operating segment. 

        In
2006, the Company sold a portion of its Coca-Cola FEMSA shares to FEMSA and recorded a pretax gain of approximately $175 million to the consolidated statement of
income line item other income (loss)—net, which impacted the Corporate operating segment. Refer to Note 3. 

        The
Company sold a portion of our investment in Coca-Cola Icecek in an initial public offering in 2006. Our Company received net cash proceeds of approximately
$198 million and realized a pretax gain of approximately $123 million, which was recorded as other income (loss)—net in the consolidated statement of income and impacted the
Corporate operating segment. Refer to Note 3. 

        In
2005, our Company received approximately $109 million related to the settlement of a class action lawsuit concerning price-fixing in the sale of HFCS purchased by the Company
during the years 1991 to 1995. Subsequent to the receipt of this settlement amount, the Company distributed approximately $62 million to certain bottlers in North America. From 1991 to 1995,
the Company purchased HFCS on behalf of these bottlers. Therefore, these bottlers were ultimately entitled to a portion of the proceeds of the settlement. Of the approximately $62 million we
distributed to certain bottlers in North America, approximately $49 million was distributed to CCE. The Company's remaining share of the settlement was approximately $47 million, which
was recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold and impacted the Corporate operating segment. 

        During
2005, we recorded approximately $23 million of noncash pretax gains on the issuances of stock by equity method investees. Refer to Note 4. 

        The
Company recorded approximately $50 million of expense in 2005 as a result of a change in our estimated service period for the acceleration of certain stock-based compensation
awards. Refer to Note 15. 

        Equity
income in 2005 was reduced by approximately $33 million for the Bottling Investments operating segment, primarily related to our proportionate share of the tax liability
recorded by CCE resulting from its repatriation of previously unremitted foreign earnings under the Jobs Creation Act, as well as our proportionate share of restructuring charges. Those amounts were
partially offset by our proportionate share of CCE's HFCS lawsuit settlement proceeds and changes in certain of CCE's state and provincial tax rates. Refer to Note 3. 

        Our
Company recorded impairment charges during 2005 of approximately $84 million related to certain trademarks for beverages sold in the Philippines and approximately
$1 million related to impairment of other assets. These impairment charges were recorded in the consolidated statement of income line item other operating charges. 

        During
2004, our Company's equity income benefited by approximately $37 million for our proportionate share of a favorable tax settlement related to Coca-Cola FEMSA.
Refer to Note 3. 

        In
2004, we recorded approximately $24 million of noncash pretax gains on the issuances of stock by CCE. Refer to Note 4. 

        We
recorded impairment charges during 2004 of approximately $374 million, primarily related to the impairment of franchise rights at CCEAG and approximately $18 million
related to other assets. These impairment charges were recorded in the consolidated statement of income line item other operating charges. 

118




 


        We
recorded additional impairment charges in 2004 of approximately $88 million. These impairments primarily related to the write-downs of certain manufacturing investments and an
intangible asset. As a result of operating losses, management prepared analyses of cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. Because the sum of the
undiscounted cash flows was less than the carrying value of such assets, we recorded an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the assets to fair value. These impairment charges were
recorded in the consolidated statement of income line item other operating charges. 

        Also
in 2004, our Company received a $75 million insurance settlement related to the class action lawsuit that was settled in 2000. The Company donated $75 million to The
Coca-Cola Foundation in 2004. 


NOTE 19: ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS  

        In December 2006, the Company entered into a purchase agreement with San Miguel Corporation and two of its subsidiaries (collectively, "SMC") to acquire
all of the shares of capital stock of Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc. ("CCBPI") held by SMC, representing 65 percent of all the issued and outstanding capital stock of
CCBPI. CCBPI is the Company's authorized bottler in the Philippines. The transaction is subject to certain conditions. Upon the closing of this transaction, the Company will own 100 percent of
the issued and outstanding capital stock of CCBPI. The total purchase price is expected to be approximately $590 million, subject to adjustment based on the terms and conditions of the purchase
agreement. The results of operations of CCBPI will be included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the closing. 

        In
December 2006, the Company and Coca-Cola FEMSA entered into an agreement to jointly acquire Jugos del Valle, S.A.B. de C.V., the second largest producer of packaged
juices, nectars and fruit-flavored beverages in Mexico and the largest producer of such beverages in Brazil. The total purchase price is expected to be approximately $380 million in cash plus
the assumption of approximately $90 million in debt. The transaction is subject to certain conditions, including required regulatory approvals. 

        During
2006, our Company's acquisition and investment activity, including the acquisition of trademarks, totaled approximately $901 million. In the third quarter of 2006, our
Company acquired a controlling shareholding interest in Kerry Beverages Limited ("KBL"). KBL was formed by the Company and the Kerry Group in 1993 and has a majority ownership in 11
joint ventures that manufacture and distribute Company products across nine provinces in China. KBL also has a minority interest in the joint venture bottler in Beijing. Subsequent to the acquisition,
the Company changed KBL's name to Coca-Cola China Industries Limited ("CCCIL"). As a result of the transaction, the Company owns 89.5 percent of the outstanding
shares of CCCIL, and we have agreed to purchase the remaining 10.5 percent by the end of 2008 at the same price per share as the initial purchase price plus interest. We have all voting and
economic rights over the remaining shares. This transaction was accounted for as a business combination, and the results of CCCIL's operations have been included in the Company's
consolidated financial statements since August 29, 2006. CCCIL is included in the Bottling Investments operating segment. 

        In
the third quarter of 2006, our Company signed agreements with J. Bruce Llewellyn and Brucephil, Inc. ("Brucephil"), the parent company of The Philadelphia Coca-Cola
Bottling Company, for the potential purchase of the remaining shares of Brucephil not currently owned by the Company. The agreements provide for the Company's purchase of the shares upon the election
of Mr. Llewellyn or the election of the Company. Based on the terms of these agreements, the Company concluded that it must consolidate Brucephil under Interpretation No. 46(R).
Brucephil's financial statements were consolidated effective September 29, 2006. Brucephil is included in our Bottling Investments operating segment. 

119




 


        Also
in the third quarter of 2006, our Company acquired Apollinaris GmbH ("Apollinaris"). Apollinaris has been selling sparkling and still mineral water in Germany since 1862. This
transaction was accounted for as a business combination, and the results of Apollinaris' operations have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements since July 1, 2006. A
portion of Apollinaris' business is included in the European Union operating segment, and the balance is included in the Bottling Investments operating segment. 

        The
combined amount paid or to be paid to complete these third-quarter 2006 transactions totals approximately $707 million. As a result of these transactions, the Company recorded
approximately $707 million of franchise rights, approximately $74 million of trademarks and $182 million of goodwill. These amounts reflect a preliminary allocation of the
purchase price of the applicable transactions and are subject to refinement. The franchise rights and trademarks have been assigned an indefinite life. 


        In
January 2006, our Company acquired a 100 percent interest in TJC Holdings (Pty) Ltd. ("TJC"), a bottling company in South Africa, from Chef Limited and Tom Cook
Trust for cash consideration of approximately $200 million. This transaction was accounted for as a business combination, with the results of TJC included in the Company's consolidated
financial statements since the date of acquisition. TJC is included in our Bottling Investments operating segment. The Company allocated the purchase price, based on estimated fair values, to all of
the assets and liabilities that we acquired. The amount of the purchase price allocated to property, plant and equipment was approximately $21 million, franchise rights was approximately
$169 million and goodwill was approximately $59 million. The franchise rights have been assigned an indefinite life. 


        Assuming
the results of these businesses had been included in operations beginning on January 1, 2006, pro forma financial data would not be required due to immateriality. 

        During
2005, our Company's acquisition and investment activity totaled approximately $637 million and included the acquisition of the German bottling company Bremer
Erfrischungsgetraenke GmbH ("Bremer") for approximately $160 million from InBev SA. This transaction was accounted for as a business combination, and the results of Bremer's operations have
been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements beginning in September 2005. The Company recorded approximately $54 million of property, plant and equipment,
approximately $85 million of franchise rights and approximately $58 million of goodwill related to this acquisition. The franchise rights have been assigned an indefinite life, and the
goodwill was allocated to the Germany and Nordic reporting unit within the European Union operating segment. 

        In
August 2005, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 49 percent interest in the business of CCDA Waters L.L.C. ("CCDA") not previously owned by our Company. Our
Company and Danone Waters of North America, Inc. ("DWNA") had formed CCDA in July 2002 for the production, marketing and distribution of DWNA's bottled spring and source water business
in the United States. This transaction was accounted for as a business combination, and the consolidated results of CCDA's operations have been included in the Company's consolidated financial
statements since July 2002. CCDA is included in our North
America operating segment. In July 2005, the Company acquired Sucos Mais, a Brazilian juice company. The results of Sucos Mais have been included in our consolidated financial statements since
July 2005. 

        Assuming
the results of these businesses had been included in operations beginning on January 1, 2005, pro forma financial data would not be required due to immateriality. 


        On
April 20, 2005, our Company and Coca-Cola HBC jointly acquired Multon for a total purchase price of approximately $501 million, split equally between the
Company and Coca-Cola HBC. The Company's 

120




 


investment
in Multon is accounted for under the equity method. Equity income—net includes our proportionate share of the results of Multon's operations beginning April 20, 2005. 


        During
2004, our Company's acquisition and investment activity totaled approximately $267 million, primarily related to the purchase of trademarks, brands and related contractual
rights in Latin America, none of which was individually significant. 

NOTE 20: OPERATING SEGMENTS  

        During 2006, the Company made certain changes to its operating structure, primarily to establish a separate internal organization for its consolidated bottling
operations and its unconsolidated bottling investments. This structure resulted in the reporting of a Bottling Investments operating segment, along with the six existing geographic operating segments
and Corporate, beginning with the first quarter of 2006. Prior to this change in the operating structure, the financial results of the consolidated bottling operations and our proportionate share of
the earnings of unconsolidated bottling operations had been generally included in the geographic operating segments in which they conducted business. As of December 31, 2006, our Company's
operating structure consisted of the following operating segments: Africa; East, South Asia and Pacific Rim; European Union; Latin America; North America; North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East; Bottling
Investments; and Corporate. Prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the new operating structure described above. 


Segment Products and Services  

        The business of our Company is nonalcoholic beverages. Our operating segments derive a majority of their revenues from the manufacture and sale of beverage
concentrates and syrups and, in some cases, the sale of finished beverages. 

Method of Determining Segment Income or Loss  

        Management evaluates the performance of our operating segments separately to individually monitor the different factors affecting financial performance. Our
Company manages income taxes and financial costs, such as interest income and expense, on a global basis within the Corporate operating segment. We evaluate segment performance based on income or loss
before income taxes.

    REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  The Coca-Cola Company and Subsidiaries        

        Management of the Company is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the consolidated financial statements appearing in our annual report on
Form 10-K. The financial statements were prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles appropriate in the circumstances and, accordingly, include certain
amounts based on our best judgments and estimates. Financial information in this annual report on Form 10-K is consistent with that in the financial statements. 


        Management
of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act"). The Company's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Our internal control over financial reporting is supported by a program of internal audits and appropriate reviews by
management, written policies and guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified personnel and a written Code of Business Conduct adopted by our Company's Board of Directors, applicable to all
Company Directors and all officers and employees of our Company and subsidiaries. 


        Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and even when determined to be effective, can only provide
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

        The
Audit Committee of our Company's Board of Directors, composed solely of Directors who are independent in accordance with the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange listing
standards, the Exchange Act and the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, meets with the independent auditors, management and internal auditors periodically to discuss internal control over
financial reporting and auditing and financial reporting matters. The Audit Committee reviews with the independent auditors the scope and results of the audit effort. The Audit Committee also meets
periodically with the independent auditors and the chief internal auditor without management present to ensure that the independent auditors and the chief internal auditor have free access to the
Audit Committee. Our Audit Committee's Report can be found in the Company's 2007 Proxy statement. 

        Management
assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006. In making this assessment, management used the criteria
set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework. During
2006, the Company acquired Kerry Beverages Limited (subsequently renamed Coca-Cola China Industries Limited), Apollinaris GmbH and TJC Holdings (Pty) Ltd. and began consolidating
the operations of Brucephil, Inc. Refer to Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these events. Management has excluded these
businesses from its evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006. The net operating revenues attributable to these
businesses represented approximately 1.6 percent of the Company's consolidated net operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006, and their aggregate total assets represented
approximately 6.1 percent of the Company's consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2006. Based on our assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006. 

        The
Company's independent auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, a registered public accounting firm, are appointed by the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors, subject to
ratification by our Company's shareowners. Ernst & Young LLP have audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of The Coca-Cola Company and subsidiaries,
management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting and the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The reports of
the independent auditors are contained in this annual report.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm        

Board of Directors and Shareowners  The Coca-Cola Company  

        We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Coca-Cola Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and
the related consolidated statements of income, shareowners' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 


        We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

        In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of The Coca-Cola Company and
subsidiaries at December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

        As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2006 the Company adopted SFAS No. 158 related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. 

        We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of The Coca-Cola Company and
subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 20, 2007, expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.

    Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting        

Board of Directors and Shareowners  The Coca-Cola Company  

        We have audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that The
Coca-Cola Company and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in  Internal Control—Integrated Framework<FONT
SIZE=2> issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
The Coca-Cola Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit. 

        We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

        A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

        Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

        As
indicated in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management's assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Kerry Beverages Limited (subsequently renamed Coca-Cola China Industries Limited), Brucephil, Inc., Apollinaris
GmbH and TJC Holdings (Pty) Ltd. which are included in the 2006 consolidated financial statements of The Coca-Cola Company and subsidiaries and constituted approximately
6.1 percent of the Company's consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2006 and approximately 1.6 percent of the Company's consolidated net operating revenues for the year then
ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of The Coca-Cola Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Kerry
Beverages Limited (subsequently renamed Coca-Cola China Industries Limited), Brucephil, Inc., Apollinaris GmbH and TJC Holdings (Pty) Ltd. 

        In
our opinion, management's assessment that The Coca-Cola Company and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, The Coca-Cola Company and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the COSO criteria. 


        We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of The Coca-Cola
Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareowners' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2006, and our report dated February 20, 2007, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES        

        The Company, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, evaluated
the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the "Exchange Act")) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely making known to them material information relating to the Company and the Company's consolidated subsidiaries required to be disclosed in the
Company's reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act. 

        The
report called for by Item 308(a) of Regulation S-K is incorporated herein by reference to Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,
included in Part II, "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this report. During 2006, the Company acquired Kerry Beverages Limited (subsequently renamed Coca-Cola
China Industries Limited), Apollinaris GmbH and TJC Holdings (Pty) Ltd. and began consolidating the operations of Brucephil, Inc. Refer to Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information regarding these events. Management has excluded these businesses from its evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2006. The net operating revenues attributable to these businesses represented approximately 1.6 percent of the Company's consolidated net operating
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006, and their aggregate total assets represented approximately 6.1 percent of the Company's consolidated total assets as of December 31,
2006. 

        The
attestation report called for by Item 308(b) of Regulation S-K is incorporated herein by reference to Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, included in Part II, "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this report.

has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2006 that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
