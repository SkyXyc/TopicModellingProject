Item 1A. RISK FACTORSThe risks described in this Form 10-K are not the only risks we face. Additional risks that are not presently known or that we presently deem to be immaterial also could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, business, and prospects.Our framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to us. Our risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to us. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which we are subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, operational risk, legal and compliance risk, and reputational risk, among others. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified. For example, the recent financial and credit crisis and resulting regulatory reform highlighted both the importance and some of the limitations of managing unanticipated risks. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.As one of the largest lenders in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic U.S. and a provider of financial products and services to consumers and businesses across the U.S., our financial results have been, and may continue to be, materially affected by general economic conditions, particularly unemployment levels and home prices in the U.S., and a deterioration of economic conditions or of the financial markets may materially adversely affect our lending and other businesses and our financial results and condition.We generate revenue from the interest and fees we charge on the loans and other products and services we sell, and a substantial amount of our revenue and earnings comes from the net interest income and fee income that we earn from our consumer and wholesale banking businesses, including our mortgage banking business. These businesses have been, and may continue to be, materially affected by the state of the U.S. economy, particularly unemployment levels and home prices. Although the U.S. economy has continued to gradually improve from the severely depressed levels of 2008 and early 2009, economic growth has been slow and improvement in the housing market has been modest. In addition, financial uncertainty stemming from the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and U.S. debt and budget matters, including the "fiscal cliff," raising of the debt limit, deficit reduction, and the downgrade of U.S. debt ratings, as well as other recent events and concerns such as the political unrest in the Middle East, the increased volatility of commodity prices, and the uncertainty surrounding financial regulatory reform and its effect on the revenues of financial services companies such as us, have impacted and may continue to impact the continuing global economic recovery. A prolonged period of slow growth in the U.S. economy or any deterioration in general economic conditions and/or the financial markets resulting from the above matters or any other events or factors that may disrupt or dampen the global economic recovery could materially adversely affect our financial results and condition. The high unemployment rate in the U.S., together with elevated levels of distressed property sales and the persistent weak home prices across the U.S., including in many of our large banking markets such as Florida, may be causing consumers to delay home purchases and has resulted in elevated credit costs and nonperforming asset levels which have adversely affected our credit performance and our financial results and condition. If unemployment levels do not improve or if home prices decrease further we would expect to incur higher than normal charge-offs and provision expense from increases in our allowance for credit losses. These conditions may adversely affect not only consumer loan performance but also commercial and CRE loans, especially for those business borrowers that rely on the health of industries or properties that may experience deteriorating economic conditions. The ability of these borrowers to repay their loans may be reduced, causing us to incur significantly higher credit losses. In addition, current economic conditions have made it more challenging for us to increase our consumer and commercial loan portfolios by making loans to creditworthy borrowers at attractive yields. Although we have significant capacity to add loans to our balance sheet, loan demand has been soft resulting in our retaining a much higher amount of lower yielding liquid assets on our balance sheet. If economic conditions do not continue to improve or if the economy worsens and unemployment rises, which would likely result in a decrease in consumer and business confidence and spending, the demand for our credit products, including our mortgages, may fall, which would adversely affect our interest and fee income and our earnings. A deterioration in business and economic conditions that erodes consumer and investor confidence levels, and/or increased volatility of financial markets, also could adversely affect financial results for our fee-based businesses, including our wealth management, investment advisory, and investment banking businesses. We earn fee income from managing assets for others and providing brokerage and other investment advisory and wealth management services. Because investment management fees are often based on the value of assets under management, a decrease in the market prices of those assets could reduce our fee income. Changes in stock market prices could affect the trading activity of investors, reducing commissions and other 8fees we earn from our brokerage business. Poor economic conditions and volatile or unstable financial markets also can adversely affect our debt and equity underwriting and advisory businesses.Legislation and regulation, including the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as future legislation and/or regulation, could require us to change certain of our business practices, reduce our revenue, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise adversely affect our business operations and/or competitive position. We are subject to significant regulation under state and federal laws in the U.S.  Economic, financial, market, and political conditions during the past few years have led to significant new legislation and regulation in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions outside of the U.S. where we conduct business. These laws and regulations may affect the manner in which we do business and the products and services that we provide, affect or restrict our ability to compete in our current businesses or our ability to enter into or acquire new businesses, reduce or limit our revenue in businesses or impose additional fees, assessments or taxes on us, intensify the regulatory supervision of us and the financial services industry, and adversely affect our business operations or have other negative consequences. For example, in 2009 several legislative and regulatory initiatives were adopted that will have an impact on our businesses and financial results, including FRB amendments to Regulation E which, among other things, affect the way we may charge overdraft fees. In third quarter 2009, we also implemented policy changes to help customers limit overdraft and returned item fees. The impact on our revenue of the Regulation E amendments, as well as our policy changes, reduced our fee revenue. The continuing impact on our future revenue could vary materially due to a variety of factors, including changes in customer behavior, economic conditions and other potential offsetting factors. On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act became law. The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, (i) established a new Financial Stability Oversight Council to monitor systemic risk posed by financial firms and imposes additional and enhanced FRB regulations, including capital and liquidity requirements, on certain large, interconnected bank holding companies and systemically significant nonbanking firms intended to promote financial stability which has substantial resolution authority that may affect or alter the rights of creditors and investors in a resolution scenario; (ii) created a liquidation framework for the resolution of covered financial companies, the costs of which would be paid through assessments on surviving covered financial companies; (iii) made significant changes to the structure of bank and bank holding company regulation and activities in a variety of areas, including prohibiting proprietary trading and private fund activities, subject to certain exceptions; (iv) created a new framework for the regulation of OTC derivatives and new regulations for the securitization market and strengthens the regulatory oversight of securities and capital markets by the SEC; (v) established the CFPB, which will have sweeping powers to administer and enforce a new federal regulatory framework of consumer financial regulation; (vi) provided for increased regulation of residential mortgage activities; (vii) revised the FDIC's assessment base for deposit insurance by changing from an assessment base defined by deposit liabilities to a risk-based system based on consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity; and (vii) authorized the FRB under the Durbin Amendment to issue regulations establishing, among other things, standards for assessing whether debit card interchange fees received by debit card issuers are reasonable and proportional to the costs incurred by issuers for electronic debit transactions. Many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act became effective in July 2010, and additional provisions became effective upon the first anniversary of its enactment, July 21, 2011. However, a number of these and other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act still require extensive rulemaking, guidance, and interpretation by regulatory authorities and have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates. Accordingly, in many respects the ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and its effects on the U.S. financial system and us will not be known for an extended period of time. Nevertheless, the Dodd-Frank Act, including current and future rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those rules, could result in a loss of revenue, require us to change certain of our business practices, limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, increase our capital requirements and impose additional assessments and costs on us and otherwise adversely affect our business operations and have other negative consequences. For example, on October 1, 2011, final rules became effective which limit the fees we can charge for debit card interchange, and this has reduced our noninterest income. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB with jurisdiction to regulate, among other things, unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. The CFPB has already imposed substantial fines on other financial institutions. Further, the CFPB is expected to release seven new final regulations under Title XIV of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2013 further regulating the origination of mortgages and addressing "ability to repay" standards, loan officer compensation, appraisal disclosures, HOEPA triggers and other matters. The "ability to repay" rule, in particular has the potential to significantly affect our business since it provides a borrower with a defense to foreclosure unless the lender established the borrower's ability to repay, or that the loan was a "qualified mortgage" or met other exceptions to the rule. Our business strategy, product offerings, and profitability may change as these rules are developed, become effective, and are interpreted by the regulators and courts.The Dodd-Frank Act (through provisions commonly known as the “Volcker Rule”) prohibits banks from engaging in some types of proprietary trading and restricts the ability of banks to sponsor or invest in private equity or hedge funds. The Volcker Rule became effective on July 21, 2012 in advance of the finalization of the implementing regulations by the relevant regulatory 9agencies. These regulatory agencies issued guidance that during the automatic two year conformance period commencing on July 21, 2012, banking entities should engage in good-faith planning efforts to enable them to comply with the Volcker Rule and any final implementing regulations by no later than the end of this two year period, which may include complying with any reporting and recordkeeping requirements before the end of this two year period if they are included in and required by the final regulations.  They also clarified that these good-faith efforts should include an assessment of which banking entity activities are covered by the Volcker Rule and any final implementing regulations and development of a plan to conform these activities to the Volcker Rule/final implementing regulations by July 21, 2014 unless an extension is provided. We have undertaken such good faith planning efforts.Although we do not have a designated proprietary trading operation, the scope of the proprietary trading prohibition and its impact on us will depend on definitions in the final rule, particularly those definitions related to statutory exemptions for market making, hedging activities and customer trading. Until more is known regarding these definitions and the other provisions of the implementing rules, we cannot determine the impact of the proprietary trading prohibition, although we expect that any meaningful limitation on our ability to hedge our risks in the ordinary course or to trade on behalf of customers or conduct related market making activities would adversely affect our business and results of operations. During the course of 2012, we disposed of substantially all of our holdings of our interests in private equity and hedge funds which we expect to be affected by the Volcker Rule. The Dodd-Frank Act created a new regulatory framework for the U.S. OTC derivatives markets with jurisdiction being broadly shared by the CFTC for swaps and the SEC for security-based swaps. In 2012, the CFTC finalized many of its core regulations triggering a phased-in compliance period commencing in late 2012 and most of 2013. While the SEC has proposed most of its core regulations, most of its new requirements await final regulations. Although the ultimate impact will depend on the final regulations, we expect that our derivatives business will be subject to new substantive requirements, including registration with the CFTC and/or the SEC, margin requirements in excess of current market practice, capital requirements specific to this business, trade reporting and robust record keeping requirements, business conduct requirements (including daily valuations, disclosure of material risks associated with swaps and disclosure of material incentives and conflicts of interest), and mandatory clearing and exchange trading of all standardized swaps designated by the relevant regulatory agencies as required to be cleared. These requirements collectively will impose implementation and ongoing compliance burdens on us and will introduce additional legal risk (including as a result of newly applicable antifraud and antimanipulation provisions and private rights of action).In addition, the relevant regulatory agencies have proposed rules to implement the Dodd-Frank Act provisions requiring retention of risk by certain securitization participants through holding interests in the securitization vehicles, but the rules are not yet finalized or effective. As a result, the ultimate impact of these Dodd-Frank Act provisions on us remains unpredictable. The impact on us could be direct, by requiring us to hold interests in a securitization vehicle or other assets that represent a portion of the credit risk held by the securitization vehicle, or indirect, by impacting markets in which we participate. Since the beginning of the financial crisis, there has been and continues to be substantially less private (that is, non-government backed) securitization activity than had previously been the case. It is unclear at present whether and to what extent the private securitization markets will rebound. In recent years we have only engaged to a limited extent in securitization transactions under circumstances where we might expect to be required to retain additional risk on our balance sheet as a result of implementation of these Dodd-Frank Act provisions. If the market for private securitizations rebounds and we decide to increase our participation in that market, we would likely be required under the regulations to retain more risk than would otherwise have been the case, with currently uncertain financial impact. In addition, other securitization reforms mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act or implemented or proposed by the SEC may have the effect of limiting our ability to execute, or increase the cost of, securitization transactions. The impact of such reforms on our business is uncertain and difficult to quantify.In February 2011, the White House delivered a report to Congress regarding proposals to reform the housing finance market in the U.S. The report, among other things, outlined various potential proposals to wind down the GSEs and reduce or eliminate over time the role of the GSEs in guaranteeing mortgages and providing funding for mortgage loans, as well as proposals to implement reforms relating to borrowers, lenders, and investors in the mortgage market, including reducing the maximum size of a loan that the GSEs can guarantee, phasing in a minimum down payment requirement for borrowers, improving underwriting standards, and increasing accountability and transparency in the securitization process. The extent and timing of any regulatory reform regarding the GSEs and the home mortgage market, as well as any effect on our business and financial results, are uncertain. Any other future legislation and/or regulation, if adopted, also could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, income, and/or competitive position and may have other negative consequences. For additional information, see the “Government Supervision and Regulation” section in this Form 10-K.10We are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines and, if we fail to meet these guidelines, our financial condition would be adversely affected.Under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements, we, together with our banking subsidiary and broker-dealer subsidiaries, must meet guidelines subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. From time to time, the regulators implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy guidelines. The proposed rulemakings conforming U.S. regulatory capital to Basel III described in Item 1 under “Government Supervision and Regulation,” when implemented by the U.S. banking agencies and fully phased-in, will result in higher and more stringent capital requirements for us and our banking subsidiary. In particular, the proposed rulemakings will require us to maintain a minimum ratio of Tier 1 common equity to RWA of at least 7.0% when fully phased-in. Under the NPR published by the Federal Reserve and other regulators in June, 2012, the risk weighting of many of our assets will change. We have estimated our regulatory capital under Basel III under the NPR, and we provide that estimate and a reconcilement to U.S. GAAP in Table 39, "Reconcilement of Non-U.S. GAAP Measures" in Item 7, "MD&A", in this Form 10-K. Note that this estimate is consistent with our interpretation of the NPR, and ambiguities in the NPR or other interpretations of the NPR could result in a larger measure of risk-weighted assets and consequently a lower Tier 1 common equity ratio. If risk weightings of certain assets change, and we are required to hold increased amounts of capital as a result of holding those assets, the profitability of those assets and businesses may change, and longer-term this may result in changes in our business mix. The NPR will also eventually eliminate the contribution to Tier 1 Capital of certain trust preferred and certain other hybrid debt securities currently included in Tier 1 capital. These securities will lose Tier 1 Capital status under phased-in approach between 2013 and 2016. At December 31, 2012, we had $627 million principal amount of such securities outstanding. Additionally, the Basel III framework requires banks and bank holding companies to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests, including a LCR, which is designed to ensure that the banking entity maintains a level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets greater than or equal to the entity's expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon under an acute liquidity stress scenario, and a NSFR, designed to promote more medium and long-term funding based on the liquidity characteristics of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one-year time horizon. If we are not able to meet these minimum liquidity capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements, we may need to alter our investment portfolio or business mix, and this may adversely affect our earnings. Banks will be required to become compliant with the LCR during a phase-in period beginning January 1, 2015. At this time, international regulatory authorities are still assessing the NSFR and it is unclear when the NSFR will be introduced as a requirement.In 2010, the FRB issued guidelines for evaluating proposals by large bank holding companies, including us. Pursuant to those FRB guidelines and the Dodd-Frank Act requirements, we annually submit a capital plan to the FRB under the FRB's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review program (CCAR), which incorporates requirements from Sections 165(i)(1) and (2) of the Dodd Frank Act. Consistent with these guidelines and the FRB's existing supervisory guidance regarding internal capital assessment, planning and adequacy, the FRB has adopted rules that require large bank holding companies, such as us, to submit annual capital plans to the FRB and to provide prior notice to the FRB before making a capital distribution under certain circumstances, including if the FRB objected to a capital plan or if certain minimum capital requirements were not maintained. Further, our capital planning under CCAR requires an analysis of capital management and capital adequacy under a variety of hypothetical stressed economic scenarios. There can be no assurance that the FRB will respond favorably to our pending and future capital plan reviews. Further, in December, 2011, the FRB proposed rules under the Dodd-Frank Act that will impose enhanced prudential standards on large bank holding companies such as us, including enhanced capital and liquidity requirements, which may be similar to or more restrictive than those proposed by the BCBS.The performance of the Company under CCAR's hypothetical scenarios dictates the capital actions the FRB will allow us to take, such as dividends and share repurchases. In addition to the quantitative requirements of CCAR, the FRB also evaluates the qualitative aspects of our capital management program, which can also impact our capital actions. Due to the importance and intensity of the CCAR process, we have dedicated additional resources to comply with CCAR, although no assurance can be provided that these resources will be deemed sufficient or that we will be deemed to have adequate capital under CCAR's hypothetical scenarios. If we are deemed to have inadequate capital under CCAR's hypothetical scenarios, then the FRB may prohibit us from taking certain capital actions, such as paying or increasing dividends or repurchasing capital stock.The Basel standards and FRB regulatory capital and liquidity requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including common stock dividends and stock repurchases, and may require us to increase our capital and/or liquidity. Any requirement that we increase our regulatory capital, replace certain capital instruments which presently qualify as Tier 1 capital, increase regulatory capital ratios or liquidity could require us to liquidate assets or otherwise change our business and/or investment plans, which may adversely affect our financial results. Although not currently anticipated, the proposed Basel capital rules and/or our regulators may require us to raise additional capital in the future. Issuing additional common stock would dilute the ownership of existing stockholders. Further, even if the FRB approves a capital plan which we submit 11under CCAR, such approval would not mean that other limitations do not exist on our ability to pay or increase dividends or repurchase stock.The need to maintain more capital and greater liquidity than historically has been required could limit our business activities, including lending, and our ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions. It could also result in us taking steps to increase our capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit our ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders. In addition, the new liquidity standards could require us to increase our holdings of highly liquid short-term investments, thereby reducing our ability to invest in longer-term assets even if more desirable from a balance sheet management perspective. Moreover, although these new requirements are being phased in over time, U.S. federal banking agencies have been taking into account expectations regarding the ability of banks to meet these new requirements, including under stressed conditions, in approving actions that represent uses of capital, such as dividend increases and acquisitions.Loss of customer deposits and market illiquidity could increase our funding costs. We rely heavily on bank deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding for the loans we make. We compete with banks and other financial services companies for deposits. If our competitors raise the rates they pay on deposits our funding costs may increase, either because we raise our rates to avoid losing deposits or because we lose deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of funding. Higher funding costs reduce our net interest margin and net interest income. We rely on the mortgage secondary market and GSEs for some of our liquidity.We sell most of the mortgage loans we originate in order to reduce our credit risk and provide funding for additional loans. We rely on GSEs to purchase loans that meet their conforming loan requirements and on other capital markets investors to purchase loans that do not meet those requirements–referred to as “nonconforming” loans. Since 2007, investor demand for nonconforming loans has fallen sharply, increasing credit spreads and reducing the liquidity for those loans. In response to the reduced liquidity in the capital markets, we may retain more nonconforming loans negatively impacting reserves, or we may originate less negatively impacting revenue. When we retain a loan not only do we keep the credit risk of the loan but we also do not receive any sale proceeds that could be used to generate new loans. Continued lack of liquidity could limit our ability to fund–and thus originate–new mortgage loans, reducing the fees we earn from originating and servicing loans. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that GSEs will not materially limit their purchases of conforming loans due to capital constraints or change their criteria for conforming loans (e.g., maximum loan amount or borrower eligibility). As previously noted, proposals have been presented to reform the housing finance market in the U.S., including the role of the GSEs in the housing finance market. The extent and timing of any such regulatory reform regarding the housing finance market and the GSEs, as well as any effect on our business and financial results, are uncertain. We are subject to credit risk.When we loan money, commit to loan money or enter into a letter of credit or other contract with a counterparty, we incur credit risk, which is the risk of losses if our borrowers do not repay their loans or our counterparties fail to perform according to the terms of their contracts. A number of our products expose us to credit risk, including loans, leases and lending commitments, derivatives, trading assets, insurance arrangements with respect to such products, and assets held for sale. As one of the nation's largest lenders, the credit quality of our portfolio can have a significant impact on our earnings. We estimate and establish reserves for credit risks and credit losses inherent in our credit exposure (including unfunded credit commitments). This process, which is critical to our financial results and condition, requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions and how these economic predictions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. As is the case with any such assessments, there is always the chance that we will fail to identify the proper factors or that we will fail to accurately estimate the impacts of factors that we do identify.We might underestimate the credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio and have credit losses in excess of the amount reserved. We might increase the allowance because of changing economic conditions, including falling home prices and higher unemployment, or other factors such as changes in borrower behavior. As an example, borrowers may discontinue making payments on their real estate-secured loans if the value of the real estate is less than what they owe, even if they are still financially able to make the payments. While we believe that our allowance for credit losses was adequate at December 31, 2012, there is no assurance that it will be sufficient to cover all incurred credit losses, especially if housing and employment conditions worsen. In the event of significant deterioration in economic conditions, we may be required to increase reserves in future periods, which would reduce our earnings. For additional information, see the “Risk Management–Credit Risk Management” and “Critical Accounting Policies–Allowance for Credit Losses” sections in the MD&A in this Form 10-K.12Our ALLL may not be adequate to cover our eventual losses.Like other financial institutions, we maintain an ALLL to provide for loan defaults and nonperformance. Our ALLL is based on our historical loss experience, as well as an evaluation of the risks associated with our loan portfolio, including the size and composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and geographic concentrations within the portfolio. The current stress on the U.S. economy and the local economies in which we do business may be greater or last longer than expected, resulting in, among other things, greater than expected deterioration in credit quality of our loan portfolio, or in the value of collateral securing these loans. Our ALLL may not be adequate to cover eventual loan losses, and future provisions for loan losses could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, in order to maximize the collection of loan balances, we sometimes modify loan terms when there is a reasonable chance that an appropriate modification would allow our client to continue servicing the debt. If such modifications ultimately are less effective at mitigating loan losses than we expect, we may incur losses in excess of the specific amount of ALLL associated with a modified loan, and this would result in additional provision for loan losses.On December 20, 2012, the FASB issued for public comment a Proposed Accounting Standards Update, Financial Instruments–Credit Losses (Subtopic 825-15) (the Credit Loss Proposal), that would substantially change the accounting for credit losses under U.S. GAAP. Under U.S. GAAP's current standards, credit losses are not reflected in financial statements until it is probable that the credit loss has been incurred. Under the Credit Loss Proposal, an entity would reflect in its financial statements its current estimate of credit losses on financial assets over the expected life of each financial asset. Comments on the Credit Loss Proposal are due by April 30, 2013. The Credit Loss Proposal, if adopted as proposed, may have a negative impact on our reported earnings, capital, regulatory capital ratios, as well as on regulatory limits which are based on capital (e.g., loans to affiliates) since it would accelerate the the recognition of estimated credit losses.We may have more credit risk and higher credit losses to the extent our loans are concentrated by loan type, industry segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or collateral. Our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our loans are concentrated in borrowers engaged in the same or similar activities or in borrowers who as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions. We experienced the effect of concentration risk in 2009 and 2010 when we incurred greater than expected losses in our residential real estate loan portfolio due to a housing slowdown and greater than expected deterioration in residential real estate values in many markets, particularly several Florida MSAs. As Florida is our largest banking state in terms of loans and deposits, further deterioration in real estate values and underlying economic conditions in those markets or elsewhere could result in materially higher credit losses. Florida and other states in our footprint have suffered significant declines in home values and significant declines in economic activity. A further deterioration in economic conditions, housing conditions, or real estate values in these states could result in materially higher credit losses. For additional information, see the "Loans", "Allowance for Credit Losses", “Risk Management–Credit Risk Management” and “Critical Accounting Policies–Allowance for Credit Losses” sections in the MD&A and Notes 6 and 7, "Loans" and "Allowance for Credit Losses", to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. We will realize future losses if the proceeds we receive upon liquidation of nonperforming assets are less than the carrying value of such assets.Nonperforming assets are recorded on our financial statements at the estimated net realizable value that we expect to receive from ultimately disposing of the assets. We could realize losses in the future as a result of deteriorating market conditions if the proceeds we receive upon dispositions of nonperforming assets are less than the carrying value of such assets.A downgrade in the U.S. government's sovereign credit rating, or in the credit ratings of instruments issued, insured or guaranteed by related institutions, agencies or instrumentalities, could result in risks to us and general economic conditions that we are not able to predict.On August 5, 2011, S&P cut the U.S. government's sovereign credit rating of long-term U.S. federal debt to AA+ from AAA while keeping its outlook negative. Further, Moody's lowered its outlook to "Negative" on June 2, 2011 and Fitch lowered its outlook to "Negative" on November 28, 2011, where they both remain. As a result, there continues to be the perceived risk of a sovereign credit ratings downgrade of the U.S. government, including the rating of U.S. Treasury securities. It is foreseeable that the ratings and perceived creditworthiness of instruments issued, insured or guaranteed by institutions, agencies or instrumentalities directly linked to the U.S. government could also be correspondingly affected by any such downgrade. Instruments of this nature are key assets on the balance sheets of financial institutions, including us, and are widely used as collateral by financial institutions to meet their day-to-day cash flows in the short−term debt market. A downgrade of the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government and perceived creditworthiness of U.S. government−related obligations could impact our ability to obtain funding that is collateralized by affected instruments, as well as affecting the pricing of that funding when it is available. A downgrade may also adversely affect the market value of such instruments. We cannot predict if, when or how any changes to the credit ratings or perceived creditworthiness of these organizations will affect economic conditions. Such ratings actions could result in a significant adverse impact on us. In addition, we presently 13deliver a material portion of the residential mortgage loans we originate into government−sponsored institutions, agencies or instrumentalities (or instruments insured or guaranteed thereby). We cannot predict if, when or how any changes to the credit ratings of these organizations will affect their ability to finance residential mortgage loans. Such ratings actions, if any, could result in a significant change to our mortgage business. A downgrade of the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government or the credit ratings of related institutions, agencies or instrumentalities would significantly exacerbate the other risks to which we are subject and any related adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The failure of the European Union to stabilize the fiscal condition and creditworthiness of its weaker member economies could have international implications potentially impacting global financial institutions, the financial markets, and the economic recovery underway in the U.S.Certain European Union member countries have fiscal obligations greater than their fiscal revenue, which has caused investor concern over such countries ability to continue to service their debt and foster economic growth. Currently, the European debt crisis has caused credit spreads to widen in the fixed income debt markets, and liquidity to be less abundant. A weaker European economy may transcend Europe, cause investors to lose confidence in the safety and soundness of European financial institutions and the stability of European member economies, and likewise affect U.S.-based financial institutions, the stability of the global financial markets and the economic recovery underway in the U.S. Should the U.S. economic recovery be adversely impacted by these factors, loan and asset growth at U.S. financial institutions, like us, could be affected. We have taken steps since the 2008-2009 financial crisis to strengthen our liquidity position. Nevertheless, a return of the volatile economic conditions experienced in the U.S. during 2008-2009, including the adverse conditions in the fixed income debt markets, for an extended period of time, particularly if left unmitigated by policy measures, may materially and adversely affect us. Weakness in the real estate market, including the secondary residential mortgage loan markets, has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us.Weakness in the non-agency secondary market for residential mortgage loans has limited the market for and liquidity of many mortgage loans. The effects of ongoing mortgage market challenges, combined with the correction in residential real estate market prices and reduced levels of home sales, could result in further price reductions in single family home values, adversely affecting the value of collateral securing mortgage loans that we hold, and mortgage loan originations and profits on sales of mortgage loans. Lower real estate prices have caused cyclically higher delinquencies and losses on mortgage-related loans. These conditions have resulted in losses, write downs and impairment charges in our mortgage and other lines of business. Continuing declines in real estate values, low home sales volumes, financial stress on borrowers as a result of unemployment, interest rate resets on ARMs or other factors could have further adverse effects on borrowers that could result in higher delinquencies and greater charge-offs in future periods, which would adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, counterparties to insurance arrangements used to mitigate risk associated with increased defaults in the real estate market are stressed by weaknesses in the real estate market and a commensurate increase in the number of claims. Further, decreases in real estate values might adversely affect the creditworthiness of state and local governments, and this might result in decreased profitability or credit losses from loans made to such governments. A decline in home values or overall economic weakness could also have an adverse impact upon the value of real estate or other assets which we own as a result of foreclosing a loan and our ability to realize value on such assets.We are subject to certain risks related to originating and selling mortgages. We may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers as a result of breaches of representations and warranties, borrower fraud, or certain breaches of our servicing agreements, and this could harm our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition.We originate and often sell mortgage loans. When we sell mortgage loans, whether as whole loans or pursuant to a securitization, we are required to make customary representations and warranties to the purchaser about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated. Our whole loan sale agreements require us to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans in the event that we breach any of these representations or warranties. In addition, we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of borrower fraud or in the event of early payment default of the borrower on a mortgage loan. Likewise, we are required to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans if we breach a representation or warranty in connection with our securitizations, whether or not we were the originator of the loan. While in many cases we may have a remedy available against the originating broker or correspondent, often these may not be as broad as the remedies available to a purchaser of mortgage loans against us, and we face the further risk that the originating broker or correspondent may not have the financial capacity to satisfy remedies that may be available to us. Therefore, if a purchaser enforces its remedies against us, we may not be able to recover our losses from the originating broker or correspondent. We have received a number of repurchase and indemnity demands from purchasers. These have resulted in an increase in the amount of losses for repurchases. While we have taken steps to enhance our underwriting policies and procedures, these steps will not reduce risk associated with loans sold in the past. If repurchase and indemnity demands increase materially, our results of operations may be adversely affected.14During the third quarter of 2012, we recorded a $371 million provision for mortgage repurchase losses, primarily related to loans sold to the GSEs prior to 2009, and the resulting mortgage repurchase reserve reflects the estimated incurred losses on repurchase demands for this population of loans. Accordingly, we expect that future mortgage repurchase provisions will decrease substantially from levels experienced in recent quarters. However, our estimate of losses is highly dependent on GSE repurchase requests and related behavior, and other factors. For additional information, see Note 17, “Reinsurance Arrangements and Guarantees,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K, and the following sections of MD&A in this Form 10-K–"Noninterest Income”, "Other Nonperforming Assets”, and "Critical Accounting Policies." Finally, we have received indemnification requests related to our servicing of loans owned or insured by other parties, primarily GSEs. Typically, such a claim seeks to impose a compensatory fee on us for departures from GSE service levels. In most cases, this is related to delays in the foreclosure process. Additionally, we have received indemnification requests where an investor or insurer has suffered a loss due to a breach of the servicing agreement. While the number of such claims has been small, these could increase in the future. See additional discussion in Note 17, “Reinsurance Arrangements and Guarantees,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.Financial difficulties or credit downgrades of mortgage and bond insurers may adversely affect our servicing and investment portfolios. Our servicing portfolio includes certain mortgage loans that carry some level of insurance from one or more mortgage insurance companies. To the extent that any of these companies experience financial difficulties or credit downgrades, we may be required, as servicer of the insured loan on behalf of the investor, to obtain replacement coverage with another provider, possibly at a higher cost than the coverage we would replace. We may be responsible for some or all of the incremental cost of the new coverage for certain loans depending on the terms of our servicing agreement with the investor and other circumstances. Similarly, some of the mortgage loans we hold for investment or for sale carry mortgage insurance. If a mortgage insurer is unable to meet its credit obligations with respect to an insured loan, we might incur higher credit losses if replacement coverage is not obtained. We also have investments in municipal bonds that are guaranteed against loss by bond insurers. The value of these bonds and the payment of principal and interest on them may be adversely affected by financial difficulties or credit downgrades experienced by the bond insurers. We face certain risks as a servicer of loans. Also, we may be terminated as a servicer or master servicer, be required to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse investors for credit losses on a mortgage loan, or incur costs, liabilities, fines and other sanctions if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations, including our obligations with respect to mortgage loan foreclosure actions. We act as servicer and/or master servicer for mortgage loans included in securitizations and for unsecuritized mortgage loans owned by investors. As a servicer or master servicer for those loans, we have certain contractual obligations to the securitization trusts, investors or other third parties, including, in our capacity as a servicer, foreclosing on defaulted mortgage loans or, to the extent consistent with the applicable securitization or other investor agreement, considering alternatives to foreclosure such as loan modifications or short sales and, in our capacity as a master servicer, overseeing the servicing of mortgage loans by the servicer. Generally, our servicing obligations are set by contract, for which we receive a contractual fee. However, the costs to perform contracted-for services has been increasing, which reduces our profitability. Further, GSEs can amend their servicing guidelines, which can increase the scope or costs of the services we are required to perform without any corresponding increase in our servicing fee. Further, the CFPB has implemented national servicing standards which become effective on January 10, 2014 and which may further increase the scope and costs of services which we are required to perform. In addition there has been a significant increase in state laws that implement additional servicing requirements that increase the scope and cost of our servicing obligations.Further, if we commit a material breach of our obligations as servicer or master servicer, we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period of time following notice, which can generally be given by the securitization trustee or a specified percentage of security holders, causing us to lose servicing income. In addition, we may be required to indemnify the securitization trustee against losses from any failure by us, as a servicer or master servicer, to perform our servicing obligations or any act or omission on our part that involves willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence. For certain investors and/or certain transactions, we may be contractually obligated to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse the investor for credit losses incurred on the loan as a remedy for servicing errors with respect to the loan. If we have increased repurchase obligations because of claims that we did not satisfy our obligations as a servicer or master servicer, or increased loss severity on such repurchases, we may have to materially increase our repurchase reserve. We may incur costs if we are required to, or if we elect to re-execute or re-file documents or take other action in our capacity as a servicer in connection with pending or completed foreclosures. We may incur litigation costs if the validity of a foreclosure action is challenged by a borrower. If a court were to overturn a foreclosure because of errors or deficiencies in the foreclosure process, we may have liability to the borrower and/or to any title insurer of the property sold in foreclosure if the required process was not followed. These costs and liabilities may not be legally or otherwise reimbursable to us, particularly to the 15extent they relate to securitized mortgage loans. In addition, if certain documents required for a foreclosure action are missing or defective, we could be obligated to cure the defect or repurchase the loan. We may incur a liability to securitization investors relating to delays or deficiencies in our processing of mortgage assignments or other documents necessary to comply with state law governing foreclosures. The fair value of our MSRs may be adversely affected to the extent our servicing costs increase because of higher foreclosure costs. Further, we may be subject to fines and other sanctions, including a foreclosure moratorium or suspension or a requirement to forgive or modify the loan obligations of certain of our borrowers, imposed by Federal or state regulators as a result of actual or perceived deficiencies in our foreclosure practices or in the foreclosure practices of other mortgage loan servicers. Any of these actions may harm our reputation or adversely affect our residential mortgage origination or servicing business. In 2011, the Federal Reserve conducted a horizontal review of the nation's largest mortgage loan servicers, including us. Following this review, we and other servicers entered into a Consent Order with the Federal Reserve. We describe the Consent Order in Note 19, “Contingencies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K and "Nonperforming Assets" in this MD&A. The Consent Order required us to improve certain mortgage servicing and foreclosure processes and to retain an independent foreclosure consultant to conduct a review of residential foreclosure actions pending during 2009 and 2010 to identify any errors, misrepresentations or deficiencies, determine whether any instances so identified resulted in financial injury, and prepare a written report detailing the findings. On January 7, 2013, we, along with nine other mortgage servicers, entered into an Acceleration and Remediation Agreement with the OCC and the Federal Reserve to amend the 2011 Consent Order. This agreement ends the independent foreclosure review process created by the Consent Order, replacing it with an accelerated remediation program. Pursuant to the agreement, we will make a cash payment of $63 million to fund lump-sum payments to borrowers who faced a foreclosure action on their primary residence between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2010, and will commit $100 million to affect loss mitigation or other foreclosure prevention actions. The impact of the cash payment is included in our consolidated financial results at December 31, 2012, and we expect that our existing ALLL or other activities will be sufficient to provide for the loss mitigation or other foreclosure prevention actions. We filed the Consent Order as Exhibit 10.25 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.As a result of the Federal Reserve's review of the Company's residential mortgage loan servicing and foreclosure processing practices that preceded the Consent Order, the Federal Reserve announced that it would impose a civil money penalty. At this time, no such penalty has been imposed, and the amount and terms of such a potential penalty have not been finally determined. We also continue with settlement discussions with the U.S. and States Attorneys General related to mortgage servicing claims as discussed in Note 19, "Contingencies" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. We have accrued for the anticipated cost of resolving these and other potential claims in our financial results.We are subject to risks related to delays in the foreclosure process. When we originate a mortgage loan, we do so with the expectation that if the borrower defaults then our ultimate loss is mitigated by the value of the collateral which secures the mortgage loan. Our ability to mitigate our losses on such defaulted loans depends upon our ability to promptly foreclose upon such collateral after an appropriate cure period. In some states, the large number of foreclosures which have occurred has resulted in delays in foreclosing. In some instances, our practices or failures to adhere to our policies has contributed to these delays (see “Management's Discussion and Analysis-Nonperforming Assets” in this Form 10-K). Any delay in the foreclosure process will adversely affect us by increasing our expenses related to carrying such assets, such as taxes, insurance, and other carrying costs, and exposes us to losses as a result of potential additional declines in the value of such collateral. We may continue to suffer increased losses in our loan portfolio despite enhancement of our underwriting policies and practices.We seek to mitigate risks inherent in our loan portfolio by adhering to specific underwriting policies and practices, which often include analysis of a borrower's credit history, financial statements, tax returns and cash flow projections; valuation of collateral based on reports of independent appraisers; and verification of liquid assets. Our underwriting policies, practices and standards are periodically reviewed and, if appropriate, enhanced in response to changing market conditions and/or corporate strategies. Examples include: client eligibility requirements, documentation requirements, loan types, collateral types, LTV ratios, and minimum credit scores. Prior reviews have resulted in more stringent documentation standards, lower maximum LTV ratios, and channel and client type restrictions. These actions have contributed to a reduction in exposure to certain higher risk portfolio segments, such as higher risk mortgage, home equity, and commercial construction. These actions have also contributed to declines in early stage delinquencies and nonperforming loans. While these changes have resulted in improving asset quality metrics, elevated losses may continue to occur due to economic factors, changes in borrower behavior, or other factors.Our mortgage production and servicing revenue can be volatile. We earn revenue from fees we receive for originating mortgage loans and for servicing mortgage loans. When rates rise, the demand for mortgage loans usually tends to fall, reducing the revenue we receive from loan originations. Under the same 16conditions, revenue from our MSRs can increase through increases in fair value, although we may not realize some or all of this benefit due to derivative hedges on the fair value of our MSRs. When rates fall, mortgage originations usually tend to increase and the value of our MSRs usually tends to decline, also with some offsetting revenue effect. Even though they can act as a “natural hedge,” the hedge is not perfect, either in amount or timing. For example, the negative effect on revenue from a decrease in the fair value of our MSRs is generally immediate, but any offsetting revenue benefit from more originations and the MSRs relating to the new loans would generally be recognized over time. It is also possible that, because of economic conditions and/or a deteriorating housing market, even if interest rates were to fall, mortgage originations may also fall or any increase in mortgage originations may not be enough to offset the decrease in the MSRs value caused by the lower rates. During 2012, our mortgage production income benefited from high levels of refinancing activity and historically high gain on sale margins for our mortgage loans. While we continue to believe that there remains a substantial number of mortgages eligible to be refinanced, our mortgage production income likely will be adversely affected if refinance activity declines or if gain on sale margins narrow.We typically use derivatives and other instruments to hedge our mortgage banking interest rate risk. We generally do not hedge all of our risk, and we may not be successful in hedging any of the risk. Hedging is a complex process, requiring sophisticated models and constant monitoring. We may use hedging instruments tied to U.S. Treasury rates, LIBOR or Eurodollars that may not perfectly correlate with the value or income being hedged. We could incur significant losses from our hedging activities. There may be periods where we elect not to use derivatives and other instruments to hedge mortgage banking interest rate risk. For additional information, see Note 16, “Derivative Financial Instruments,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. As a financial services company, changes in general business or economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.The continuing weakness or further weakening in business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which we do business could have one or more of the following adverse impacts on our business: •A decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us;•A decrease in the value of our LHFS or other assets;•A loss of clients, reduced earnings, and/or a suppressed stock price could trigger an impairment of certain intangible assets, such as goodwill;•An increase in the number of clients and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to us; or•An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults could result in a higher level of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses, and valuation adjustments on LHFS. Changes in market interest rates or capital markets could adversely affect our revenue and expense, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital and liquidity.Market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, and other relevant market rates or prices. Interest rate risk, defined as the exposure of net interest income and MVE to adverse movements in interest rates, is our primary market risk, and mainly arises from the structure of the balance sheet, which includes all loans. Variable rate loans, prior to any hedging related actions, are approximately 57% of total loans and approximately 43% of total loans after giving consideration to hedging related actions. We are also exposed to market risk in our trading instruments, AFS investment portfolio, MSRs, loan warehouse and pipeline, and debt and brokered deposits carried at fair value. ALCO meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing our open positions and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk. The policies established by ALCO are reviewed and approved by our Board.Given our business mix, and the fact that most of the assets and liabilities are financial in nature, we tend to be sensitive to market interest rate movements and the performance of the financial markets. In addition to the impact of the general economy, changes in interest rates or in valuations in the debt or equity markets could directly impact us in one or more of the following ways:•The yield on earning assets and rates paid on interest−bearing liabilities may change in disproportionate ways;•The value of certain balance sheet and off−balance sheet financial instruments or the value of equity investments that we hold could decline;•The value of assets for which we provide processing services could decline; •The value of our pension plan assets could decline, thereby potentially requiring us to further fund the plan; or•To the extent we access capital markets to raise funds to support our business, such changes could affect the cost of such funds or the ability to raise such funds. 17Our net interest income is the interest we earn on loans, debt securities and other assets we hold less the interest we pay on our deposits, long-term and short-term debt, and other liabilities. Net interest income is a function of both our net interest margin–the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and our other sources of funding–and the amount of earning assets we hold. Changes in either our net interest margin or the amount of earning assets we hold could affect our net interest income and our earnings. Changes in interest rates can affect our net interest margin. Although the yield we earn on our assets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction in response to changes in interest rates, one can rise or fall faster than the other, causing our net interest margin to expand or contract. Our liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than our assets, so they may adjust faster in response to changes in interest rates. When interest rates rise, our funding costs may rise faster than the yield we earn on our assets, causing our net interest margin to contract until the asset yield catches up. The amount and type of earning assets we hold can affect our yield and net interest margin. We hold earning assets in the form of loans and investment securities, among other assets. As noted above, if current economic conditions persist, we may continue to see lower demand for loans by creditworthy customers, reducing our yield. In addition, we may invest in lower yielding investment securities for a variety of reasons. Changes in the slope of the “yield curve”–or the spread between short-term and long-term interest rates–could also reduce our net interest margin. Normally, the yield curve is upward sloping, meaning short-term rates are lower than long-term rates. Because our liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than our assets, when the yield curve flattens or even inverts, our net interest margin could decrease as our cost of funds increases relative to the yield we can earn on our assets. The interest we earn on our assets and our costs to fund those assets may be affected by changes in market interest rates, changes in the slope of the yield curve, and our cost of funding. This could lower our net interest margin and our net interest income. We discuss these topics in greater detail under the caption “Market Risk Management” in the MD&A in this Form 10-K.Amidst the continued stagnant economic conditions seen during 2012, the Federal Reserve indicated in January 2013 that highly accommodative monetary policy will remain for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens and as such, it anticipates maintaining key interest rates at exceptionally low levels as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6.5% and its long-term inflation goals are not met. A persistent low interest rate environment likely will adversely affect the interest income we earn on loans and investments.We assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on our earnings under various scenarios that differ based on assumptions about the direction, magnitude and speed of interest rate changes and the slope of the yield curve. We hedge some of that interest rate risk with interest rate derivatives. We may not hedge all of our interest rate risk. There is always the risk that changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income and our earnings in material amounts, especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different than what we assumed. For example, if interest rates rise or fall faster than we assumed or the slope of the yield curve changes, we may incur significant losses on debt securities we hold as investments. To reduce our interest rate risk, we may rebalance our investment and loan portfolios, refinance our debt and take other strategic actions. We may incur losses when we take such actions. For additional information, see the “Enterprise Risk Management” section in the MD&A in this Form 10-K. Changes in interest rates could also reduce the value of our MSRs and mortgages held for sale, reducing our earnings. We have a sizable portfolio of MSRs. An MSR is the right to service a mortgage loan–collect principal, interest and escrow amounts–for a fee. We acquire MSRs when we keep the servicing rights after we sell or securitize the loans we have originated or when we purchase the servicing rights to mortgage loans originated by other lenders. We initially measure all and carry substantially all our residential MSRs using the fair value measurement method. Fair value is the present value of estimated future net servicing income, calculated based on a number of variables, including assumptions about the likelihood of prepayment by borrowers. Changes in interest rates can affect prepayment assumptions and thus fair value. When interest rates fall, borrowers are usually more likely to prepay their mortgage loans by refinancing them at a lower rate. As the likelihood of prepayment increases, the fair value of our MSRs can decrease. Each quarter we evaluate the fair value of our MSRs and any related hedges, and any decrease in fair value reduces earnings in the period in which the decrease occurs. We measure at fair value prime mortgages held for sale for which an active secondary market and readily available market prices exist. We also measure at fair value certain other interests we hold related to residential loan sales and securitizations. Similar to other interest-bearing securities, the value of these mortgages held for sale and other interests may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. For example, if market interest rates increase relative to the yield on these mortgages held for sale and other interests, their fair value may fall. We may not hedge this risk, and even if we do hedge the risk with 18derivatives and other instruments we may still incur significant losses from changes in the value of these mortgages held for sale and other interests or from changes in the value of the hedging instruments. For additional information, see “Enterprise Risk Management–Other Market Risk” and “Critical Accounting Policies” in the MD&A, and Note 9, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. Changes are being considered in the method for determining LIBOR and it is not apparent how any such changes could affect the value of debt securities and other financial obligations held or issued by SunTrust that are linked to LIBOR, or how such changes could affect the Company's financial condition or results of operations.Beginning in 2008, concerns have been raised about the accuracy of the calculation of the daily LIBOR, which is currently overseen by the BBA. The BBA has taken steps to change the process for determining LIBOR by increasing the number of banks surveyed to set LIBOR and to strengthen the oversight of the process. In addition, the final report of the Wheatley Review of LIBOR, published in September 2012, set forth recommendations relating to the setting and administration of LIBOR, and the UK government has announced that it intends to incorporate these recommendations in new legislation.At the present time it is uncertain what changes, if any, may be required or made by the UK government or other governmental or regulatory authorities in the method for determining LIBOR. Accordingly, at the present time it is not apparent whether or to what extent any such changes would have an adverse impact on the value of any LIBOR-linked securities issued by us or any loans, derivatives and other financial obligations or extensions of credit for which we are an obligor, or whether or to what extent any such changes would have an adverse effect on the value of any LIBOR-linked securities, loans, derivatives and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us or on our financial condition or results of operations.The fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings.The Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S. Its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments, both of which affect the net interest margin. They can also materially decrease the value of financial assets we hold, such as debt securities and MSRs. In particular, programs to facilitate loan refinancing, such as the recently expanded HARP, may cause us to reevaluate repayment assumptions related to the prepayment speed assumptions related to loans that we service, and this may adversely affect the fair value of our MSR asset. Federal Reserve policies can also adversely affect borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans, or could adversely create asset bubbles which result from prolonged periods of accommodative policy, and which in turn result in volatile markets and rapidly declining collateral values. Changes in Federal Reserve policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict; consequently, the impact of these changes on our activities and results of operations is difficult to predict. Depressed market values for our stock may require us to write down goodwill.Numerous facts and circumstances are considered when evaluating the carrying value of our goodwill. One of those considerations is the estimated fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of a reporting unit is impacted by the reporting unit's expected financial performance and susceptibility to adverse economic, regulatory, and legislative changes. The estimated fair values of the individual reporting units are assessed for reasonableness by reviewing a variety of indicators, including our market capitalization evaluated over a reasonable period of time. While this comparison provides some relative market information regarding the estimated fair value of the reporting units, it is not determinative and needs to be evaluated in the context of the current economic and political environment. However, significant and/or sustained declines in our market capitalization, especially in relation to our book value, could be an indication of potential impairment of goodwill.Clients could pursue alternatives to bank deposits, causing us to lose a relatively inexpensive source of funding.Checking and savings account balances and other forms of client deposits could decrease if clients perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, as providing superior expected returns. When clients move money out of bank deposits in favor of alternative investments, we can lose a relatively inexpensive source of funds, increasing our funding costs.Consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions, which could affect net income.Technology and other changes now allow parties to complete financial transactions without banks. For example, consumers can pay bills and transfer funds directly without banks. This process could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of client deposits and the income generated from those deposits.We have businesses other than banking which subject us to a variety of risks.We are a diversified financial services company. This diversity subjects earnings to a broader variety of risks and uncertainties.19Hurricanes and other disasters may adversely affect loan portfolios and operations and increase the cost of doing business.Large scale natural or man-made disasters may significantly affect loan portfolios by damaging properties pledged as collateral and by impairing the ability of certain borrowers to repay their loans. The nature and level of disasters cannot be predicted and may be exacerbated by global climate change. The ultimate impact of a disaster on future financial results is difficult to predict and will be affected by a number of factors, including the extent of damage to the collateral, the extent to which damaged collateral is not covered by insurance, the extent to which unemployment and other economic conditions caused by the disaster adversely affect the ability of borrowers to repay their loans, and the cost of collection and foreclosure moratoriums, loan forbearances and other accommodations granted to borrowers and other clients.Negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact business and revenues.As a financial institution, our earnings and capital are subject to risks associated with negative public opinion. The reputation of the financial services industry in general has been damaged as a result of the financial crisis and other matters affecting the financial services industry, including mortgage foreclosure issues. Negative public opinion regarding us could result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, the failure of any product or service sold by us to meet our clients' expectations or applicable regulatory requirements, corporate governance and acquisitions, or from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to keep and attract and/or retain clients and personnel and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action. Actual or alleged conduct by one of our businesses can result in negative public opinion about our other businesses. Negative public opinion could also affect our credit ratings, which are important to accessing unsecured wholesale borrowings. Significant changes in these ratings could change the cost and availability of these sources of funding.We rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.Third parties provide key components of our business infrastructure such as banking services, processing, and internet connections and network access. Any disruption in such services provided by these third parties or any failure of these third parties to handle current or higher volumes of use could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to clients and otherwise to conduct business. Technological or financial difficulties of a third party service provider could adversely affect our business to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party. Further, in some instances we may be responsible for failures of such third parties to comply with government regulations. We may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third party failures and our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from system failures or other disruptions. Failures in our business infrastructure could interrupt the operations or increase the costs of doing business.A failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses. We depend upon our ability to process, record, and monitor a large number of client transactions on a continuous basis. As client, public, and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased, our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions, and breakdowns. Our business, financial, accounting, data processing, or other operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. For example, there could be sudden increases in client transaction volume; electrical or telecommunications outages; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, and hurricanes; disease pandemics; events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and, as described below, cyber attacks. Although we have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and clients. Information security risks for large financial institutions such as ours have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties. As noted above, our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission, and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks. Our banking, brokerage, investment advisory, and capital markets businesses rely on our digital technologies, computer and email systems, software, and networks to conduct their operations. In addition, to access our products and services, our clients may use personal smartphones, tablet PCs, personal computers, and other mobile devices that are beyond our control systems. Although we have information security procedures and controls in place, our technologies, systems, networks, and our clients' devices may become the target of cyber attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our or our clients' confidential, proprietary and other information, or otherwise disrupt our or our clients' or other third parties' business operations. 20For example, in October of 2012, our main online banking website, as well as those of several other prominent financial institutions, was subject to a series of Distributed Denial of Service Attacks. These attacks, which were also generally publicized in the media, did not result in any financial loss, fraud or breach of client data or service disruptions of any materiality.Third parties with whom we do business or that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing houses, financial intermediaries, or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations, could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints. Although to date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks or other information security breaches, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, our prominent size and scale, and our role in the financial services industry, our plans to continue to implement our internet banking and mobile banking channel strategies and develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our clients when and how they want to be served, our expanded geographic footprint, the outsourcing of some of our business operations, and the continued uncertain global economic environment. As a result, cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a focus for us. As threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate information security vulnerabilities.Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and clients, or cyber attacks or security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our clients use to access our products and services could result in client attrition, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, in the past have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations.We depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties.In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors.Regulation by federal and state agencies could adversely affect the business, revenue, and profit margins.We are heavily regulated by federal and state agencies. This regulation is to protect depositors, the federal DIF and the banking system as a whole. The U.S. Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations, and policies for possible changes. Changes to statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies, including interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations, or policies, could affect us adversely, including limiting the types of financial services and products we may offer and/or increasing the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products. Also, if we do not comply with laws, regulations, or policies, we could receive regulatory sanctions and damage to our reputation.Competition in the financial services industry is intense and could result in losing business or margin declines.We operate in a highly competitive industry that could become even more competitive as a result of reform of the financial services industry resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act and other legislative, regulatory and technological changes, and continued consolidation. We face aggressive competition from other domestic and foreign lending institutions and from numerous other providers of financial services. The ability of nonbanking financial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified competition. Because nonbanking financial institutions are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies, they can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures. Securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies, can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking, 21and may acquire banks and other financial institutions. This may significantly change the competitive environment in which we conduct business. Some of our competitors have greater financial resources and/or face fewer regulatory constraints. As a result of these various sources of competition, we could lose business to competitors or be forced to price products and services on less advantageous terms to retain or attract clients, either of which would adversely affect our profitability.Maintaining or increasing market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services.Our success depends, in part, on our ability to adapt products and services to evolving industry standards. There is increasing pressure to provide products and services at lower prices. This can reduce net interest income and noninterest income from fee-based products and services. In addition, the widespread adoption of new technologies could require us to make substantial capital expenditures to modify or adapt existing products and services or develop new products and services. We may not be successful in introducing new products and services in response to industry trends or developments in technology, or those new products may not achieve market acceptance. As a result, we could lose business, be forced to price products and services on less advantageous terms to retain or attract clients, or be subject to cost increases, any of which would adversely affect our profitability.We might not pay dividends on your common stock.Holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so. Further, in February 2009, the Federal Reserve required bank holding companies to substantially reduce or eliminate dividends. Since that time, the Federal Reserve has indicated that increased capital distributions would generally not be considered prudent in the absence of a well-developed capital plan and a capital position that would remain strong even under adverse conditions. As a result, we expect that any substantial increase in our dividend will require the approval of the Federal Reserve. Refer to the discussion under the caption "We are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines and, if we fail to meet these guidelines, our financial condition would be adversely affected," above.Additionally, our obligations under the warrant agreements (that we entered into with the U.S. Treasury as part of the CPP) will increase to the extent that we pay dividends prior to December 31, 2018 exceeding $0.54 per share per quarter, which was the amount of dividends we paid when we first participated in the CPP. Specifically, the exercise price and the number of shares to be issued upon exercise of the warrants will be adjusted proportionately (that is, adversely to us) as specified in a formula contained in the warrant agreements.Our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends.We are a separate and distinct legal entity from our subsidiaries, including the Bank. We receive substantially all of our revenue from dividends from our subsidiaries. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common stock and interest and principal on our debt. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that our Bank and certain of our nonbank subsidiaries may pay us. Also, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary's creditors. Limitations on our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and on our ability to pay dividends on common stock. Additionally, if our subsidiaries' earnings are not sufficient to make dividend payments to us while maintaining adequate capital levels, we may not be able to make dividend payments to our common stockholders.Disruptions in our ability to access global capital markets may adversely affect our capital resources and liquidity.In managing our consolidated balance sheet, we depend on access to global capital markets to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs, and to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our clients. Other sources of contingent funding available to us includes inter-bank borrowings, repurchase agreements, FHLB capacity, and borrowings from the Federal Reserve discount window. Any occurrence that may limit our access to the capital markets, such as a decline in the confidence of debt investors, our depositors or counterparties participating in the capital markets, or a downgrade of our debt rating, may adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our liquidity.Any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets.Our issuer ratings are rated investment grade by the major rating agencies. There were no changes to our primary credit ratings during 2012. On February 27, 2012, Fitch affirmed our senior long- and short-term credit ratings and revised its outlook on our ratings from “Positive” to “Stable”. On December 10, 2012, S&P also affirmed our senior long- and short-term credit ratings; however, its outlook on our ratings was upgraded from “Stable” to “Positive”. Our credit ratings also remain on “Stable” outlook with Moody's and DBRS. Additional downgrades are possible, although not anticipated, given the “Stable” or "Positive" outlook from all four major rating agencies. 22The rating agencies regularly evaluate us, and their ratings are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength as well as factors not entirely within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. In light of the difficulties in the financial services industry and the housing and financial markets, there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings. Our failure to maintain those ratings could adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and increase our cost of capital. Credit ratings are one of numerous factors that influence our funding costs. Among our various retail and wholesale funding sources, credit ratings have a more direct impact only on the cost of wholesale funding as our primary source of retail funding is bank deposits, most of which are insured by the FDIC. During the most recent financial market crisis and economic recession, our senior debt credit spread to the matched maturity 5-year swap rate widened before we received any credit ratings downgrades in 2009 and began to tighten before we received our most recent credit rating downgrade in November 2010. After the loss of our A-1 short-term credit rating in April 2009 and capital raises in May and June 2009, more recent credit rating downgrades had little or no detrimental impact to our debt credit spreads. We expect that a one notch downgrade would have a relatively small impact on our debt credit spreads.We have in the past and may in the future pursue acquisitions, which could affect costs and from which we may not be able to realize anticipated benefits.We have historically pursued an acquisition strategy, and may continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities. We may not be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses into the existing operations, or expand into new markets. Once integrated, acquired operations may not achieve levels of revenues, profitability, or productivity comparable with those achieved by our existing operations, or otherwise perform as expected.Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies, and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. We may not properly ascertain all such risks prior to an acquisition or prior to such a risk impacting us while integrating an acquired company. As a result, difficulties encountered with acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Furthermore, we must generally receive federal regulatory approval before we can acquire a bank or bank holding company. In determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition, federal bank regulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition, financial condition, future prospects, including current and projected capital levels, the competence, experience, and integrity of management, compliance with laws and regulations, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including the acquiring institution's record of compliance under the CRA, and the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities. In addition, we cannot be certain when or if, or on what terms and conditions, any required regulatory approvals will be granted. Consequently, we might be required to sell portions of the acquired institution as a condition to receiving regulatory approval or we may not obtain regulatory approval for a proposed acquisition on acceptable terms or at all, in which case we would not be able to complete the acquisition despite the time and expenses invested in pursuing it.We are subject to certain litigation, and our expenses related to this litigation may adversely affect our results.From time to time we are subject to certain litigation in the ordinary course of our business. These claims and legal actions, including supervisory actions by our regulators, could involve large monetary claims and significant defense costs. During the current credit crisis, we have seen both the number of cases and our expenses related to those cases increase. The outcome of these cases is uncertain.We establish reserves for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. We may still incur legal costs for a matter even if we have not established a reserve. In addition, the actual cost of resolving a legal claim may be substantially higher than any amounts reserved for that matter. The ultimate resolution of a pending legal proceeding, depending on the remedy sought and granted, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. While we do not believe that any single case will have a material adverse effect on us, the cumulative burden of these cases may adversely affect our results. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. We may be exposed to substantial uninsured liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. For additional information, see Note 19, “Contingencies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.23We may incur fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations, possibly even inadvertent or unintentional violations. We maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that these will be effective. For example, in 2011, the Federal Reserve conducted a horizontal review of the nation's largest mortgage loan servicers, which resulted in our entering into a Consent Order with the Federal Reserve. We describe the Consent Order in Note 19, “Contingencies,” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K and in the "Nonperforming Assets" section of the MD&A. Further, we recently entered into a settlement agreement as part of the Independent Foreclosure Review established as a result of this Consent Order and pursuant to that settlement agreement we will make a $63 million cash payment (which was accrued in 2012) and provide $100 million in other mortgage assistance to borrowers through existing programs such as loan modifications. There may be other negative consequences resulting from other findings of noncompliance with regulations, including restrictions on certain activities. Such a finding may also damage our reputation.Further, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though there was in place at the time systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance. For example, we are subject to regulations issued by the OFAC that prohibit financial institutions from participating in the transfer of property belonging to the governments of certain foreign countries and designated nationals of those countries. OFAC may impose penalties for inadvertent or unintentional violations even if reasonable processes are in place to prevent the violations.We depend on the expertise of key personnel. If these individuals leave or change their roles without effective replacements, operations may suffer. The success of our business has been, and the continuing success will be, dependent to a large degree on the continued services of executive officers, especially our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, William H. Rogers, Jr., and other key personnel who have extensive experience in the industry. We generally do not carry key person life insurance on any of the executive officers or other key personnel. If we lose the services of any of these integral personnel and fail to manage a smooth transition to new personnel, the business could be adversely impacted.We may not be able to hire or retain additional qualified personnel and recruiting and compensation costs may increase as a result of turnover, both of which may increase costs and reduce profitability and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategies.Our success depends upon the ability to attract and retain highly motivated, well-qualified personnel. We face significant competition in the recruitment of qualified employees. Our ability to execute the business strategy and provide high quality service may suffer if we are unable to recruit or retain a sufficient number of qualified employees or if the costs of employee compensation or benefits increase substantially. Further, in June, 2010, the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the FDIC jointly issued comprehensive final guidance designed to ensure that incentive compensation policies do not undermine the safety and soundness of banking organizations by encouraging employees to take imprudent risks. This regulation significantly restricts the amount, form, and context in which we pay incentive compensation. Our accounting policies and processes are critical to how we report our financial condition and results of operations. They require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain.Accounting policies and processes are fundamental to how we record and report the financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. Several of our accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, we are required to make certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements, including in determining credit loss reserves, reserves related to litigation and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, among other items. If assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements are incorrect, we may experience material losses. Certain of our financial instruments, including trading assets and liabilities, AFS securities, certain loans, MSRs, private investments, structured notes and certain repurchase and resale agreements, among other items, require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare our financial statements. Where quoted market prices are not available, we may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management judgment. Some of these and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable price levels, making their valuation particularly subjective, being based on significant estimation and judgment. In addition, sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items, which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment and could lead to declines in our earnings. 24Management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management's judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, commitments, and contingencies. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, valuing an asset or liability, or recognizing or reducing a liability. We have established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. Because of the uncertainty surrounding our judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, we cannot guarantee that we will not be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements. See “Critical Accounting Policies” in the MD&A and Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.Changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition.From time to time, the FASB and SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. In addition, accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, SEC, banking regulators and our outside auditors) may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. Changes in financial accounting and reporting standards and changes in current interpretations may be beyond our control, can be hard to predict and could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in us restating prior period financial statements.Our stock price can be volatile.Our stock price can fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors including:•variations in our quarterly results;•changes in market valuations of companies in the financial services industry;•governmental and regulatory legislation or actions;•issuances of shares of common stock or other securities in the future;•changes in dividends;•the addition or departure of key personnel;•cyclical fluctuations;•changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts regarding us or shares of our common stock;•announcements by us or our competitors of new services or technology, acquisitions, or joint ventures; and•activity by short sellers and changing government restrictions on such activity.General market fluctuations, industry factors, and general economic and political conditions and events, such as terrorist attacks, economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes, credit loss trends, or currency fluctuations, also could cause our stock price to decrease regardless of operating results. For the above and other reasons, the market price of our securities may not accurately reflect the value of our securities, and you should consider this before relying on the market prices of our securities when making an investment decision.Our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accurately accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, that alternative reasoned judgments can be drawn, or that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.Our financial instruments carried at fair value expose us to certain market risks.We maintain at fair value a securities AFS portfolio and trading assets and liabilities which include various types of instruments and maturities. In addition, we elected to record selected fixed-rate debt, mortgage loans, MSRs and other financial instruments at fair value. The changes in fair value of the financial instruments carried at fair value are recognized in earnings. The financial instruments carried at fair value are exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates, market liquidity, and our market-based credit spreads, as well as to the risk of default by specific borrowers. We manage the market risks associated 25with these instruments through active hedging arrangements or broader ALM strategies. Changes in the market values of these financial instruments could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We may classify additional financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value in the future.Our revenues derived from our investment securities may be volatile and subject to a variety of risks.We generally maintain investment securities and trading positions in the fixed income, currency, commodity, and equity markets. Unrealized gains and losses associated with our investment portfolio and mark-to-market gains and losses associated with our trading portfolio are affected by many factors, including interest rate volatility, volatility in capital markets, and other economic factors. Our return on such investments and trading have in the past experienced, and will likely in the future experience, volatility and such volatility may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, accounting regulations may require us to record a charge prior to the actual realization of a loss when market valuations of such securities are impaired and such impairment is considered to be other than temporary.We may enter into transactions with off-balance sheet affiliates or our subsidiaries.We engage in a variety of transactions with off-balance sheet entities with which we are affiliated. While we have no obligation, contractual or otherwise, to do so, under certain limited circumstances, these transactions may involve providing some form of financial support to these entities. Any such actions may cause us to recognize current or future gains or losses. Depending on the nature and magnitude of any transaction we enter into with off-balance sheet entities, accounting rules may require us to consolidate the financial results of these entities with our financial results.Item 1B
