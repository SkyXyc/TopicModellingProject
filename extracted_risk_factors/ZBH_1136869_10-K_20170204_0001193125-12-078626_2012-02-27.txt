Risk Factors
 Risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could
negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations are discussed below and elsewhere in this report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known
to us or that are currently not believed to be significant to our business may also affect our actual results and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of the risks or

 
uncertainties described below or any additional risks and uncertainties actually occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
 If we fail to comply with the terms of the Corporate Integrity Agreement we entered into in September 2007, we may be
subject to exclusion from federal healthcare programs.  As previously reported, in September 2007 we settled an
investigation conducted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey (U.S. Attorney) into financial relationships between major orthopaedic manufacturers and consulting orthopaedic surgeons. As part of that settlement, we
entered into a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) with the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (OIG-HHS). A copy of the CIA is filed as an exhibit to this report. If we do not comply with the terms
of the CIA, we could be subject to exclusion by OIG-HHS from participation in federal healthcare programs, including Medicaid and Medicare.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The ongoing investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice regarding potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the sale of medical
devices in a number of foreign countries by companies in the medical device industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and cash flows. 
We are cooperating fully with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice with regard to an ongoing
investigation of potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the sale of medical devices in a number of foreign countries by companies in the medical device industry. Although we have adopted policies and procedures designed to
prevent improper payments and we train our employees, distributors and others concerning these issues, we cannot assure that violations of these requirements will not occur. If we are found to have violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, we may
face sanctions including fines, criminal penalties, disgorgement of profits and suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with governmental agencies or receive export licenses. 
In July 2011, we received Form FDA-483 Inspectional Observations from the FDA concerning quality systems at our Warsaw, Indiana
manufacturing facility and we may not be able to timely and adequately address the quality system issues raised by the FDA. 
Following a July 2011 routine inspection of our Warsaw, Indiana manufacturing facility, the FDA issued a Form 483 notice. The
Form 483 notice identified certain inspectional observations regarding the facility’s quality systems. The facility manufactures reconstructive products that are sold globally. We have responded in writing to the observations and met with
representatives of the district office of the FDA to discuss our response and action plans. We expect the FDA to conduct a re-inspection of this facility in the future to determine whether we have taken sufficient actions to address the observations
described in the Form 483 notice. If the FDA

is not satisfied with our response to the issues identified in the Form 483 notice, the FDA could take additional actions such as issuing a warning letter to us, which, among other things,
could adversely affect our ability to receive approvals of regulatory applications until the issues are resolved. Any of these possible sanctions could have an adverse impact on our revenues, financial position, results of operations and cash flows,
and otherwise harm our business and reputation.  Challenging global economic conditions could adversely affect our results
of operations.  During 2011, growth in the healthcare industry and our revenue growth were adversely affected by continuing
challenges in the global economy. Although the U.S. economy is recovering from the worst recession in decades, unemployment remains high and consumer confidence remains low, resulting in reduced numbers of insured patients and the deferral of
elective reconstructive procedures. Global economic conditions, particularly in Europe, our second-largest operating segment, remain uncertain. We believe that European austerity measures implemented to address the ongoing financial crisis
contributed to decreased healthcare utilization and increased pricing pressure for some of our products. We cannot assure you that challenges in the global economy will not continue to negatively impact procedure volumes, average selling prices and
reimbursement rates from third-party payors, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, we have experienced delays in the collection of receivables from hospitals in certain countries that have national healthcare
systems, including certain regions in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal, which are the countries most directly affected by the Euro zone crisis. Repayment of these receivables is dependent upon the financial stability of the economies of those
countries. Continuing high unemployment in the U.S., a worsening of the European financial crisis or a failure to receive payment of all or a significant portion of our European receivables could adversely affect our results of operations.
 If we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, our products may become obsolete over time, customers may not buy
our products and our revenue and profitability may decline.  Demand for our products may change, in certain cases, in ways
we may not anticipate because of: 


•
 
 evolving customer needs; 


•
 
 changing demographics; 


•
 
 slowing industry growth rates; 


•
 
 declines in the reconstructive implant market; 


•
 
 the introduction of new products and technologies; 


•
 
 evolving surgical philosophies; and 


•
 
 evolving industry standards.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements, our products may become obsolete over time. If that happens, our revenue and operating results would suffer. The success of our new
product offerings will depend on several factors, including our ability to: 


•
 
 properly identify and anticipate customer needs; 


•
 
 commercialize new products in a timely manner;




•
 
 manufacture and deliver instruments and products in sufficient volumes on time; 


•
 
 differentiate our offerings from competitors’ offerings; 


•
 
 achieve positive clinical outcomes for new products; 


•
 
 satisfy the increased demands by healthcare payors, providers and patients for shorter hospital stays, faster post-operative recovery and lower-cost
procedures; 


•
 
 innovate and develop new materials, product designs and surgical techniques; and 


•
 
 provide adequate medical education relating to new products.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In addition, new materials, product designs and surgical techniques that we develop may not be accepted quickly, in some or all markets, because of, among other factors: 


•
 
 entrenched patterns of clinical practice; 


•
 
 the need for regulatory clearance; and 


•
 
 uncertainty with respect to third-party reimbursement.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Moreover, innovations generally require a substantial investment in research and development before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not have the financial resources necessary to
fund the production. In addition, even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products, these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they
may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We conduct a significant amount of our sales activity outside of the U.S., which subjects us to additional business risks and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs.
 We sell our products in more than 100 countries and derived more than 45 percent of our net sales in 2011 from outside the
U.S. We intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales internationally, including in emerging markets, which could expose us to additional risks associated with international sales and operations. Our international operations are, and
will continue to be, subject to a number of risks and potential costs, including: 


•
 
 changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and programs; 


•
 
 unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements; 


•
 
 differing local product preferences and product requirements; 


•
 
 fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; 


•
 
 diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries outside of the U.S.; 


•
 
 trade protection measures and import or export requirements that may prevent us from shipping products to a particular market and may increase our
operating costs; 


•
 
 foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.; 


•
 
 complex data privacy requirements and labor relations laws; 


•
 
 extraterritorial effects of U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; 


•
 
 effects of foreign anti-corruption laws, such as the UK Bribery Act;

•
 
 difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations; 


•
 
 labor force instability; 


•
 
 potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws; and 


•
 
 political and economic instability.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Violations of foreign laws or regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation.
 We are subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations, which can increase our costs, cause our
profitability to decline and expose us to counterparty risks.  A substantial portion of our foreign revenues is generated
in Europe and Japan. The U.S. dollar value of our foreign-generated revenues varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations. Significant increases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro or the Japanese Yen, as well as other
currencies, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Although we address currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities, and, on a limited basis, through the use of derivative financial
instruments, those actions may not prove to be fully effective.  We may fail to adequately protect our proprietary
technology and other intellectual property, which would allow competitors or others to take advantage of our research and development efforts.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Our long-term success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products. If we fail to obtain or maintain adequate intellectual property protection, we may not be able to
prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies. Also, our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents, and issued patents are subject to claims concerning priority, scope and other issues.
 The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the courts have not consistently treated the breadth of claims allowed or interpreted
in orthopaedic reconstructive implant and biotechnology patents. Future changes in, or unexpected interpretations of, the patent laws may adversely affect our ability to enforce our patent position. 
In addition, intellectual property rights may be unavailable or of limited effect in some foreign countries. If we do not obtain
sufficient international protection for our intellectual property, our competitiveness in international markets could be impaired, which could limit our growth and revenue.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We also attempt to protect our trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation with security measures, including the use of confidentiality agreements with our employees,
consultants and collaborators. These measures may prove to be ineffective and any remedies available to us may be insufficient to compensate our damages.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Pending and future intellectual property litigation and infringement claims could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling our products. 
A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could adversely affect our growth and

 
profitability, in some cases materially. From time to time, we receive notices from third parties of potential infringement and receive claims of potential infringement. We may be unaware of
intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology. If someone claims that our products infringed their intellectual property rights, any resulting litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the
attention of management and key personnel from other business issues. If we were to lose such litigation involving material intellectual property rights, such loss could result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent our
manufacture and sale of affected products or require us to pay significant royalties in order to continue to manufacture or sell affected products.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Pending and future product liability claims and litigation could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations and impair our reputation. 
Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and
marketing of medical devices. In the ordinary course of business, we are the subject of product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or
product-related information resulted in an unsafe condition or injury to patients. As previously reported, we temporarily suspended the marketing and distribution of our Durom<SUP
STYLE="vertical-align:baseline; position:relative; bottom:.8ex">® Acetabular Component (Durom Cup) in the U.S. in July 2008. Subsequently, a number of product liability lawsuits and other claims have been asserted against us.
We have settled some of these claims and the others are still pending. Additional claims may be asserted in the future. We are also currently defending a number of other product liability lawsuits and claims related to various other products. Any
product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, can be costly to defend. Product liability lawsuits and claims, safety alerts or product recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our
business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers.  Although we maintain third-party product liability
insurance coverage, we have substantial self-insured retention amounts that we must pay in full before obtaining any insurance proceeds to satisfy a judgment or settlement. Furthermore, even if any product liability loss is covered by our insurance,
it is possible that claims against us may exceed the coverage limits of our insurance policies and we would have to pay the amount of any settlement or judgment that is in excess of our policy limits. Product liability claims in excess of applicable
insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  We are
involved in legal proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes.  In addition to intellectual property and product
liability claims and lawsuits, we are involved in various commercial and securities litigation and claims, government investigations and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although we believe
we have substantial defenses in these matters, litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s

view of these matters may change in the future. Given the uncertain nature of legal proceedings generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result
from an unfavorable outcome. We could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period. 
We depend on a limited number of suppliers for some key raw materials and outsourced activities. 
We use a number of suppliers for raw materials that we need to manufacture our products and to outsource some key manufacturing
activities. These suppliers must provide the materials and perform the activities to our standards for us to meet our quality and regulatory requirements. Some key raw materials and outsourced activities can only be obtained from a single source or
a limited number of sources. A prolonged disruption or other inability to obtain these materials or outsource key manufacturing activities could materially and adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products. 
If we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely heavily to market our products, customers may not buy
our products and our revenue and profitability may decline.  Our marketing success in the U.S. and abroad depends
significantly upon our agents’ and distributors’ sales and service expertise in the marketplace. Many of these agents have developed professional relationships with existing and potential customers because of the agents’ detailed
knowledge of products and instruments. A loss of a significant number of these agents could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We may make additional acquisitions or enter into strategic alliances that could increase our costs or liabilities or be disruptive. 
We intend to continue to look for additional strategic acquisitions of other businesses that are complementary to our businesses and other
companies with whom we could form strategic alliances or enter into other arrangements to develop or exploit intellectual property rights. These activities involve risks, including the following: 


•
 
 we may need to divert more management resources to integration than we planned, which may adversely affect our ability to pursue other more profitable
activities; 


•
 
 the difficulties of integrating acquired businesses may be increased if we need to integrate geographically separated organizations, personnel with
disparate business backgrounds and companies with different corporate cultures; 


•
 
 we may not recognize expected cost savings or the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or strategic alliances; 


•
 
 our acquisition candidates or strategic partners may have unexpected liabilities or prove unable to meet their obligations to us or the joint venture;
and 


•
 
 the priorities of our strategic partners may prove incompatible with ours.

 Future material impairments in the carrying value of our intangible assets, including
goodwill, would negatively affect our operating results.  Our assets include intangible assets, primarily goodwill. The
goodwill results from our acquisition activity and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired. We assess at least annually whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable. If the operating performance at one or more of our business units falls significantly below current levels, if competing or alternative technologies emerge, or if market conditions or
future cash flow estimates for one or more of our businesses decline, we could be required, under current U.S. accounting rules, to record a non-cash charge to operating earnings for the amount of the impairment. Any write-off of a material portion
of our unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations.  We may have additional tax
liabilities.  We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required
in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We regularly are under audit by tax authorities.
Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could
have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made.  We earn a
significant amount of our operating income from outside the U.S., and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax rates. In addition, there have been proposals to change U.S. tax laws that
would significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form this proposed legislation will pass, if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax
expense and cash flow.  In May 2011, the IRS concluded its examinations of our U.S. federal returns for years 2005 through 2007
and issued income tax assessments reallocating profits between certain of our U.S. and foreign subsidiaries. We believe that we have followed applicable U.S. tax laws and will vigorously defend our income tax positions. However, the ultimate
resolution of this matter is uncertain and could have a material impact on our income tax expense, results of operations and cash flows for future periods.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">U.S. healthcare reform legislation includes provisions that may adversely affect our business and results of operations.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">As the 2010 U.S. healthcare law continues to be phased in, we believe the law will have an impact on various aspects of our business operations. The 2013 imposition of the 2.3 percent medical device
excise tax is forcing us to identify ways to reduce spending in other areas to offset the increased expense that we will incur because of the tax. We do not

expect to be able to pass along the cost of the tax to hospitals, which continue to face cuts to their Medicare reimbursement per the healthcare law. Nor do we expect to be able to offset the
cost of the tax through higher sales volumes resulting from the expansion of health insurance coverage because of the demographics of the current uninsured population. The level of difficulty in terms of complying with the medical device tax will
depend on the regulations put forth by the U.S. Department of Treasury. In addition, the law’s Medicare payment reforms, such as accountable care organizations and bundled payments, will provide additional incentives for healthcare providers to
reduce spending on our medical device products and reduce utilization of hospital procedures that use our products. Accordingly, while it is still too early to fully understand and predict the ultimate impact of the law on our business, ongoing
implementation of this legislation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.  We are
subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulations on an ongoing basis that could require us to change our business practices and restrict our operations in the future.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Our industry is subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including false claims laws, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, similar state laws and physician
self-referral laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment and, within the U.S., exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including
Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration (VA) health programs. The interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are uncertain and subject to rapid change.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">If third-party payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or reduce reimbursement levels, the demand for our products may decline and our ability to sell our products profitably may be
harmed.  We sell our products and services to hospitals, doctors, dentists and other healthcare providers, all of which
receive reimbursement for the healthcare services provided to their patients from third-party payors, such as domestic and international government programs, private insurance plans and managed care programs. These third-party payors may deny
reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods, as determined by the third-party payor, or was used for an unapproved indication. Third-party payors may also decline to
reimburse for experimental procedures and devices. If our products are not considered cost-effective by third-party payors, our customers may not be reimbursed for our products. 
In addition, third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of
reimbursement for medical products and services. If third-party payors reduce reimbursement levels to hospitals and other healthcare providers for our products, demand for our products may decline, or we may experience increased pressure to reduce
the prices of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.

 We have also experienced downward pressure on product pricing and other effects of
healthcare reform in our international markets. If key participants in government healthcare systems reduce the reimbursement levels for our products, our sales and results of operations may be adversely affected. 
The ongoing cost-containment efforts of healthcare purchasing organizations may have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations.  Many customers for our products have formed group purchasing organizations in an effort to contain costs.
Group purchasing organizations negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors, and these negotiated prices are made available to a group purchasing organization’s affiliated hospitals and other members. If we
are not one of the providers selected by a group purchasing organization, affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to purchase our products, and, if the group purchasing organization has negotiated a strict compliance contract for
another manufacturer’s products, we may be precluded from making sales to members of the group purchasing organization for the duration of the contractual arrangement. Our failure to respond to the cost-containment efforts of group purchasing
organizations may cause us to lose market share to our competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Our success depends on our ability to effectively develop and market our products against those of our competitors.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or
by other therapies, including biological therapies. To remain competitive, we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies. Competition is primarily on the basis of: 


•
 
 technology; 


•
 
 innovation; 


•
 
 quality; 


•
 
 reputation; and 


•
 
 customer service.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In markets outside of the U.S., other factors influence competition as well, including: 


•
 
 local distribution systems; 


•
 
 complex regulatory environments; and 


•
 
 differing medical philosophies and product preferences.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Our competitors may: 


•
 
 have greater financial, marketing and other resources than us; 


•
 
 respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies; 


•
 
 undertake more extensive marketing campaigns; 


•
 
 adopt more aggressive pricing policies; or 


•
 
 be more successful in attracting potential customers, employees and strategic partners. 
Any of these factors, alone or in combination, could cause us to have difficulty maintaining or increasing sales of our products.

 We and our customers are subject to various governmental regulations relating to the
manufacturing, labeling and marketing of our products, and we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop products compatible with these regulations. 
The medical devices we design, develop, manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal,
state and foreign governmental authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in
receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs.  <FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In addition, if we fail to comply with applicable material regulatory requirements, including, for example, the Quality System Regulation, recordkeeping regulations, labeling and promotional requirements
and adverse event reporting regulations, we may be subject to a range of sanctions including: 


•
 
 warning letters; 


•
 
 fines or civil penalties; 


•
 
 injunctions; 


•
 
 repairs, replacements or refunds; 


•
 
 recalls or seizures of products; 


•
 
 total or partial suspension of production; 


•
 
 the FDA’s refusal to grant future premarket clearances or approvals; 


•
 
 withdrawals or suspensions of current product applications; and 


•
 
 criminal prosecution.

 Moreover, the FDA recently issued several guidance documents that may impact the amount of
data required for 510(k) clearance of new products. The guidance documents may also require additional submissions for minor changes to products currently on the market, where none were required in the past. Additionally, reauthorization
of the Medical Device User Fee Act, to be completed by September 30, 2012, may lead to additional post-market requirements for certain 510(k) products. We expect these 510(k)-related changes could delay new products from reaching the
market in the U.S. and increase the costs of introducing new products and features, which could adversely affect our business. 
Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, such as the International Standards
Organization. If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our business could be harmed.
