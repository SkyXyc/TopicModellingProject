General. Cable network programming is a highly competitive business.

Important competitive factors include the prices charged for programming, the quantity, quality and variety of programming offered and the effectiveness of marketing efforts. 
FOX News. FOX News Channel’s primary competition comes from the cable networks CNN, HLN (CNN’s Headline News), and MSNBC. Fox Business Network’s primary competition comes from the cable networks CNBC and Bloomberg Television. FOX News Channel and FOX Business Network also compete for viewers and 
8


 
advertisers within a broad spectrum of television networks, including other non-news cable networks and free-to-air broadcast television networks. 
Sports programming operations. A number of basic and pay television programming services, such as ESPN and NBC Sports Network, as well as free-to-air stations and broadcast networks, provide programming that also targets Fox Sports 1, Fox Sports 2 and the FSN RSNs’ respective audience. On a national level, the primary competitors to Fox Sports 1, Fox Sports 2 and FSN are ESPN, ESPN2, NBC Sports Network and CBS Sports Net. In regional markets, the FSN RSNs compete with other regional sports networks, including those operated by team owners, cable television systems, local broadcast television stations and other sports programming providers and distributors. Fox Sports 1, Fox Sports 2 and FSN also face competition online from Major League Baseball Advanced Media, Yahoo Sports, ESPN.com, NBCSports.com and CBSSports.com, among others.
In addition, Fox Sports 1, Fox Sports 2, the FSN RSNs and FSN compete, to varying degrees, for sports programming rights. The FSN RSNs compete for local and regional rights with local broadcast television stations, other local and regional sports networks, including sports networks launched by team owners, and distribution outlets, such as cable television systems. Fox Sports 1, Fox Sports 2 and FSN compete for national rights principally with a number of national cable and broadcast services that specialize in or carry sports programming, including sports networks launched by the leagues and conferences, and television “superstations” that distribute sports. Independent syndicators also compete by acquiring and reselling such rights nationally, regionally and locally. Distribution outlets, such as cable television systems, sometimes contract directly with the sports teams in their service area for the right to distribute a number of those teams’ games on their systems. In certain markets, the owners of distribution outlets, such as cable television systems, also own one or more of the professional teams in the region, increasing their ability to launch competing networks and also limiting the professional sports rights available for acquisition by FSN RSNs. 
FX and FXX. FX and FXX face competition from a number of basic cable and pay television programming services, such as USA Network (“USA”), TNT, Spike TV, Home Box Office, Inc. (“HBO”) and Showtime Networks (“Showtime”), as well as free-to-air broadcast networks and Internet subscription and rental services that provide programming that targets the same viewing audience as FX and FXX. FX and FXX also face competition from these programming services in the acquisition of distribution rights to movie and series programming. 
National Geographic U.S. National Geographic Channel and Nat Geo Wild face competition for viewers and advertising from a number of basic cable and broadcast television channels, such as Discovery Channel, History Channel, Animal Planet, Travel Channel, Science Channel, H2, Military Channel, Biography and Tru TV, as well as free-to-air broadcast networks and sports, news and general entertainment networks which have acquired or produced competing programming. 
FIC. Internationally, the Company’s cable businesses compete with various local and foreign television services providers and distribution networks for audiences, advertising, content acquisition and distribution platforms. 
STAR India. In India, the pay television broadcasting industry has several participants, and STAR India’s entertainment channels compete with both pay and free-to-air channels since they are delivered by common cable, direct-to-home and IPTV. STAR India also competes in India to acquire Hindi and other Indian languages film and programming rights, and internationally for English film and programming rights.

(a) 

VHF television stations transmit on Channels 2 through 13 and UHF television stations on Channels 14 through 51. The Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) applies a discount (the “UHF Discount”) which attributes only 50% of the television households in a local television market to the audience reach of a UHF television station for purposes of calculating whether that station’s owner complies with the national station ownership cap imposed by FCC regulations and by statute; in making this calculation, only the station’s actual (digital) broadcast channel is considered. In addition, the coverage of two commonly owned stations in the same market is counted only once. The percentages listed are rounded and do not take into account the UHF Discount. For more information regarding the FCC’s national station ownership cap, see “Government Regulation—Television” in this Annual Report.

In June 2014, Fox Television Stations entered into an agreement to acquire two San Francisco-Bay area television stations from CMG in exchange for the Fox Television Stations’ FOX affiliated stations WHBQ-TV FOX 13 and WFXT-TV FOX 24, located in the Memphis and Boston markets, respectively. After the closing, CMG will continue to operate the Boston and Memphis stations as FOX Affiliates. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.

FOX Broadcasting Company (“FOX”) 
FOX has 205 FOX Affiliates, including 18 stations owned and operated by the Company, which reach approximately 99% of all U.S. television households. In general, each week FOX regularly delivers to its affiliates 15 hours of prime-time programming and 60 minutes of late-night programming on Saturday. FOX’s prime-time entertainment programming features such series as New Girl, Sleepy Hollow, The Following, The Simpsons, and Glee; unscripted series such as American Idol, Hell’s Kitchen and So You Think You Can Dance; event series such as 24: Live Another Day; and various specials. In addition, a significant component of FOX’s programming consists of sports programming, with FOX providing to its affiliates live coverage (including post-season) of the National Football Conference of the National Football League (the “NFL”) and MLB, as well as live coverage of the Sprint Cup Series of the NASCAR, college football and basketball, UFC and international soccer, including, beginning in 2015, the FIFA Women’s World Cup. FOX also airs a two-hour block of direct response programming on Saturday mornings provided by Worldlink Ventures (“Worldlink”), a media sales firm. FOX’s agreement with Worldlink extends through the 2014-2015 broadcast season. 
FOX’s prime-time line-up is intended to appeal primarily to target audiences of 18 to 49-year old adults, the demographic group that advertisers seek to reach most often, with an emphasis on the difficult to reach 18 to 34-year old adult demographic coveted by advertisers. During the 2013-2014 traditional September to May broadcast season, FOX ranked first (tied with NBC broadcast network (“NBC”)) in prime-time programming among adults ages 18 to 34 and second in prime-time programming based on viewership of adults ages 18 to 49 (based on Live+7 ratings). This is the 12th consecutive year FOX has ranked first among adults ages 18 to 34 (2002-2003 to 2013-2014) and the 14th consecutive year FOX has ranked first among teens ages 12 to 17 (2000-2001 to 2013-2014). FOX has ranked first among adults ages 18 to 49 eight out of the past 10 years. The median age of the FOX viewer is 49 years, as compared to 52 years for NBC, 53 years for ABC Television Network (“ABC”) and 57 years for CBS Television Network (“CBS”). 
FOX obtains programming from major television studios and independent television production companies pursuant to license agreements. The terms of those agreements generally provide FOX with the right to broadcast a television series for a minimum of four seasons.
National sports programming is obtained through license agreements with professional or collegiate sports leagues or organizations. FOX’s current licenses with the NFL, MLB, college football conferences, NASCAR, FIFA and UFC are secured by long-term agreements, including a new long-term agreement with the USGA with events on FOX beginning in 2015. 
FOX provides programming to the FOX Affiliates in accordance with affiliation agreements of varying durations, which grant to each affiliate the right to broadcast network television programming on the affiliated station. Such agreements typically run three or more years and have staggered expiration dates. These affiliation agreements generally require FOX Affiliates to carry FOX programming in all time periods in which FOX programming is offered to those affiliates, subject to certain exceptions stated in the affiliation agreements. 
FOX also distributes programming through its network-branded website and FoxNow application and licenses programming for distribution through the websites and applications of cable television systems, direct broadcast satellite operators, telecommunications companies and online video distributors. 
In addition, FOX produces multi-platform original dramatic series and original online animated series and shorts under its Animation Domination High-Def brand.

MyNetworkTV 
The programming distribution service, Master Distribution Service, Inc. (branded as MyNetworkTV), distributes two hours per night, Monday through Friday, of original and off- network programming from Twentieth Television and other third party syndicators to its licensee stations. As of June 30, 2014, MyNetworkTV had license and delivery agreements covering 182 stations, including 10 stations owned and operated by the Company, reaching approximately 96% of U.S. households. 
Competition. The network television broadcasting business is highly competitive. FOX and MyNetworkTV compete with other broadcast networks, such as ABC, NBC, CBS and The CW Television Network, independent television stations, cable and direct broadcast satellite (“DBS”) program services, as well as other media, including DVDs, Blu-rays, digital video recorders (“DVR”), video games, print and the Internet for audiences, programming and, in the case of FOX, advertising revenues. In addition, FOX and MyNetworkTV compete with other broadcast networks and other programming distribution services to secure affiliations or station agreements with independently owned television stations in markets across the United States. ABC, NBC and CBS each broadcasts a significantly greater number of hours of programming than FOX and, accordingly, may be able to designate or change time periods in which programming is to be broadcast with greater flexibility than FOX. In addition, future technological developments may affect competition within the television marketplace. 
Each of the stations owned and operated by Fox Television Stations also competes for advertising revenues with other television stations and radio and cable systems in its respective market area, along with other advertising media, such as newspapers, magazines, outdoor advertising, direct mail and Internet websites. All of the stations owned and operated by Fox Television Stations are located in highly competitive markets. Additional elements that are material to the competitive position of each of the television stations include management experience, authorized power and assigned frequency of that station. Competition for sales of broadcast advertising time is based primarily on the anticipated and actually delivered size and demographic characteristics of audiences as determined by various rating services, price, the time of day when the advertising is to be broadcast, competition from the other broadcast networks, cable television systems, DBS services and other media and general economic conditions. Competition for audiences is based primarily on the selection of programming, the acceptance of which is dependent on the reaction of the viewing public, which is often difficult to predict. 
Filmed Entertainment 
The Company is engaged in the production and acquisition of live-action and animated motion pictures for distribution and licensing in all formats in all entertainment media worldwide, and the production and licensing of television programming worldwide. 
Motion Picture Production and Distribution 
One of the world’s largest producers and distributors of motion pictures, Twentieth Century Fox Film (“TCFF”) produces, acquires and distributes motion pictures throughout the world under a variety of arrangements. During fiscal 2014, TCFF placed 24 motion pictures in general release in the United States. The motion pictures of TCFF are produced and/or distributed by the following units of TCFF: Twentieth Century Fox and Fox 2000, which produce and acquire motion pictures for mainstream audiences; Fox Searchlight Pictures, which produces and acquires specialized motion pictures; and Twentieth Century Fox Animation, which produces feature length animated motion pictures. In addition, Fox International Productions, Inc. co-produces, co-finances and acquires local-language motion pictures intended for distribution outside the United States. The motion pictures produced and/or distributed by TCFF in the United States and international territories in fiscal 2014 included The Wolverine, 12 Years a Slave, The Grand Budapest Hotel, Rio 2, The Other Woman, X-Men: Days of Future Past, The Fault in Our Stars and How To Train Your Dragon 2. TCFF has already released or currently plans to release approximately 26 motion pictures in the United States in fiscal 2015, including Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Gone Girl, Exodus, The Penguins of Madagascar, Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb, Taken 3, Spy, The Fantastic Four, Wild and Best Exotic Marigold Hotel 2. Pursuant to an agreement with Monarchy Enterprises Holdings B.V. (“MEH”), the parent company of New Regency in which the Company has a 20% interest, and certain of MEH’s subsidiaries, TCFF distributes certain New Regency films and all films co-financed by TCFF and New Regency in all media 
13


 
worldwide, excluding a number of international territories with respect to television rights. Among its fiscal 2015 releases, TCFF currently expects to distribute three New Regency films. 
The Company has an arrangement with DreamWorks Animation SKG, Inc. (“DWA”) to distribute new release animated motion pictures produced by DWA, as well as certain other library motion pictures and programming controlled by DWA, domestically and internationally in all media including theatrical, all home media formats and certain forms of television. Among TCFF’s fiscal 2015 releases, TCFF currently expects to distribute three DWA films. 
Motion picture companies, such as TCFF, typically seek to generate revenues from various distribution channels. TCFF derives its worldwide revenues from motion pictures and other program distribution primarily from four basic sources (set forth in general chronology of exploitation): (i) distribution of motion pictures for theatrical exhibition in the United States and Canada and markets outside of the United States and Canada (“international” markets); (ii) distribution of motion pictures and other programming in various home media formats, including digital distribution; (iii) distribution of motion pictures and other programming for exhibition on premium pay and subscription video-on-demand (“SVOD”); and (iv) distribution of motion pictures and other programming for exhibition on free television networks, other broadcast program services, independent television stations and basic cable programming services, including certain services which are affiliates of the Company. The Company does not always have rights in all media of exhibition to all motion pictures that it releases, and does not necessarily distribute a given motion picture in all of the foregoing media in all markets. The Company believes that the pre-release marketing of a feature film is an integral part of its motion picture distribution strategy and generally begins marketing efforts three to six months in advance of a film’s release date in any given territory. The Company markets and distributes its films worldwide principally through its own distribution and marketing companies. 
Through Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment LLC and TCFF, the Company distributes motion pictures and other programming produced by units of TCFF, its affiliates and other producers in the United States, Canada and international markets in all home media formats, including the sale and rental of DVDs and Blu-rays. In fiscal 2014, the domestic home entertainment division released or re-released approximately 1,249 produced and acquired titles, including 19 new TCFF film releases, approximately 867 catalog titles and approximately 363 television and non-theatrical titles. In international markets, the Company distributed, produced and acquired titles both directly and through foreign distribution channels, with approximately 1,004 releases in fiscal 2014, including approximately 20 new TCFF film releases, approximately 723 catalog titles and approximately 261 television and non-theatrical releases. The Company enters into domestic and international license arrangements with third parties for distribution by electronic sell-through (“EST”), video-on-demand (“VOD”) and/or pay-per-view (“PPV”). Distribution on an EST basis enables consumers to acquire the right to retain programs on a permanent basis. The EST, VOD and PPV arrangements generally provide for license fees based on a percentage of the licensee’s gross receipts received from consumers and in some cases a guaranteed minimum fee per consumer transaction. In addition, these arrangements generally provide for a minimum number of scheduled PPV exhibitions per program and for continuous VOD availability of each program to consumers during a fixed period. In fiscal 2014, the Company continued its arrangement to distribute new release animated motion pictures produced by DWA as well as certain other catalog motion pictures and programming controlled by DWA. In fiscal 2014, the Company continued its worldwide home video distribution arrangement with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (“MGM”), releasing approximately 520 MGM home entertainment theatrical, catalog and television programs domestically and 558 internationally. The Company also continued its domestic home video distribution arrangements with Lions Gate Films Inc. (“Lions Gate”) (U.S. only) and Anchor Bay Entertainment, LLC (“Anchor Bay”) (U.S. and Canada), releasing approximately 1,536 Lions Gate home entertainment theatrical, catalog and television programs and approximately 696 Anchor Bay home entertainment theatrical, catalog and television programs. During fiscal 2014, the domestic home entertainment division released 441 Blu-ray titles, including 19 new TCFF film releases, 350 catalog titles and 72 television and non-theatrical releases. In international markets, the Company released 326 Blu-ray titles, including 20 new TCFF film releases and 306 catalog titles. The Company also distributed 181 Blu-ray titles from MGM domestically and 127 titles internationally, 313 Blu-ray titles from Lions Gate domestically, and 169 Blu-ray titles from Anchor Bay domestically. 
Units of TCFF license motion pictures and other programming in the United States and international markets to various third party and certain affiliated subscription pay television and SVOD services as well as to free television networks and basic cable programming services for distribution by means of various media, which may 
14


 
include DBS, cable television systems and the Internet. The license agreements reflecting the subscription pay television arrangements generally provide for a specified number of exhibitions of the program during a fixed term in exchange for a license fee that is based on a variety of factors, including the box office performance of each program and the number of subscribers to the service or system. Among third party license arrangements that units of TCFF have in place in the United States for subscription pay television exhibition of motion pictures is an exclusive license agreement with HBO, providing for the licensing of films initially released for theatrical exhibition. Units of TCFF also license programming to SVOD services in the United States. Such licenses enable the consumer to view individual programming selected by the viewer for a subscription fee, typically on a monthly basis. In international markets, units of TCFF license motion pictures and other programming to subscription pay television and SVOD services operated by leading third parties, as well as to such services operated by various affiliated entities. In addition, units of TCFF license motion pictures and other programming in international markets for exhibition on free television networks, including basic cable programming services, both to independent third party broadcasters as well as to services operated by affiliated entities of the Company. 
Competition. Motion picture production and distribution are highly competitive businesses. The Company competes with other film studios, independent production companies and others for the acquisition of artistic properties, the services of creative and technical personnel, exhibition outlets and the public’s interest in its products. The number of motion pictures released by the Company’s competitors, particularly the other major film studios, in any given period may create an oversupply of product in the market, which may reduce the Company’s shares of gross box office admissions and may make it more difficult for the Company’s motion pictures to succeed. The commercial success of the motion pictures produced and/or distributed by the Company is affected substantially by the public’s unpredictable response to them. The competitive risks affecting the Company’s home entertainment business include the number of home entertainment titles released by the Company’s competitors that may create an oversupply of product in the market, competition among home media formats, such as DVDs and Blu-rays, and other methods of distribution, such as EST and VOD services. 
The Company faces ongoing risks associated with controlling unauthorized copying and distribution of the Company’s programs. For a further discussion of issues relating to unauthorized copying and distribution of the Company’s programs, see “—Intellectual Property.” 
Television Programming, Production and Domestic Syndication Distribution 
Twentieth Century Fox Television (“TCFTV”). During fiscal 2014, TCFTV produced television programs for FOX, FX, ABC, CBS, NBC and Netflix. TCFTV currently produces, or has orders to produce, episodes of the following television series: Backstrom, Bob’s Burgers, Bones, Bordertown, Empire, Family Guy, Glee, The Last Man on Earth, New Girl, The Simpsons, Sleepy Hollow and Weird Loners for FOX; American Horror Story for FX; Cristela, Fresh Off the Boat, Last Man Standing and Modern Family for ABC; and American Dad for Turner Broadcasting System. Generally, a television network or cable network will license a specified number of episodes for exhibition during the license period. All other distribution rights, including international and off-network syndication rights, are typically retained by TCFTV, utilized by other units of the Company or sold to third parties. 
Fox 21, Inc. (“Fox 21”). Fox 21 produces television programs for major U.S. cable networks. The company produces Sons of Anarchy and Tyrant for FX; Homeland for Showtime; Brickleberry for Comedy Partners; Salem for WGN America; Legends for TNT, Witches of East End for Lifetime; and Rush for USA.
Television programs generally are produced under contracts that provide for license fees that may cover only a portion of the anticipated production costs. As these costs have increased in recent years, the resulting deficit between production costs and license fees for domestic first-run programming also has increased. Therefore, additional licensing is often critical to the financial success of a series. Successful U.S. network television series are typically (i) licensed for first-run exhibition in international markets, (ii) released in DVD and Blu-ray box sets, (iii) made available for EST, including individual episodes and full series, (iv) licensed for VOD, PPV and SVOD services, including individual episodes and full series, (v) licensed for off-network exhibition in the United States (including in syndication and to cable programmers) and (vi) licensed for further television exhibition in international markets. Typically, a series must be broadcast for at least three to four television seasons for there to be a sufficient number of episodes to offer the series in syndication or to cable and DBS programmers in the United 
15


 
States. The decision of a television network to continue a series through an entire television season or to renew a series for another television season depends largely on the series’ audience ratings. 
Twentieth Television. Twentieth Television licenses both television programming and feature films for domestic syndication to television stations and basic cable services in the United States. Twentieth Television distributes a program portfolio that includes the Company’s library of television and film assets, and first-run programming produced by its production companies for sales to local stations, including stations owned and operated by the Company, as well as to basic cable networks. First-run programs distributed by Twentieth Television include the court show Divorce Court and the entertainment magazine program Dish Nation. 
Twentieth Television derives revenue from off-network, theatrical and first-run program sales in the form of cash license fees paid by both broadcast and cable licensees, and from the sales of national advertising units retained by Twentieth Television in its programs. Twentieth Television licenses such shows as Modern Family, Archer, It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Burn Notice, Family Guy, The Simpsons, Bones, How I Met Your Mother, The Cleveland Show, Bob’s Burgers, Glee and The Simpsons to cable and broadcast networks. Twentieth Television also sells national advertising on behalf of other third party syndicators. 
Fox Television Studios (“FtvS”). FtvS is a program supplier to the major U.S. and international broadcast and cable networks. FtvS is currently producing the series White Collar, Graceland, Sirens and Complications for USA, The Americans and The Comedians for FX, The Killing for Netflix and Maron for IFC. 
Shine Limited (“Shine”). Shine is an international television production and distribution group with 26 operating companies across 11 countries creating and exploiting scripted and non-scripted content in the global marketplace. Shine companies include award-winning genre specialists such as U.K.-based Kudos (drama), Dragonfly (factual), Princess Productions (entertainment and multi-genre) and Shine TV (factual and factual entertainment); U.S. producer Shine America (formerly Reveille); and Shine Nordics (previously Metronome Film & Television), the Nordic region’s largest production group. The group also includes Shine 360°, a group-wide global brand and commercial rights division, and Shine International, its dedicated international distribution arm. Shine International distributes a catalogue of approximately 3,800 hours of broadcast content to 265 territories worldwide as of the end of fiscal 2014. Internationally distributed shows from the Shine group include MasterChef (now sold for adaptation in 52 territories), The Biggest Loser, and dramas The Bridge and Broadchurch which is being remade in the U.S. as Gracepoint. Shine has established businesses in Germany, France, Australia, Spain and Portugal. Shine also has a digital and direct to consumer business through its multi-platform game producer Bossa Studios and its online original content producer and YouTube multi-channel network, ChannelFlip Media.
In May 2014, the Company and certain funds managed by Apollo Global Management (“Apollo”) entered into a preliminary agreement, subject to a number of conditions, to form a joint venture with Apollo to combine three leading creators, producers and distributors of multiplatform entertainment: Shine, Endemol and Core Media Group. The new joint venture will be jointly owned and managed by the Company and Apollo. There can be no assurance that the proposed transaction will be completed.
Competition. Similar to motion picture production and distribution, production and distribution of television programming is extremely competitive. The Company competes with other film studios, independent production companies and others for the acquisition of artistic properties, the services of creative and technical personnel, exhibition outlets and the public’s interest in its products. In addition, television networks have affiliated production companies from which they are increasingly obtaining their programming, which has reduced the demand for programming from other non-affiliated parties. 
Motion Picture and Television Library 
The Company’s motion picture and television library (the “Fox Library”) consists of varying ownership and distribution rights to several thousand previously released motion pictures and many well-known television programs. Motion pictures in the Fox Library include many successful and well-known titles, such as The Sound of Music, Mrs. Doubtfire, Home Alone, the Star Wars series, the X-Men series, Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow, the Ice Age series, The Planet of the Apes series, Sideways, Walk the Line, The Devil Wears Prada, Little Miss Sunshine, the Night at the Museum series, the Alvin and the Chipmunks series, Slumdog Millionaire, Life of Pi 
16


 
and Taken, as well as four of the top 20 domestic box office grossing films of all time, which are Avatar, Titanic (together with Paramount Pictures Corporation), Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope and Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. 
The Fox Library contains varying ownership and distribution rights to many television series and made-for-television motion pictures. The television programming in the Fox Library consists of such classic series as 24, How I Met Your Mother, King of the Hill, Prison Break, Boston Legal, My Name is Earl, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, M*A*S*H, Hill Street Blues, Doogie Howser, M.D., L.A. Law, The Wonder Years, The Practice, Ally McBeal, Angel, Dharma & Greg, In Living Color, The X-Files, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Cleveland Show, Arrested Development, Futurama, Raising Hope and NYPD Blue, as well as prior seasons of such current series as The Simpsons, Bones, Family Guy, Glee, Modern Family, Sons of Anarchy, New Girl, Last Man Standing and American Dad. 
Direct Broadcast Satellite Television 
The Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sky Italia, and its majority-owned subsidiary, Sky Deutschland, engages in the broadcast service business directly to subscribers in Italy (in the case of Sky Italia) and Germany and Austria (in the case of Sky Deutschland). The Company also owns a significant equity interest in BSkyB, which is engaged in the DBS business (for a description of the business of BSkyB, please see discussion under heading “Equity Interests”). 
Sky Italia 
Sky Italia currently distributes more than 170 channels of basic, premium and pay-per-view programming services via satellite and broadband directly to subscribers in Italy. This programming includes exclusive rights to popular sporting events, newly-released movies and Sky Italia’s original programming, such as SKY TG 24, Italy’s first 24-hour news channel. As of June 30, 2014, Sky Italia had approximately 4.73 million subscribers. 
Sky Deutschland 
In January 2013, the Company increased to 55% its ownership in Sky Deutschland, the leading pay television operator in Germany and Austria.

As of June 30, 2014, Sky Deutschland had approximately 3.81 million subscribers. 
Combination of European Satellite Television Holdings
In July 2014, the Company entered into agreements with BSkyB to sell its 100% and 57% (on a fully diluted basis) ownership stakes in Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland, respectively. As consideration for the transfer, the Company will receive approximately $9.3 billion (based on foreign currency exchange rates as of the date of the agreements) in value from BSkyB, including approximately $8.6 billion in cash. The agreements are subject to regulatory approvals, the approval of BSkyB stockholders and customary closing conditions. The Company will remain engaged in the DBS business through its approximate 39% interest in BSkyB, which is more fully described under the heading “Recent Developments.”
Competition. Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland compete with companies that offer video, audio, interactive programming, telephony, data and other information and entertainment services, including broadcasters of free-to-air television channels, broadband Internet providers, digital terrestrial transmission (“DTT”) services, wireless companies and companies that are developing new media technologies.

Government Regulation 
General 
Various aspects of the Company’s activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world. The Company believes that it is in material compliance with the requirements imposed by those laws and regulations described herein. The introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the Company’s products and services are produced or distributed (and changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries) could have a negative impact on the interests of the Company. 
Cable Network Programming and Direct Broadcast Satellite Television 
Asia. The Company broadcasts television programming over a “footprint” covering approximately 53 Asian countries. Most countries in which the Company operates have a regulatory framework for the satellite and cable television industry. Government regulation of direct reception and redistribution via cable or other means of satellite television signals, where it is addressed at all, is treated differently in each country. At one extreme are absolute bans on private ownership of satellite receiving equipment. Some countries, however, have adopted a less restrictive approach, opting to allow ownership of satellite receiving equipment by certain institutions and individuals but allowing them to receive only authorized broadcasts. At the opposite end of the spectrum are countries where private satellite dish ownership is allowed and laws and regulations have been adopted which support popular access to satellite services through local cable redistribution. 
Most television services within Asia, whether free-to-air or pay television, are also subject to licensing requirements. In addition, most countries in which the Company operates control the content offered by local broadcast operators through censorship requirements to which program suppliers, such as the Company, are subject. Certain countries also require a minimum percentage of local content. Other countries require local broadcast operators to obtain government approval to retransmit foreign programming. 
Additional categories of regulation of actual or potential significance to the Company are restrictions on foreign investment in distribution platforms, television programming production, limitations on exclusive arrangements for channel distribution and non-discrimination requirements for supply or carriage of programming and anti-competition or anti-trust legislation. Such restrictions are different in each country. 
India. In India, private satellite dish ownership, including DTH, is allowed. Television viewers receive broadcast television signals primarily through terrestrial and cable delivery and, in more recent years, through DTH and IPTV delivery. Terrestrial broadcasting remains the domain of government-owned broadcast stations. 
All cable television operators are required to carry certain government-operated channels. Retransmissions of foreign satellite channels, such as STAR India’s channels, are permitted, subject to licensing requirements and compliance with local applicable laws, including programming and advertisement codes. The Indian government requires that all film and media content, whether produced in India or abroad, be certified by the Central Board of Film Certification prior to exhibition in India and also places certain restrictions on advertising content. The Indian Broadcasting Foundation has issued Self Regulatory Guidelines that apply to the programming on non-news and current affairs channels. 
Certain wholesale and retail channel tariffs are under review after intervention by the Indian courts. While there is no tariff regulation for DTH at the retail level, broadcasters are required under an interim order by the court to offer their channels to DTH platforms at 42% of the rates charged to analog cable. Broadcasters are also required to provide their channels on non-discriminatory terms to all distributors if no carriage charges are being sought from broadcasters. In 2011, the Cable Television Act was amended and new rules were issued mandating that cable networks switch from analog to digital systems. The TRAI issued rules that mandated, among other things, basic service tiers comprised of free-to-air channels be compulsorily offered to consumers. This new regime, which will bring digital cable pricing in line with DTH, is expected to be fully implemented by the end of calendar year 2014. The TRAI has recently enacted a 27.5% increase in channel rates that will be implemented by January 1, 2015.

The TRAI enacted new regulations in March 2013, which limit the amount of advertising time allowed on television channels. These new regulations replace the regulations enacted by the TRAI in May 2012 which had been challenged in the Indian courts. The March 2013 regulations have also been challenged and such challenges are currently pending in the Indian courts. 
The Indian government has mandated sports content rights owners to simultaneously share a feed free of advertisements of the live broadcasting signal of sporting events of national importance with the Indian government owned broadcaster to enable it to re-transmit the signal on its terrestrial networks and DTH networks. For such shared events, the regulations also provide for sharing of advertising revenue, 75% to the content rights owners and 25% to the government owned broadcaster.
The Copyright laws in India were amended in June 2012 to provide, inter alia, for rights to receive royalties for authors of underlying work and to permit broadcasters to access content under a statutory license at royalty rates to be determined by the Copyright Board. 
Latin America. The Company broadcasts television programming throughout approximately 18 Latin American countries, as well as the Caribbean. Certain countries in which the Company operates have a regulatory framework for the satellite and cable television industry. These regulations vary in each country as does their impact on the Company’s business. In Argentina, the government imposes restrictions on the ability to effectuate price increases on rates charged to pay TV operators and has also implemented certain measures in currency exchange controls which have caused significant impediments and limitations to any person or entity moving money out of the country resulting in exposure to currency devaluation. Pay TV operators are required to carry certain government operated channels. Argentina regulations reduced the available advertising inventory on the channels by half to six minutes and impose a withholding tax on advertisers purchasing advertising inventory on international channels. The Company continues to work to minimize the impact of the reduction of advertising inventory and tax implications on advertisers. In Mexico, international programmers were granted a temporary injunction which allowed them the right to transmit up to an average of 12 minutes per hour of advertising within a 24 hour period, however a new law was recently passed that could require compliance with a six minute per hour limitation. In Brazil, regulations require, among other things: (i) that all channels distributed in the region contain at least three hours and thirty minutes per week of Brazilian content during prime time hours, an increase from the previous requirement of two hours and twenty minutes per week, half of which must be produced by a Brazilian independent producer; (ii) registration of all channels, programmers, local content and advertisements; (iii) website disclosure of programming and advertising content to ensure compliance with tax and other regulations; and (iv) mediation of local agency requirements and taxation on all advertising that is contracted abroad. While such tax shall primarily be paid by advertisers, programmers are ultimately responsible for the tax payment, and failure by advertisers to pay the required tax could subject programmers to fines or penalties. Compliance with these regulations increases the cost of doing business by imposing additional production/acquisition costs as well as third party administrative and legal expenses. 
Europe. The sectors in which the Company operates in Europe are subject to both general competition laws and sector specific regulation. The regulatory regime applicable to the electronic communications and broadcasting sectors is, to a large extent, based on European Union (“EU”) law comprised in various EU directives that require EU member states to adopt national legislation to give effect to the directives’ objectives, while leaving the precise manner and form of the national legislation to the discretion of each member state. The Electronic Communications Directives regulate the provision of communication services, including networks and transmission services that are involved in the broadcasting of television services as well as the provisions of services and facilities associated with the operation of digital television platforms. The AudioVisual Media Services Directive sets out the basic principles for the regulation of television broadcasting activity, including broadcasting licensing, advertising and content regulation and imposes production and investment quotas, obligations to transmit European content for at least 50% of the day and limitations on advertising time. Each European country also has the right to adopt more strict rules. 
In January 2014, the European Commission (“EC”) initiated formal antitrust proceedings to examine certain provisions in licensing agreements between several U.S. film studios, including Twentieth Century Fox, and a number of European pay-TV broadcasters, including Sky Italia, Sky Deutschland and BSkyB. The EC is investigating whether provisions which prevent broadcasters from providing their services across borders, for 
20


 
example by refusing potential subscribers from other EU countries or blocking cross-border access to their services, may constitute breach of EU law. It is not possible to predict the timing or outcome of the EC’s proceedings or the impact on the Company’s business.
Television 
In general, the television broadcast industry in the United States is highly regulated by federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies, including the FCC. The FCC regulates television broadcasting, and certain aspects of the operations of cable, satellite and other electronic media that compete with broadcasting, pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”). 
The Communications Act permits the operation of television broadcast stations only in accordance with a license issued by the FCC upon a finding that the grant of the license would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity. The FCC grants television broadcast station licenses for specific periods of time and, upon application, may renew the licenses for additional terms. Under the Communications Act, television broadcast licenses may be granted for a maximum permitted term of eight years. Generally, the FCC renews broadcast licenses upon finding that: (i) the television station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity; (ii) there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or FCC rules and regulations; and (iii) there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or FCC rules and regulations which, taken together, indicate a pattern of abuse. After considering these factors, the FCC may grant the license renewal application with or without conditions, including renewal for a lesser term than the maximum otherwise permitted, or hold an evidentiary hearing. Fox Television Stations has pending renewal applications for a number of its television station licenses. Seven of the pending applications have been opposed by third parties. On June 13, 2007 and May 15, 2008, Fox Television Stations entered into agreements with the FCC that preclude it from objecting, on the grounds that such action is barred by certain statutes of limitations, to FCC or other governmental action relating to (i) petitions to deny or complaints that have been filed against several owned and operated stations relating to programming that is alleged to violate the prohibition against indecent broadcasts or (ii) inquiries from the FCC regarding compliance with its sponsorship identification rules. For information on the television stations owned and operated by the Company, see “—Fox Television Stations” above. 
In March 2010, the FCC delivered its national Broadband Plan to Congress, which reviews the nation’s broadband Internet infrastructure and recommends a number of initiatives to spur broadband deployment and use. In order to free up more spectrum for wireless broadband services, the Broadband Plan proposes to make spectrum available, including 120 megahertz of broadcast spectrum, by incentivizing current private-sector spectrum holders to return some of their spectrum to the government by 2015 through such initiatives as voluntary “incentive” spectrum auctions (with current licensees permitted to share in the auction proceeds) and “repacking” of channel assignments to increase efficient spectrum usage. If voluntary measures fail to yield the amount of spectrum the FCC deems necessary for wireless broadband deployment, the Broadband Plan proposes various mandates to reclaim spectrum, such as forced channel sharing. In response to the Broadband Plan, Congress passed legislation in February 2012 authorizing the FCC to conduct voluntary auctions of television broadcast station spectrum. Stations that continue their operations may have to change channels once the FCC “repacks” broadcast spectrum. The legislation requires the FCC to assist stations in retaining their current coverage areas, provides that no stations will be forced into the VHF band and establishes a fund to reimburse broadcasters for reasonable channel relocation expenses. The FCC is taking steps to implement the legislation and has said that it expects to conduct the voluntary auction in mid-2015. The FCC also has announced a plan to “repack” the television broadcast stations that do not participate in the auction over the subsequent 39 months; the FCC indicated that it will use reasonable efforts to try to preserve stations’ current coverage areas. The broadcast industry is exploring additional uses for currently allocated spectrum. In April 2010, Fox Television Stations and eleven other major broadcast station group owners formed Mobile Content Venture (“MCV”), a joint venture to develop a new national mobile content service utilizing the stations’ digital broadcast spectrum. MCV launched DyleTM mobile television service, which is currently in 37 markets. It is expected that FCC auctions and repacking will involve multiple rulemaking proceedings and may take several years to complete. It is not possible to predict the timing or outcome of implementation of the Broadband Plan, FCC spectrum auctions and repacking, or their effect on the Company. 
On December 22, 2011, the FCC commenced the next quadrennial review of its broadcast ownership regulations required by the 1996 Telecom Act, proposing only minor modifications to its rules. That review was 
21


 
never completed. In early 2014 the FCC announced its intention to combine the 2011 review with the quadrennial review scheduled for 2014. In the 2014 review, which is pending, the FCC again proposed minor modifications that are not likely to affect the impact of the FCC ownership rules on the Company’s ownership of media properties. 
Fox Television Stations is in compliance with the rules governing ownership of multiple stations in the same market and with the national station ownership cap established by Congress. In September 2013, the FCC commenced a proceeding to consider elimination of the so-called “UHF discount” under which UHF stations are attributed with only 50% of the television households in their markets for purposes of calculating compliance with the national station ownership cap. If the FCC decides to eliminate the UHF discount it may affect the Company’s ability to acquire television stations in additional markets. It is not possible to predict the timing or outcome of the pending proceeding.
Fox Television Stations owns two television stations in the New York DMA. By virtue of its common ownership with News Corp due to the Murdoch Family Trust’s ownership interest in both News Corp and the Company, Fox Television Stations also retains an attributable interest in The New York Post, a daily newspaper in the New York DMA. On October 6, 2006, the FCC reaffirmed the Company’s permanent waiver of the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule, which allows the common ownership of the Post and WNYW(TV), and granted a two-year temporary waiver of the rule to continue to allow the common ownership of the Post and WWOR-TV (the “October 2006 Order”). The Company has asked the FCC to extend the permanent waiver to WWOR-TV. The temporary waiver remains in effect pursuant to FCC precedent pending FCC action on this request. Parties opposed to the October 2006 Order filed a petition for reconsideration with the FCC, which was denied on May 22, 2009. Other opponents of the October 2006 Order have asked the FCC to reconsider its May 22, 2009 decision and have filed an opposition to the Company’s request for a permanent waiver. It is not possible to predict the timing or outcome of the FCC’s action on this request for reconsideration or its effect on the Company. 
In addition, as a result of these rules, the Company’s future conduct, including the acquisition of any broadcast networks, or stations or any newspapers, in the same local markets in which News Corp owns or operates newspapers or has acquired television stations, may affect News Corp’s ability to own and operate its newspapers or any television stations it acquires or otherwise comply with the rules. Therefore, the Company and News Corp agreed in the Separation and Distribution Agreement that if the Company acquires, after the Separation, newspapers, radio or television broadcast stations or television broadcast networks in the U.S. and such acquisition would impede or be reasonably likely to impede News Corp’s business, then the Company will be required to take certain actions, including divesting assets, in order to permit News Corp to hold its media interests and to comply with such rules. 
Under the Communications Act, no broadcast station licensees may be owned by a corporation if more than 25% of the corporation’s stock is owned or voted by non-U.S. persons, their representatives, or by any other corporation organized under the laws of a foreign country. The Company owns broadcast station licensees in connection with its ownership and operation of U.S. television stations. On April 18, 2012, the Company announced that it had suspended 50% of the voting rights of the Class B Common Stock held by non-U.S. stockholders in order to maintain compliance with U.S. law. As of October 2013, the suspension of voting rights of shares of Class B Common Stock held by non-U.S. stockholders was 35%. This suspension will remain in place for as long as the Company deems it necessary to maintain compliance with the Act. The FCC could review the Company’s compliance with the Act in connection with its consideration of Fox Television Stations’ license renewal applications. 
FCC regulations implementing the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 require each television broadcaster to elect, at three-year intervals, either to (i) require carriage of its signal by cable systems in the station’s market (“must carry”) or (ii) negotiate the terms on which that broadcast station would permit transmission of its signal by the cable systems within its market (“retransmission consent”). Generally, the Company has elected retransmission consent for the stations owned and operated by Fox Television Stations. The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999 requires satellite carriers to carry upon request all television stations located in markets in which the satellite carrier retransmits at least one local station pursuant to the copyright license provided in the statute (“Carry One, Carry All”). FCC regulations implementing this statutory provision require affected stations to elect either mandatory carriage at the same three year intervals applicable to cable “must carry” or negotiate carriage terms with the satellite operators. Several cable and satellite operators filed a petition for rulemaking with the FCC seeking changes in the retransmission consent regulations, including the 
22


 
imposition of mandatory arbitration and required interim carriage in the event the broadcaster and distributor fail to reach a carriage agreement. In March 2011, the FCC responded by initiating a rulemaking to explore changes to its retransmission consent regulations. The FCC tentatively concluded that it does not have the power to order mandatory arbitration or interim carriage and instead sought comment on modifications to its rules affecting retransmission consent negotiations, including providing more guidance under the FCC’s “good faith negotiation” standard, improving notice to consumers in advance of possible disruptions of TV station carriage and eliminating program exclusivity rules that restrict cable and satellite operators’ ability to negotiate for alternative access to network programming. Among other things, the FCC sought comment on whether it should be a per se violation of “good faith negotiation” requirements for a station to agree to give its network the right to approve retransmission consent agreements or to comply with such an approval requirement in the network affiliation agreement. In March 2014, the FCC adopted limited changes to its retransmission consent rules to prohibit a television broadcast station ranked among the top four stations (as measured by audience share) from negotiating retransmission consent jointly with another top four station in the same geographic market if the stations are not commonly owned. The FCC also called for further comment on whether to eliminate the program exclusivity rules. The broadcast industry, including Fox Entertainment Group and Fox Television Stations, has filed comments opposing broader changes to the current retransmission consent regime. It is not possible to predict the timing or outcome of the rulemaking or its effect on the Company. 
Legislation enacted in 1990 limits the amount of commercial matter that may be broadcast during programming designed for children 12 years of age and younger. In addition, under FCC license renewal processing guidelines, television stations are generally required to broadcast a minimum of three hours per week of programming, which, among other requirements, must serve, as a “significant purpose,” the educational and informational needs of children 16 years of age and under. A television station found not to have complied with the programming requirements or commercial limitations could face sanctions, including monetary fines and the possible non-renewal of its license. 
FCC rules prohibit the broadcast by television and radio stations of indecent or profane material between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. Beginning in March 2004, the FCC implemented a new policy regarding this prohibition and generally stepped up its enforcement of indecency violations. Under the new policy, the single use of certain forbidden expletives, or variations of those expletives, were deemed “indecent” and “profane.” The FCC also warned broadcasters that serious multiple violations of the indecency prohibition could lead to license revocation proceedings, and that fines could be imposed for each incident in a single broadcast. Under the new FCC policy, both complaints about indecency and FCC enforcement actions have increased, and several complaints alleging the broadcast of alleged indecent or profane material by Fox Television Stations are pending at the FCC. As of June 2006, the law authorizes the FCC to impose fines of up to $325,000 per incident for violation of the prohibition against indecent and profane broadcasts. 
On March 15, 2006, the FCC determined that the 2002 and 2003 Billboard Music Awards programs, both live broadcasts on FOX, violated the prohibitions against indecent and profane broadcasts because they contained isolated uses of the forbidden expletives. On June 21, 2012, the Supreme Court decided that the FCC failed to give FOX fair notice that the isolated use of expletives could violate the indecency prohibition and therefore the Commission’s standards as applied to the broadcasts in question were unconstitutionally vague. The Court vacated the violations for the Billboard Music Awards broadcasts. On April 1, 2013, the FCC announced it had reduced the backlog of pending indecency complaints and would focus its enforcement on “egregious” cases. The FCC also sought public comment on whether its indecency policies should be altered in light of the Supreme Court’s decision. It is not possible to predict the outcome of the FCC’s inquiry or how it will enforce its indecency rules in the future. 
On February 22, 2008, the FCC issued an order imposing forfeitures of $7,000 each on 13 FOX Affiliates, including five stations owned and operated by the Company, on the grounds that an April 7, 2003 episode of the program Married by America violated the prohibition against indecent broadcasts. On April 4, 2008, the United States commenced an action in federal district court in the District of Columbia against the five Company-owned stations to collect the forfeitures imposed by the FCC. In 2012, the government voluntarily dismissed this collection action. The Company subsequently petitioned the FCC to vacate the forfeitures against the Company and other FOX stations that had been found to have violated the indecency prohibition. The petition remains pending and it is not possible to predict the timing or outcome of FCC action. 
23


 
Modifications to the Company’s programming to reduce the risk of indecency violations could have an adverse effect on the competitive position of Fox Television Stations and FOX. If indecency regulation is extended to cable and satellite programming, and such extension was found to be constitutional, some of the Company’s cable programming services could be subject to additional regulation that might affect subscription and viewership levels. 
The FCC continues to enforce strictly its regulations concerning political advertising, children’s television, environmental concerns, equal employment opportunity, technical operating matters and antenna tower maintenance. FCC rules require the closed captioning of almost all broadcast and cable programming. A federal law enacted in late 2010 requires affiliates of the four largest broadcast networks in the 25 largest markets to carry 50 hours of prime time or children’s programming per calendar quarter with video descriptions, i.e., a verbal description of key visual elements inserted into natural pauses in the audio and broadcast over a separate audio channel. Cable and satellite operators with 50,000 or more subscribers must do the same on each of the top five non-broadcast networks they carry. Compliance has been required since July 1, 2012 and applies to FOX affiliates in the Top 25 markets. Fox News Channel, which is among the top five non-broadcast networks, falls within the statutory exemption for “live or near-live” programming. The same statute requires programming that was captioned on television to retain captions when distributed via Internet Protocol apps or services. Although not required by FCC regulation, the Company has committed to provide program ratings information for its broadcast network programming for use in conjunction with V Chip technology, which blocks the display of television programming based on its rating. The Company has also agreed to make this ratings information available for all full-length entertainment programs that stream on websites the Company controls. FCC regulations governing network affiliation agreements mandate that television broadcast station licensees retain the right to reject or refuse network programming in certain circumstances or to substitute programming that the licensee reasonably believes to be of greater local or national importance. Violation of FCC regulations can result in substantial monetary forfeitures, periodic reporting conditions, short-term license renewals and, in egregious cases, denial of license renewal or revocation of license. 
Filmed Entertainment 
United States. TCFF is subject to the provisions of so-called “trade practice laws” in effect in 25 states relating to theatrical distribution of motion pictures. These laws substantially restrict the licensing of motion pictures unless theater owners are first invited to attend a screening of the motion pictures and, in certain instances, also prohibit payment of advances and guarantees to motion picture distributors by exhibitors. Further, pursuant to various consent judgments, TCFF and certain other motion picture companies are subject to certain restrictions on their trade practices in the United States, including a requirement to offer motion pictures for exhibition to theaters on a theater-by-theater basis and, in some cases, a prohibition against the ownership of theaters. 
Other International Regulation. In countries outside of the United States, there are a variety of existing or contemplated governmental laws and regulations that may affect the ability of TCFF to distribute and/or license its motion picture and television products to cinema, television or in-home media, including copyright laws and regulations that may or may not be adequate to protect its interests, cinema screen quotas, television quotas, contract term limitations, discriminatory taxes and other discriminatory treatment of U.S. products. The ability of countries to deny market access or refuse national treatment to products originating outside their territories is regulated under various international agreements, including the World Trade Organization’s General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and General Agreement on Trade and Services; however, these agreements have limited application with respect to preventing the denial of market access to audio-visual products originating outside the European Union. 
Internet 
The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”) prohibits websites from collecting personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without prior parental consent. The Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (“CAN-SPAM”) regulates the distribution of unsolicited commercial emails, or “spam.” The Video Privacy Protection Act (“VPPA”) prohibits the knowing disclosure of information that identifies a person as having requested or obtained specific video materials from a “video tape service provider.” Online services provided by the Company may be subject to COPPA, CAN-SPAM and VPPA requirements. 
24


 
Federal regulators’ interest in issues of privacy, cybersecurity and data security has been steadily increasing. On February 23, 2012, the Administration issued a white paper on consumer data privacy that includes a Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights. The Administration convened multi-stakeholder processes to implement the Bill of Rights through industry codes of conduct that would be enforceable by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and State Attorneys General. The Administration also announced it would work with Congress to implement these rights through legislation. The first multi-stakeholder group focused on creation of a Do-Not-Track standard but no agreement was reached by the participants. On March 26, 2012, the FTC released a report on consumer privacy, which sets forth a detailed privacy framework and urges industry to accelerate the pace of adoption of self-regulatory measures, including more widespread adoption of a Do-Not-Track browser mechanism. The report also recommends that Congress consider baseline privacy legislation incorporating the principles articulated in the framework. In May 2014 additional reports were issued by the Administration and the FTC on Big Data and data brokers, and the Administration called for public comments on how developments related to “big data” impact the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights.
A number of privacy and data security bills have been introduced in both Houses of Congress that address the collection, maintenance and use of personal information, web browsing and geolocation data, data security and breach notification requirements, and cybersecurity. Some state legislatures have already adopted legislation that regulates how businesses operate on the Internet, including measures relating to privacy, data security and data breaches. The industry released a set of self-regulatory online behavioral advertising principles in 2009, which have been implemented by web publishers, online advertisers and online advertising networks. In November 2011, these principles were extended to the use of online consumer data for purposes other than advertising and in July 2013 to the mobile environment. The industry is also working on principles that would establish a self-regulatory browser-based Do-Not-Track regime. It is unclear whether these and other industry self-regulatory efforts alone will address the concerns expressed by some federal and state officials about the collection of anonymous data online or via mobile applications to serve targeted content and advertising. It is not possible to predict whether proposed privacy and data security legislation will be enacted or to determine what effect such legislation might have on the Company’s business. 
Foreign governments are raising similar privacy and data security concerns. In particular, the EU has proposed a new privacy regulation (the “EU Regulation”) that would replace the current Data Protection Directive, would tighten regulation of the collection, use and security of online data and would continue to restrict the trans-border flow of data. Several European countries have issued new guidelines under the EU Cookie Directive that require robust disclosures and consumer choice before a user can be tracked online. European industry has implemented a self-regulatory regime for online behavioral advertising that is largely consistent with the U.S. self-regulatory framework. The proposed EU Regulation will not be effective for at least a year and may undergo many changes before it is adopted. It is unclear how the final EU Regulation would affect the Company’s business. Canada, Australia and countries in South/Latin America and Asia are also strengthening their privacy laws and the enforcement of privacy and data security requirements. 
The Company monitors pending legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain relevance, analyze impact and develop strategic direction surrounding regulatory trends and developments. 
Intellectual Property 
The Company’s intellectual property assets include: copyrights in motion pictures, television programming, books, publications, websites and technologies; trademarks in names, logos and characters; domain names; patents or patent applications for inventions related to its products, business methods and/or services; and licenses of intellectual property rights of various kinds. The Company derives value from these assets through the theatrical release of films and the production, distribution and/or licensing of its films and television programming to domestic and international television and cable networks, pay television services, pay-per-view, video-on-demand services and DTH satellite services, operation of websites, and through the sale of products, such as DVDs, Blu-rays, books and publications, among others. 
The Company devotes significant resources to protecting its intellectual property in the United States and other key foreign territories. To protect these assets, the Company relies upon a combination of copyright, trademark, unfair competition, patent, trade secret and other laws and contract provisions. However, there can be no 
25


 
assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case. Policing unauthorized use of the Company’s products and services and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken may not in every case prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties of the Company’s intellectual property. The Company seeks to limit that threat through a combination of approaches, including offering legitimate market alternatives, deploying digital rights management technologies, pursuing legal sanctions for infringement, promoting appropriate legislative initiatives and international treaties and enhancing public awareness of the meaning and value of intellectual property and intellectual property laws. Piracy, including in the digital environment, continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property. 
Third parties may challenge the validity or scope of the Company’s intellectual property from time to time, and such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights. Irrespective of their validity, such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations. Moreover, effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories. Therefore, the Company engages in efforts to strengthen and update intellectual property protection around the world, including efforts to ensure the effective enforcement of intellectual property laws and remedies for infringement.
 




ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS 
Prospective investors should consider carefully the risk factors set forth below before making an investment in the Company’s securities. 
A Decline in Advertising Expenditures Could Cause the Company’s Revenues and Operating Results to Decline Significantly in any Given Period or in Specific Markets. 
The Company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising on or in its television stations, broadcast and cable networks and direct broadcast satellite services. Expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions, as well as budgeting and buying patterns. A decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers’ spending priorities. Demand for the Company’s products is also a factor in determining advertising rates. For example, ratings points for the Company’s television stations and broadcast and cable networks are factors that are weighed when determining advertising rates, and with respect to the Company’s television stations and broadcast and television networks, when determining the affiliate rates received by the Company. In addition, newer technologies, including new video formats, streaming and downloading capabilities via the Internet, video-on-demand, personal video recorders and other devices and technologies are increasing the number of media and entertainment choices available to audiences. Some of these devices and technologies allow users to view television or motion pictures from a remote location or on a time-delayed basis and provide users the ability to fast-forward, rewind, pause and skip programming and advertisements. These technological developments which are increasing the number of media and entertainment choices available to audiences could negatively impact not only consumer demand for our content and services but also could affect the attractiveness of the Company’s offerings to viewers, advertisers and/or distributors. Failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging technologies or changes in consumer behavior could have an adverse effect on our business. Further, a decrease in advertising expenditures, reduced demand for the Company’s offerings or the inability to obtain market ratings that adequately measure demand for the Company’s content on personal video recorders and mobile devices could lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising spending, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s businesses and assets. 
The Company is exposed to risks associated with weak domestic and global economic conditions and increased volatility and disruption in the financial markets.
The Company’s businesses, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by weak domestic and global economic conditions. Factors that affect economic conditions include the rate of unemployment, the level of consumer confidence and changes in consumer spending habits. The Company also faces risks, including currency volatility and the stability of global local economies, associated with the impact of weak domestic and global economic conditions on advertisers, affiliates, suppliers, wholesale distributors, retailers, insurers, theater operators and others with which it does business. 
26


 
Increased volatility and disruptions in the financial markets could make it more difficult and more expensive for the Company to refinance outstanding indebtedness and obtain new financing. Disruptions in the financial markets can also adversely affect the Company’s lenders, insurers, customers and counterparties, including vendors, retailers and film co-financing partners. For instance, the inability of the Company’s counterparties to obtain capital on acceptable terms could impair their ability to perform under their agreements with the Company and lead to negative effects on the Company, including business disruptions, decreased revenues and increases in bad debt expenses. 
Acceptance of the Company’s Films and Television Programming by the Public is Difficult to Predict, Which Could Lead to Fluctuations in Revenues. 
Feature film and television production and distribution are speculative businesses since the revenues derived from the production and distribution of a feature film or television series depend primarily upon its acceptance by the public, which is difficult to predict. The commercial success of a feature film or television series also depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing films and television series released into the marketplace at or near the same time, the availability of a growing number of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, general economic conditions and their effects on consumer spending and other tangible and intangible factors, all of which can change and cannot be predicted with certainty. Further, the theatrical success of a feature film and the audience ratings for a television series are generally key factors in generating revenues from other distribution channels, such as home entertainment and premium pay television, with respect to feature films, and syndication, with respect to television series. 
The Company Could Suffer Losses Due to Asset Impairment Charges for Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Programming. 
In accordance with applicable generally accepted accounting principles, the Company performs an annual impairment assessment of its recorded goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including FCC licenses, during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. The Company also continually evaluates whether current factors or indicators, such as the prevailing conditions in the capital markets, require the performance of an interim impairment assessment of those assets, as well as other investments and other long-lived assets. Any significant shortfall, now or in the future, in advertising revenue and/or the expected popularity of the programming for which the Company has acquired rights could lead to a downward revision in the fair value of certain reporting units. A downward revision in the fair value of a reporting unit, indefinite-lived intangible assets, investments or long-lived assets could result in an impairment and a non-cash charge would be required. Any such charge could be material to the Company’s reported net earnings. 
Fluctuations in Foreign Exchange Rates Could Have an Adverse Effect on the Company’s Results of Operations. 
The Company has significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of the Company operations are conducted in foreign currencies. The value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the U.S. dollar. As a result, the Company is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations, which could have an adverse effect on its results of operations in a given period or in specific markets. 
For example, our business activities in Venezuela operate in a highly inflationary economy. Recently, there have been significant changes to the foreign currency exchange rate environment in Venezuela governing the conversion of Venezuelan Bolivars (“Bolivars”) to U.S. Dollars. Companies generally have used the official exchange rate controlled by Venezuela’s Commission for the Administration of Foreign Exchange (“CADIVI”), which is 6.3 Bolivars per U.S. Dollar unless they had transactions or were among the entities the Venezuelan government had specifically authorized to use the Supplementary Foreign Currency Administration System (“SICAD”) auction rate. In January 2014, the Venezuelan government significantly expanded the use of the SICAD rate and, more recently, in March 2014, the Venezuelan government created a third currency exchange mechanism called SICAD 2 and said it may be used by all entities for all transactions. Until March 31, 2014, our Bolivar denominated net monetary assets were translated at the official exchange rate of 6.3 Bolivars per U.S. Dollar. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we were able to use the SICAD 2 mechanism to convert a portion of our Bolivar denominated cash to U.S. Dollars. Accordingly, we remeasured all our Bolivar denominated net monetary assets at the SICAD 2 exchange rate resulting in a devaluation loss of approximately $100 million for fiscal 2014. The Venezuelan government may issue more regulations or take other steps that might introduce significant 
27


 
uncertainty regarding the exchange rate that we can access to convert our Venezuelan Bolivar denominated monetary assets to U.S. Dollars. Such measures can also affect our decision on which exchange rate(s) to use for financial reporting purposes.
The Loss of Carriage Agreements Could Cause the Company’s Revenue and Operating Results to Decline Significantly in any Given Period or in Specific Markets. 
The Company’s broadcast stations and cable networks maintain affiliation and carriage arrangements that enable them to reach a large percentage of cable and direct broadcast satellite households across the United States. The loss of a significant number of these arrangements or the loss of carriage on basic programming tiers could reduce the distribution of the Company’s broadcast stations and cable networks, which may adversely affect those networks’ revenues from subscriber fees and their ability to sell national and local advertising time. The Company is dependent upon the maintenance of affiliation agreements with third party owned television stations and there can be no assurance that these affiliation agreements will be renewed in the future on terms acceptable to the Company. The loss of a significant number of these affiliation arrangements could reduce the distribution of FOX and MyNetworkTV and adversely affect the Company’s ability to sell national advertising time. 
The Inability to Renew Sports Programming Rights Could Cause the Company’s Affiliate and Advertising Revenue to Decline Significantly in any Given Period or in Specific Markets. 
The sports rights contracts between the Company, on the one hand, and various professional sports leagues and teams, on the other, have varying duration and renewal terms. As these contracts expire, renewals on favorable terms may be sought; however, third parties may outbid the current rights holders for the rights contracts. In addition, professional sports leagues or teams may create their own networks or the renewal costs could substantially exceed the original contract cost. The loss of rights could impact the extent of the sports coverage offered by the Company and its affiliates, as it relates to FOX, and could adversely affect the Company’s advertising and affiliate revenues. Upon renewal, the Company’s results could be adversely affected if escalations in sports programming rights costs are unmatched by increases in advertising rates and, in the case of cable networks, subscriber fees. 
The Company Relies on Network and Information Systems and Other Technology Whose Failure or Misuse, Could Cause a Disruption of Services or Improper Disclosure of Personal Data or Confidential Information, Resulting in Increased Costs or Loss of Revenue. 
Network and information systems and other technologies, including those related to the Company’s network management, are important to its business activities. Network and information systems-related events, such as computer hackings, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing, as well as power outages, natural disasters (including extreme weather), terrorist activities or human error that may affect such systems, could result in disruption of our services or improper disclosure of personal data or confidential information. In recent years, there has been a rise in the number of cyber attacks on companies’ network and information systems by both state-sponsored and criminal organizations, and as a result, the risks associated with such an event continue to increase. A significant failure, compromise, breach or interruption of the Company’s systems could result in a disruption of its operations, customer or advertiser dissatisfaction, damage to its reputation or brands and a loss of customers or revenues. If any such failure, interruption or similar event results in the improper disclosure of information maintained in the Company’s information systems and networks or those of its vendors, including personnel, customer and vendor information, the Company could also be subject to liability under relevant contractual obligations and laws and regulations protecting personal data and privacy. Efforts by the Company and its vendors to develop, implement and maintain security measures may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring, and any network and information systems-related events could require the Company to expend significant resources to remedy such event. Moreover, the development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated.
Technological Developments May Increase the Threat of Content Piracy and Signal Theft and Limit the Company’s Ability to Protect Its Intellectual Property Rights. 
Content piracy and signal theft present a threat to the Company’s revenues from products and services, including, but not limited to, films, television shows, cable and other programming. The Company seeks to limit the 
28


 
threat of content piracy and direct broadcast satellite programming signal theft; however, policing unauthorized use of the Company’s products and services and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken by the Company may not in every case prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties. Developments in technology, including digital copying, file compressing and the growing penetration of high-bandwidth Internet connections, increase the threat of content piracy by making it easier to duplicate and widely distribute high-quality pirated material. In addition, developments in software or devices that circumvent encryption technology and the falling prices of devices incorporating such technologies increase the threat of unauthorized use and distribution of direct broadcast satellite programming signals and the proliferation of user-generated content sites and live and stored video streaming sites, which deliver unauthorized copies of copyrighted content, including those emanating from other countries in various languages, may adversely impact the Company’s businesses. The proliferation of unauthorized distribution and use of the Company’s content could have an adverse effect on the Company’s businesses and profitability because it reduces the revenue that the Company could potentially receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of its products and services. 
The Company has taken, and will continue to take, a variety of actions to combat piracy and signal theft, both individually and, in some instances, together with industry associations. However, protection of the Company’s intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of the Company’s rights as defined by applicable laws in the United States and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed. If those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of the Company’s rights, or if existing laws are changed, the Company’s ability to generate revenue from intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and enforcing our rights may increase. There can be no assurance that the Company’s efforts to enforce its rights and protect its products, services and intellectual property will be successful in preventing content piracy or signal theft. Further, while piracy and technology tools continue to escalate, if any U.S. or international laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property are repealed or weakened or not adequately enforced, or if the legal system fails to evolve and adapt to new technologies that facilitate piracy, we may be unable to effectively protect our rights and the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our costs of enforcing our rights could increase. 
The Company Must Respond to Changes in Consumer Behavior as a Result of New Technologies in Order to Remain Competitive. 
Technology, particularly digital technology used in the entertainment industry, continues to evolve rapidly, leading to alternative methods for the delivery and storage of digital content. These technological advancements have driven changes in consumer behavior and have empowered consumers to seek more control over when, where and how they consume digital content. Content owners are increasingly delivering their content directly to consumers over the Internet, often without charge, and innovations in distribution platforms have enabled consumers to view such Internet-delivered content on televisions and portable devices. There is a risk that the Company’s responses to these changes and strategies to remain competitive, including distribution of its content on a “pay” basis, may not be adopted by consumers. In addition, enhanced Internet capabilities and other new media may reduce television viewership, the demand for DVDs and Blu-rays and the desire to see motion pictures in theaters, which could negatively affect the Company’s revenues. The Company’s failure to protect and exploit the value of its content, while responding to and developing new technology and business models to take advantage of advancements in technology and the latest consumer preferences, could have a significant adverse effect on the Company’s businesses, asset values and results of operations. 
Labor Disputes May Have an Adverse Effect on the Company’s Business. 
In a variety of the Company’s businesses, the Company and its partners engage the services of writers, directors, actors and other talent, trade employees and others who are subject to collective bargaining agreements, including employees of the Company’s film and television studio operations. If the Company or its partners are unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements, it is possible that the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. Such actions, as well as higher costs in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business by causing delays in production or by reducing profit margins. 
29


 
Changes in U.S. or Foreign Regulations May Have an Adverse Effect on the Company’s Business. 
The Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign regulations in the jurisdictions in which its businesses operate. In general, the television broadcasting and multichannel video programming and distribution industries in the United States are highly regulated by federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies, including the FCC. The FCC generally regulates, among other things, the ownership of media, broadcast and multichannel video programming and technical operations of broadcast licensees. Our program services and online properties are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including those relating to issues such as content regulation, user privacy and data protection, and consumer protection, among others. Further, the United States Congress, the FCC and state legislatures currently have under consideration, and may in the future adopt, new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters, including technological changes and measures relating to privacy and data security, which could, directly or indirectly, affect the operations and ownership of the Company’s U.S. media properties. Similarly, new laws or regulations or changes in interpretations of law or in regulations imposed by governments in other jurisdictions in which the Company, or entities in which the Company has an interest, operate could require changes in the operations or ownership of these international media properties. In addition, laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions which regulate, among other things, licensing arrangements, local content requirements, carriage requirements regarding pricing and distribution, and limitations on advertising time, may impact the operations and results of our international businesses.
In addition, changes in tax laws, regulations or the interpretations thereof in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which the Company has operations could affect the Company’s results of operations. 
U.S. Citizenship Requirements May Limit Common Stock Ownership and Voting Rights. 
The Company owns broadcast station licensees in connection with its ownership and operation of U.S. television stations. Under U.S. law, no broadcast station licensee may be owned by a corporation if more than 25% of its stock is owned or voted by non-U.S. persons, their representatives, or by any other corporation organized under the laws of a foreign country. The Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the Board of Directors to prevent, cure or mitigate the effect of stock ownership above the applicable foreign ownership threshold by taking any action including: refusing to permit any transfer of common stock to or ownership of common stock by a non-U.S. stockholder; voiding a transfer of common stock to a non-U.S. stockholder; suspending rights of stock ownership if held by a non-U.S. stockholder; or redeeming common stock held by a non-U.S. stockholder. In order to maintain compliance with U.S. law, as of October 2013, the suspension of voting rights of the Class B Common Stock held by non-U.S. stockholders was 35%. This suspension will remain in place for as long as the Company deems it necessary to maintain compliance with applicable U.S. law, and may be adjusted by the Audit Committee as it deems appropriate. The Company is not able to predict whether it will need to adjust the suspension or whether additional action pursuant to its Restated Certificate of Incorporation may be necessary. The FCC could review the Company’s compliance with applicable U.S. law in connection with its consideration of the Company’s renewal applications for licenses to operate the broadcast stations the Company owns. 
The Company and News Corp Face Investigations Regarding Allegations of Phone Hacking, Illegal Data Access, Inappropriate Payments to Public Officials and Other Related Matters and Related Civil Lawsuits. 
U.S. regulators and governmental authorities are conducting investigations relating to the U.K. Newspaper Matters. The Company is cooperating with these investigations. It is not possible at this time to estimate the liability, if any, of the Company relating to these investigations. 
In connection with the Separation, the Company and News Corp agreed in the Separation and Distribution Agreement that the Company will indemnify News Corp, on an after-tax basis, for payments made after the Separation arising out of civil claims and investigations relating to the U.K. Newspaper Matters, as well as legal and professional fees and expenses paid in connection with the related criminal matters, other than fees, expenses and costs relating to employees who are not (i) directors, officers or certain designated employees or (ii) with respect to civil matters, co-defendants with News Corp. 
It is possible that these proceedings and any adverse resolution thereof, including any fines or other penalties associated with any plea, judgment or similar result could damage the Company’s reputation, impair its ability to conduct its business and adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.

Risks Related to the Separation 
If the Separation, Together with Certain Related Transactions, Were Ultimately Determined to be Taxable Transactions for U.S. Federal Income Tax Purposes, then We Could Be Subject to Significant Tax Liability. 
The Company received (i) a private letter ruling from the IRS substantially to the effect that, among other things, the distribution of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock of News Corp qualifies as tax-free under Sections 368 and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares of News Corp stock and (ii) an opinion from the law firm of Hogan Lovells US LLP confirming the tax-free status of the distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes, including confirming the satisfaction of the requirements under Section 368 and 355 of the Code not specifically addressed in the IRS private letter ruling. The opinion of Hogan Lovells US LLP will not be binding on the IRS or the courts, and there is no assurance that the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position. 
The private letter ruling and the opinion rely on certain facts and assumptions, and certain representations from the Company and News Corp regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters. Notwithstanding the receipt of the private letter ruling and the opinion, the IRS could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated, or that the distribution or the internal transactions should be taxable for other reasons, including as a result of a significant change in stock or asset ownership after the distribution. If the distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable, the distribution could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and U.S. stockholders and certain non-U.S. stockholders could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. In addition, if the internal reorganization and/or the distribution is ultimately determined to be taxable, the Company would recognize gains on the internal reorganization and/or recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of shares of the News Corp common stock distributed to our stockholders on the distribution date over our tax basis in such shares of our common stock. 
We Could Be Liable for Income Taxes Owed by News Corp. 
Each member of our consolidated group, which until June 28, 2013 included News Corp and each of our other subsidiaries, is jointly and severally liable for the U.S. federal income tax liability of each other member of the consolidated group. Consequently, we could be liable in the event any such liability is incurred, and not discharged, by any other member of our consolidated group. Under the terms of the tax sharing and indemnification agreement that we entered into in connection with the Separation, we will be required to indemnify News Corp for any such liability. Disputes or assessments could arise during future audits by the IRS in amounts that we cannot quantify. 
We Might Not Be Able to Engage in Desirable Strategic Transactions and Equity Issuances Because of Certain Restrictions Relating to Requirements for Tax-Free Distributions for U.S. Federal Income Tax Purposes. 
Our ability to engage in significant strategic transactions and equity issuances may be limited or restricted in order to preserve, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the tax-free nature of the distribution. Even if the distribution otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code, it may result in corporate level taxable gain to us under Section 355(e) of the Code if 50% or more, by vote or value, of shares of our stock or News Corp’s stock are acquired or issued as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the distribution. 
To preserve the tax-free treatment of the distribution and the internal transactions in connection with the distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes, under the tax sharing and indemnification agreement that we entered into with News Corp, we will be prohibited from taking or failing to take certain actions that may prevent the distribution and related transactions from being tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Further, for the two-year period following the distribution, we may be prohibited from: 




·

approving or allowing any transaction that results in a change in ownership of more than a specified percentage of our common stock, 




·

a merger, 




·

a redemption of equity securities exceeding 20% of its outstanding capital stock, 




·

a sale or other disposition of certain businesses or a specified percentage of our assets, or 
31


 




·

an acquisition of a business or assets with equity securities to the extent one or more persons would acquire in excess of a specified percentage of our common stock 
These restrictions may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new business or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business. 
The Separation and Distribution Agreement May Restrict Us From Acquiring or Owning Certain Types of Assets in the U.S. 
The FCC has promulgated certain rules and regulations that limit the ownership of radio and television broadcast stations, television broadcast networks and newspapers (the “Broadcast Ownership Rules”). Under the FCC’s rules for determining ownership of the media assets described above, the Murdoch Family Trust’s ownership interest in both News Corp and the Company following the Separation would generally result in each company’s businesses and assets being attributable to the Murdoch Family Trust for purposes of determining compliance with the Broadcast Ownership Rules. Consequently, our future conduct, including the acquisition of any broadcast networks, or stations or any newspapers, in the same local markets in which News Corp owns or operates newspapers or has acquired television stations, may affect News Corp’s ability to own and operate its newspapers or any television stations it acquires or otherwise comply with the Broadcast Ownership Rules. Therefore, we and News Corp agreed in the Separation and Distribution Agreement that if the Company acquires, after the Separation, newspapers, radio or television broadcast stations or television broadcast networks in the U.S. and such acquisition would impede or be reasonably likely to impede News Corp’s business, then the Company will be required to take certain actions, including divesting assets, in order to permit News Corp to hold its media interests and to comply with such rules. This agreement will effectively limit the activities or strategic business alternatives available to us if such activities or strategic business alternatives implicate the Broadcast Ownership Rules and would impede or be reasonably likely to impede News Corp’s business. 
The Indemnification Arrangements We Entered Into With News Corp in Connection With the Separation May Require Us to Divert Cash to Satisfy Indemnification Obligations to News Corp. 
Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and certain other related agreements, the Company agreed to indemnify News Corp for certain liabilities and News Corp agreed to indemnify the Company for certain liabilities. As a result, we could be required, under certain circumstances, to indemnify News Corp against certain liabilities to the extent such liabilities result from an action we or our affiliates take or from any breach of our or our affiliates’ representations, covenants or obligations under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, tax sharing and indemnification agreement or any other agreement entered into in connection with the Separation. 
Certain of Our Directors and Officers May Have Actual or Potential Conflicts of Interest Because of Their Equity Ownership in News Corp, and Certain of Our Officers and Directors May Have Actual or Potential Conflicts of Interest Because They Also Serve as Officers and/or on the Board of Directors of News Corp. 
Certain of our directors and executive officers own shares of News Corp’s common stock, and the individual holdings may be significant for some of these individuals compared to their total assets. In addition, certain of our officers and directors also serve as officers and/or as directors of News Corp, including our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer K. Rupert Murdoch, who serves as News Corp’s Executive Chairman, our Non-Executive Co-Chairman Lachlan K. Murdoch, who serves as News Corp’s Non-Executive Co-Chairman and our Group General Counsel Gerson Zweifach, who serves as News Corp’s General Counsel. This ownership or service to both companies may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for News Corp and us. 
For example, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute that may arise between News Corp and us regarding the terms of the agreements governing the internal reorganization, the distribution and the relationship thereafter between the companies, including with respect to the indemnification of certain matters. In addition to any other arrangements that the Company and News Corp may agree to implement, the Company and News Corp agreed that officers and directors who serve at both companies will recuse themselves from decisions where conflicts arise due to their positions at both companies.
