Item 1A.  Risk Factors. 
The following discussion of risk factors known to us contains important information for the understanding of our “forward-looking statements,” which are discussed immediately following Item 7A. of this Form 10-K and elsewhere. These risk factors should also be read in conjunction with Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in this Form 10-K. 
We urge you to consider carefully the risks described below, as well as in other reports and materials that we file with the SEC and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. If any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this Form 10-K were to materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
Demand for the majority of our services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by the oil and gas industry.  The current significant oil and gas industry downturn has resulted in reduced demand for oilfield services, which has had, and may continue to have, a significant adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If these conditions worsen or oil and gas prices do not improve, further reductions in spending by the oil and gas industry could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Demand for the majority of our services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves. These expenditures are generally dependent on the industry’s view of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to the industry’s view of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas.  Since 2014, oil and gas prices have declined significantly, resulting in lower expenditures by the oil and gas industry.  As a result, many of our customers have reduced or delayed their oil and gas exploration and production spending, reducing the demand for our services and exerting downward pressure on the prices that we charge.  These conditions have had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our financial condition.  
Continued low oil and gas prices or a further decline in oil and gas prices could cause a reduction in cash flows for our customers, which could have significant adverse effects on the financial condition of some of our customers. This could result in project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in payment of, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us. These effects could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
The prices for oil and natural gas have historically been volatile and can be affected by a variety of factors, including: 




 

●

demand for hydrocarbons, which is affected by general economic and business conditions; 




 

●

the ability or willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) to set and maintain production levels for oil; 




 

●

oil and gas production levels by non-OPEC countries; 




 

●

the level of excess production capacity; 




 

●

political and economic uncertainty and geopolitical unrest; 




 

●

the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration and production activity; 




 

●

access to potential resources; 




 

●

governmental policies and subsidies; 




 

●

the costs of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas; 




 

●

technological advances affecting energy consumption; and 




 

●

weather conditions. 
There can be no assurance that the demand or pricing for oil and natural gas will follow historic patterns or recover in the near term.  Continued or worsening conditions in the oil and gas industry could further adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

A significant portion of our revenue is derived from our non-United States operations, which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the approximately 85 countries in which we operate. 
Our non-United States operations accounted for approximately 76% of our consolidated revenue in 2015, 71% in 2014 and 73% in 2013. Operations in countries other than the United States are subject to various risks, including: 




 

●

volatility in political, social and economic conditions in certain areas; 




 

●

exposure to possible expropriation of our assets or other governmental actions; 




 

●

social unrest, acts of terrorism, war or other armed conflict; 




 

●

confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies; 




 

●

deprivation of contract rights; 




 

●

trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the European Union, the United States or other countries; 




 

●

restrictions under the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar legislation in other countries; 




 

●

restrictions on the repatriation of income or capital; 




 

●

currency exchange controls; 




 

●

inflation; and 




 

●

currency exchange rate fluctuations and devaluations. 
We completed the wind down of our service operations in Iran during the second quarter of 2013. Prior to this, certain of our non-US subsidiaries provided oilfield services to the National Iranian Oil Company and certain of its affiliates (“NIOC”). We have reclassified the results of this business as a discontinued operation. All prior periods have been restated accordingly. 
Our residual transactions or dealings with the government of Iran during 2015 consisted of payments of taxes and other typical governmental charges. Certain of our non-US subsidiaries maintained depository accounts at the Dubai branch of Bank Saderat Iran (“Saderat”), and at Bank Tejarat (“Tejarat”) in Tehran and in Kish for the deposit by NIOC of amounts owed to non-US subsidiaries of Schlumberger for prior services rendered in Iran and for the maintenance of such amounts previously received. One non-US subsidiary also maintains an account at Tejarat for payment of local expenses such as taxes and utilities. We anticipate that we will discontinue our dealings with Saderat and Tejarat following the receipt of all amounts owed to us for prior services rendered in Iran. 
Our failure to comply with Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other laws could have a negative impact on our ongoing operations.
We are subject to complex US and foreign laws and regulations, such as the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and various other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws.  We are also subject to trade sanction laws that restrict certain operations in various countries or with certain persons.  The internal controls, policies and procedures, and employee training and compliance programs we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies and violating applicable laws and regulations.  Any determination that we have violated or are responsible for violations of anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.  Violations of international and US laws and regulations may result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies, restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business, operating results and financial condition.
Environmental compliance costs and liabilities could reduce our earnings and cash available for operations. 
We are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to importation and use of hazardous materials, radioactive materials, chemicals and explosives and to environmental protection, including laws and regulations governing air emissions, hydraulic fracturing, water discharges and waste management. We incur, and expect to continue to incur, capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations. The technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex, stringent and expensive to implement. These laws may provide for “strict liability” for remediation costs, damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety. Strict liability can render a party liable for damages without regard to negligence or fault on the part of the party. Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances. 
We use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations. In addition, many of our current and former properties are, or have been, used for industrial purposes. Accordingly, we could become subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of potentially contaminated properties, and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to, or releases of, hazardous substances. In addition, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, new laws and regulations, the 
8
 

discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis of new or increased liabilities that could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations. 
We could be subject to substantial liability claims, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
The technical complexities of our operations expose us to a wide range of significant health, safety and environmental risks. Our offerings involve production-related activities, radioactive materials, chemicals, explosives and other equipment and services that are deployed in challenging exploration, development and production environments. An accident involving these services or equipment, or a failure of a product, could cause personal injury, loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, equipment or the environment, or suspension of operations. Our insurance may not protect us against liability for some kinds of events, including events involving pollution, or against losses resulting from business interruption. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate. Any damages caused by our services or products that are not covered by insurance, or are in excess of policy limits or are subject to substantial deductibles, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
Demand for our products and services could be reduced by existing and future legislation or regulations. 
Environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the United States and other countries have been focusing considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gasses and their potential role in climate change.  Existing or future legislation and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, as well as government initiatives to conserve energy or promote the use of alternative energy sources, may significantly curtail demand for and production of fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for our services. This may, in turn, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
Some international, national, state and local governments and agencies have also adopted laws and regulations or are evaluating proposed legislation and regulations that are focused on the extraction of shale gas or oil using hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is a stimulation treatment routinely performed on oil and gas wells in low-permeability reservoirs. Specially engineered fluids are pumped at high pressure and rate into the reservoir interval to be treated, causing cracks in the target formation. Proppant, such as sand of a particular size, is mixed with the treatment fluid to keep the cracks open when the treatment is complete. Future hydraulic fracturing-related legislation or regulations could limit or ban hydraulic fracturing, or lead to operational delays and increased costs, and therefore reduce demand for our pressure pumping services. If such additional international, national, state or local legislation or regulations are enacted, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
If we are unable to maintain technology leadership, this could adversely affect any competitive advantage we hold. 
The oilfield service industry is highly competitive.  Our ability to continually provide competitive technology and services can impact our ability to defend, maintain or increase prices for our services, maintain market share, and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers.  If we are unable to continue to develop and produce competitive technology or deliver it to our clients in a timely and cost-competitive manner in the various markets we serve, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
Limitations on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, including our trade secrets, could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold. 
Some of our products or services, and the processes we use to produce or provide them, have been granted patent protection, have patent applications pending or are trade secrets. Our business may be adversely affected if our patents are unenforceable, the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology, our patent applications are denied, or our trade secrets are not adequately protected. Our competitors may be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
We may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights. 
The tools, techniques, methodologies, programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. Infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business. Royalty payments under licenses from third parties, if available, would increase our costs. Additionally, developing non-infringing technologies would increase our costs. If a license were not available, we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Failure to obtain and retain skilled technical personnel could impede our operations. 
We require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our business. Competition for the personnel required for our businesses intensifies as activity increases. In periods of high utilization it may become more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals. This could increase our costs or have other adverse effects on our operations. 
Severe weather conditions may affect our operations. 
Our business may be materially affected by severe weather conditions in areas where we operate. This may entail the evacuation of personnel and stoppage of services. In addition, if particularly severe weather affects platforms or structures, this may result in a suspension of activities. Any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
Cybersecurity risks and threats could affect our business.
We rely heavily on information systems to conduct our business.  There can be no assurance that the systems we have designed to prevent or limit the effects of cyber incidents or attacks will be sufficient to prevent or detect such incidents or attacks, or to avoid a material impact on our systems when such incidents or attacks do occur.  If our systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks are circumvented or breached, this could result in the loss of our intellectual property or other proprietary information, including customer data, and disruption of our business operations.
Our ability to complete the proposed merger with Cameron is subject to various closing conditions and the receipt of consents and approvals from government entities which may impose conditions that could materially adversely affect Cameron or Schlumberger or cause the merger to be abandoned.
The merger agreement contains certain closing conditions, including approval of the proposed merger by Cameron stockholders, the absence of injunctions or other legal restrictions and that no material adverse effect shall have occurred with respect to either company. On December 17, 2015, Cameron stockholders voted to adopt our proposed merger.  Also, in November 2015 the U.S. Department of Justice cleared our proposed merger without any conditions.  However, we will be unable to complete the merger until consents and approvals are received from the European Commission and various other governmental entities.  Regulatory entities have broad discretion in administering the governing regulations and may impose certain requirements or obligations as conditions for their approval. The merger agreement may require us to accept conditions from these regulators that could adversely affect the combined company. If the regulatory clearances are not received, or they are not received on terms that satisfy the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, then we will not be obligated to complete the merger. We can provide no assurance that the various closing conditions will be satisfied and that the necessary approvals will be obtained, or that any required conditions will not materially adversely affect the combined company following the merger. In addition, we can provide no assurance that these conditions will not result in the abandonment or delay of the merger.
Failure to complete the proposed merger with Cameron could negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial results.
If the proposed merger is not completed, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and we would be subject to several risks, including a decline in the market price of our common stock, negative customer perception and diversion of management’s focus on pursuing other opportunities that could be beneficial to us, in each case, without realizing any of the benefits that might have resulted had the merger been completed.
Multiple lawsuits have been filed against us and Cameron challenging the proposed merger, and an adverse ruling in any such lawsuit may prevent the merger from being completed.
After the announcement of the proposed merger, four putative class action lawsuits were commenced on behalf of stockholders of Cameron against Cameron and its directors, as well as against us and Schlumberger Holding Corporation and Rain Merger Sub (both of which are indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries).   These lawsuits were consolidated for all purposes and a consolidated amended class action complaint (the “Consolidated Complaint”) was filed. The Consolidated Complaint seeks various remedies, including enjoining the merger from being consummated, rescission of the merger to the extent already implemented and the plaintiffs’ costs and fees.  Additional lawsuits with similar allegations may be filed. While we believe these lawsuits are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend against such claims, the outcome of any such litigation is inherently uncertain.  One of the conditions to the closing of the merger is that no law, order, injunction, judgment, decree, ruling or other similar requirement shall be in effect that prohibits the completion of the merger. Accordingly, if any of the plaintiffs are successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the completion of the merger, then that injunction may prevent the merger from becoming effective, or delay its becoming effective.
We may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the proposed merger.
The success of the proposed merger will depend on, among other things, our ability to combine our business with that of Cameron in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and realizes anticipated synergies. However, we must successfully combine both businesses in a manner that permits these benefits to be realized. In addition, we must achieve the anticipated synergies without 
10
 

adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth. If we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully, may take longer to realize than expected, or may never be realized.
Potential issues and difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include the following:




 

·

difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex combined company;




 

·

lost sales and customers as a result of certain customers of either or both of the two companies deciding not to do business with the combined company, or deciding to decrease their level of business in order to reduce their reliance on a single company;




 

·

integrating personnel from the two companies while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high quality products and customer service;




 

·

potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the merger; and




 

·

performance shortfalls at one or both of the two companies as a result of the diversion of management’s attention caused by completing the merger and integrating the companies’ operations.
Business issues currently faced by Cameron may impact our operations.
To the extent that Cameron currently has or is perceived by customers to have operational challenges, such as on-time performance, safety issues or workforce issues, those challenges may raise concerns by our existing customers following the merger, which may limit or impede our future ability to obtain additional work from those customers.
