    We are an independent oil and gas company engaged in the
    exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas
    properties. Our domestic areas of operation include the Anadarko
    and Arkoma Basins of the Mid-Continent, the Rocky Mountains,
    onshore Texas and the Gulf of Mexico. Internationally, we are
    also active in Malaysia and China.

    Overview


 


    We are a Delaware corporation and were founded in 1989. Our
    company began as a Gulf of Mexico focused company. Over the last
    decade, we have diversified our asset base and added multiple
    areas capable of sustainable growth. Our asset base and related
    capital programs are diversified both geographically and by
    type — offshore and onshore, domestic and
    international, conventional plays and unconventional
    “resource” plays in both oil and gas basins.
    Approximately 80% of our proved reserves and 85% of our probable
    reserves at year-end 2009 were located in resource plays,
    primarily in the Mid-Continent and the Rocky Mountains.
    Approximately 60% of our 2009 capital investments were allocated
    to growth opportunities in these regions. We expect our 2010
    investment levels in these areas to be similar.


 


    At year-end 2009, we had proved reserves of 3.6 Tcfe, a 23%
    increase over proved reserves at year-end 2008. At the end of
    2009, our proved reserves were 72% natural gas and 53% proved
    developed. Our probable reserves were 70% natural gas. As a
    result of our focus on resource plays, our year-end 2009 proved
    reserve life index was approximately 14 years. Our 2009
    production was 257 Bcfe.

    Strategy


 


    Our growth strategy has evolved since our company was founded in
    1989 and has allowed us to move into new unconventional plays,
    lengthen our reserves life and build a portfolio capable of
    sustainable future growth. Our strategy today consists of the
    following key elements:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    focusing on unconventional, domestic resource plays of scale,
    characterized by large acreage positions and deep inventories of
    low risk drilling opportunities;




 



     
        • 

    
    growing reserves through an active drilling program,
    supplemented with select acquisitions;




 



     
        • 

    
    focusing on select geographic areas and allocating capital to
    the best growth opportunities;




 



     
        • 

    
    controlling operations and costs; and




 



     
        • 

    
    attracting and retaining a quality workforce through equity
    ownership and other performance-based incentives.

    Focus on Unconventional Resource Plays of
    Scale.  Over the last several years, our
    industry has increased its focus on unconventional resources. We
    have been no exception and now own interests in more than
    1 million gross acres in resource plays. These plays cover
    large acreage positions and have years of lower-risk drilling
    opportunities. Their development allows for efficiency gains in
    the drilling and completion processes, as well as sustainable
    and repeatable growth profiles. Our unconventional resource
    plays include producing positions in the Woodford Shale of
    Oklahoma, the Granite Wash of Texas, the Uinta Basin of Utah and
    the Eagle Ford and Pearsall Shales of southwest Texas. We also
    have leased acreage in the Marcellus Shale of Pennsylvania and
    the Southern Alberta Basin of Montana.


 


    Drilling Program.  The components of our
    drilling program reflect the significant changes in our asset
    base over the last few years. To manage the risks associated
    with our strategy to grow reserves through our drilling
    programs, a substantial majority of the wells we drilled in 2009
    were lower-risk with low to moderate reserve potential. We have
    lower-risk drilling opportunities in the Mid-Continent, the
    Rocky Mountains and the shallow waters of Malaysia. These
    opportunities are complemented with higher-risk, higher reserve
    potential plays in deepwater areas like the Gulf of Mexico and
    Malaysia. We actively look for new drilling ideas on our
    existing property base and on properties that may be acquired.


 


    Acquisitions.  Acquisitions have
    consistently been a part of our strategy, particularly when
    entering new geographic regions. Since 2000, we have completed
    five significant acquisitions that led to the establishment of
    new focus areas onshore in the United States. We actively pursue
    acquisitions of proved oil and gas properties in select
    geographic areas, including those areas where we currently
    focus. The potential to add reserves through drilling is a
    critical consideration in our acquisition screening process. See
    “Recent Developments” below.


 


    Geographic Focus.  We believe that our
    long-term success requires extensive knowledge of the geologic
    and operating conditions in the areas where we operate. Because
    of this belief, we focus our efforts on a limited number of
    geographic areas where we can use our core competencies and have
    a significant influence on operations. Geographic focus also
    allows more efficient use of capital and personnel.


 


    Control of Operations and Costs.  In
    general, we prefer to operate our properties. By controlling
    operations, we can better manage production performance, control
    operating expenses and capital expenditures, consider the
    application of technologies and influence timing. At year-end
    2009, we operated a significant portion of our net total
    production.


 


    Equity Ownership and Incentive
    Compensation.  We want our employees to act
    like owners, so we reward and encourage them through equity
    ownership and performance-based compensation. A large portion of
    our employees’ compensation is tied to our performance.


 




    2010
    Outlook and Capital Investments


 


    Our 2010 capital budget is $1.6 billion, including
    approximately $124 million of estimated capitalized
    interest and overhead. We expect our 2010 production to grow
    8-12% over 2009 levels. Our diversified portfolio of assets
    provides us with flexibility in our capital allocation process.
    We have the operational flexibility to react quickly with our
    capital expenditures to changes in our cash flows from
    operations.


 


    For 2010, approximately 70% of our natural gas production and
    40% of our oil production is hedged. For a complete discussion
    of our hedging activities, a listing of open contracts as of
    December 31, 2009 and the estimated fair value of these
    contracts as of that date, see Note 5, “Derivative
    Financial Instruments,” to our consolidated financial
    statements.

    Our
    Properties and Plans for 2010


 



    Resource
    Plays


 


    A key element of our strategy is to focus on domestic,
    unconventional resource plays of scale. These plays represent
    approximately 80% of our proved reserves and 85% of our probable
    reserves at year-end 2009.


 


    Mid-Continent.  Our largest business
    unit in terms of production, reserves and capital investment is
    the Mid-Continent. It has been our fastest growing business unit
    over the last several years. We are focused primarily in the
    Anadarko and Arkoma Basins. As of December 31, 2009, we
    owned a working interest in approximately 725,000 gross
    acres (approximately 400,000 net acres) and approximately
    2,300 gross producing wells. This region is characterized
    by longer-lived natural gas production.


 


    Woodford Shale.  Our largest single investment
    area over the last several years has been the Woodford Shale in
    our Mid-Continent division, located in the Arkoma Basin of
    southeast Oklahoma. The Woodford is a shale formation that
    varies in thickness from 100 to 200 feet throughout our
    acreage. Our activities began in this area in 2003. At year-end
    2009, we owned an interest in approximately 166,500 net
    acres. Our average working interest is approximately 60%. Since
    2003, we have drilled more than 100 vertical wells and
    approximately 300 horizontal wells. We are currently running
    eight operated rigs on the acreage and expect to run six to
    eight operated rigs throughout 2010.


 


    Our 2009 production in the Woodford Shale was 26% higher than
    our 2008 production, despite voluntary curtailments of
    approximately 3 Bcfe of natural gas production related to
    low gas prices in the second half of 2009. As of
    February 15, 2010, our operated production in the Woodford
    Shale was approximately 190 MMcfe/d net.


 


    We expect our production in the Woodford Shale to grow more than
    25% during 2010. Substantially all of our acreage is
    held-by-production.
    Our development plans for the field include drilling several
    thousand wells on primarily
    40-acre
    spacing. We have improved efficiencies in the play through the
    drilling of horizontal wells with longer lateral completions.
    Our average lateral length has doubled since 2006 to a 2009
    average of approximately 5,000’, and we expect our average
    length to be approximately 6,000’ in 2010.


 


    Granite Wash.  We are active in the Granite
    Wash play located in the Anadarko Basin of northern Texas and
    western Oklahoma and have more than 44,000 net acres in the
    play. Our largest producing field in the Granite Wash is
    Stiles/Britt Ranch, where we operate and own an average 75%
    working interest. Although we have approximately 150 producing
    vertical wells in Stiles/Britt Ranch, our recent efforts have
    shifted to horizontal drilling. Since late 2008, we have drilled
    and completed 13 horizontal wells in the Granite Wash and the
    average initial production for these wells was approximately
    20 MMcfe/d (gross). During 2009, we ran three to four
    operated drilling rigs in the field with production as of
    February 15, 2010 of approximately 130 MMcfe/d net. We
    expect to continue this level of activity in the Granite Wash,
    and expect our production in the Granite Wash to grow more than
    25% during 2010. We have an inventory of approximately 250
    locations in the Granite Wash.


 


    Rocky Mountains.  As of
    December 31, 2009, we owned an interest in approximately
    1.4 million gross acres (1 million net acres) and more
    than 2,400 gross producing wells in the Rocky Mountains.
    Our assets in the Rocky Mountains are more than 70% oil and have
    long-lived production. Our efforts today are focused primarily
    on oil plays in the Uinta, Williston and Southern Alberta Basins.


 


    Monument Butte.  Our largest asset in the Rocky
    Mountains is the Monument Butte oil field, located in the Uinta
    Basin of Utah. Our working interest in the field averages about
    80% and we operate the field, which is substantially
    held-by-production.
    The field accounted for approximately 20% of our year-end 2009
    proved reserves. We have approximately 1,300 productive oil
    wells in Monument Butte. Our acreage in this region is
    approximately 180,000 net acres. This includes
    63,000 net acres that we have added over the last two years
    through several transactions with Ute Energy LLC. These lands
    adjoin Monument Butte at the field’s northern edge. Since
    2008, we have drilled approximately 75 wells on the Ute
    acreage. Our gross production from the Monument Butte field area
    has grown from 7,000 BOPD in 2004 to a February 15,
    2010 rate of approximately 17,000 BOPD gross. In 2010, we are
    planning to drill a substantial portion of the acreage on
    20-acre

    development spacing and estimate that we have thousands of
    remaining locations in the Monument Butte field area. There is a
    significant gas resource beneath the shallow producing oil zones
    at Monument Butte. In 2008, we participated in the drilling of
    six successful deep test wells to evaluate these deeper
    formations. Our 2010 plans include drilling our first horizontal
    well to test these deep gas objectives beneath Monument Butte.


 


    Williston Basin/Southern Alberta Basin.  We
    have approximately 150,000 net acres in the Williston
    Basin, excluding approximately 54,000 net acres in the
    mature Elm Coulee field. To date, we have drilled 14 successful
    wells with production from the Bakken and Sanish/Three Forks
    formations. Our production at year-end 2009 was approximately
    2,500 BOEPD net. We plan to run three operated rigs in 2010 and
    expect production in the Williston Basin to grow more than 40%
    during the year. We have an inventory of approximately 80
    development locations primarily along the Nesson Anticline. In
    late 2009, we reached an agreement with the Blackfeet Nation
    covering approximately 156,000 net acres in the Southern
    Alberta Basin of northern Montana. Including this recent
    transaction, we now have approximately 221,000 net acres in
    the Southern Alberta Basin. Our 2010 plans include drilling up
    to 10 wells in the Southern Alberta Basin.


 


    Green River Basin.  We own interests in
    4,000 net acres in the Pinedale Field, located in Sublette
    County, Wyoming and operate our activities in Pinedale. We also
    have an interest in the Jonah field, located in Sublette County,
    Wyoming, where we have identified about 35 development locations
    on 10- and
    5-acre well
    spacing. Although we halted our activities in the Green River
    Basin with lower gas prices in 2009, we see the potential to
    drill approximately 120 additional locations as field spacing
    decreases to 20 acres and eventually to 10 acres. With
    improved realized gas prices in 2010, our activities here may
    resume in 2010.


 


    Appalachia.  In mid-2009, we signed a
    joint exploration agreement with Hess Corporation covering up to
    140,000 gross acres in the Marcellus Shale play, primarily
    in Wayne County, Pennsylvania. We are the operator of this
    venture with a 50% working interest. At year-end 2009, we had
    leased about 35,000 net acres. This marked our entry into
    the Marcellus — one of the nation’s largest
    resource plays. The Marcellus is economically advantaged due to
    its close proximity to the gas markets of the Northeast. We are
    permitting our initial wells and expect to drill 6-10 assessment
    wells in 2010 to test for commercial quantities of gas, evaluate
    acreage and core data while determining how best to develop our
    acreage.


 



    Conventional
    Plays


 


    We also have operations in conventional plays onshore Texas, in
    the Gulf of Mexico and offshore Malaysia and China.


 


    Onshore Texas.  As of December 31,
    2009, we owned an interest in approximately 375,000 gross
    acres (224,000 net) and about 750 gross producing wells
    onshore Texas. We slowed our activities in many of our
    conventional natural gas plays onshore Texas in 2009 in response
    to lower natural gas prices. At year-end 2009, we were producing
    approximately 170 MMcfe/d net from our onshore Texas
    assets. With planned decreased investments in 2010 and natural
    declines, we expect production from this area to decline
    approximately 15% during 2010. However, production from our
    recently acquired assets from TXCO Resources Inc.
    (“TXCO”) will add to our production, which should
    cause our 2010 production from onshore Texas to remain
    relatively flat. Our acquisition of assets from TXCO was our
    entry into the Maverick Basin of southwest Texas. We have
    multiple potential geologic targets for future development,
    primarily in the Eagle Ford and Pearsall Shales. See
    “Recent Developments” below.


 


    Gulf of Mexico.  Our Gulf of Mexico
    operations are focused on the deepwater. At year-end 2009, our
    daily production from the Gulf of Mexico was approximately
    90 MMcfe/d net. We have five active deepwater developments
    underway that we expect will lead to significant future
    production growth. As of December 31, 2009, we owned
    interests in 86 deepwater leases and approximately
    370,000 net acres. We have an inventory of prospects
    acquired primarily through federal lease sales over the last
    several years and we expect to drill three to five wells per
    year for the next several years. Our working interests typically
    range from
    20-50%. We
    expect our Gulf of Mexico production to grow more than 60%
    during 2010.


 


    International.  Our international
    activities are focused in Southeast Asia. We have production and
    active developments offshore Malaysia and China. Our
    international production at year-end 2009 was approximately





    
    5



Table of Contents





    17,000 BOPD net. We have an interest in approximately
    3 million acres gross (1.1 million net) offshore
    Malaysia and approximately 1.7 million acres gross
    (1.6 million net) offshore China. In 2010, our plans
    include continued development of our oil fields offshore
    Malaysia. During 2010, we also plan to develop our 2009
    “Pearl” discovery in the Pearl River Mouth Basin of
    China and plan to drill two exploratory commitment wells
    offshore China. We expect our international production to
    decline approximately 20% in 2010.



 



    Recent
    Developments


 


    On February 11, 2010, we acquired certain of TXCO’s
    assets in the Maverick Basin of southwest Texas for
    $215 million. The assets we acquired include approximately
    300,000 net acres and current net production of
    approximately 1,500 BOEPD, of which approximately two-thirds is
    oil.



 



    Concentration


 


    Reserves.  The table below sets forth
    the concentration of our proved and probable reserves, by
    location, and the percentage of those reserves attributable to
    our largest fields. Our largest fields, the Woodford Shale and
    Monument Butte, accounted for about 40% of the total net present
    value of our proved reserves at December 31, 2009.

    Proved
    and Probable Reserves


 


    All reserve information in this report is based on estimates
    prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and is the
    responsibility of management. The preparation of our oil and gas
    reserves estimates is completed in accordance with our
    prescribed internal control procedures, which include
    verification of data input into reserves forecasting and
    economics evaluation software, as well as multi-discipline
    management reviews, as described below. The technical employee
    responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserves
    estimates has a Bachelor of Science in Petroleum Engineering,
    with more than 25 years of experience (including
    15 years of experience in reserve estimation) and is a
    Registered Professional Engineer in Texas.


 


    Our reserves estimates are made using available geological and
    reservoir data as well as production performance data. These
    estimates, made by our petroleum engineering staff, are reviewed
    annually with management and revised, either upward or downward,
    as warranted by additional data. The data reviewed includes,
    among other things, seismic data, well logs, production tests,
    reservoir pressures, individual well and field performance data.
    The data incorporated into our interpretations includes
    structure and isopach maps, individual well and field
    performance and other engineering and geological work products
    such as material balance calculations and reservoir simulation
    to arrive at conclusions about individual well and field
    projections. Additionally, offset performance data, operating
    expenses, capital costs and product prices factor into
    estimating quantities of reserves. Revisions are necessary due
    to changes in, among other things, reservoir performance,
    prices, economic conditions and governmental regulations, as
    well as changes in the expected recovery rates associated with
    infill drilling. Sustained decreases in prices, for example, may
    cause a reduction in some reserves due to reaching economic
    limits sooner.


 


    Actual quantities of reserves recovered will most likely vary
    from the estimates set forth below. Reserves and cash flow
    estimates rely on interpretations of data and require
    assumptions that may be inaccurate. For a discussion of these
    interpretations and assumptions, see “Actual quantities
    of oil and gas reserves and future cash flows from those
    reserves will most likely vary from our estimates”
    under Item 1A of this report. Our estimates of proved
    reserves, proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped
    reserves and future net cash flows and discounted future net
    cash flows from proved reserves at December 31, 2009, 2008
    and 2007 and changes in proved reserves during the last three
    years are contained in “Supplementary Financial
    Information — Supplementary Oil and Gas
    Disclosures — Estimated Net Quantities of Proved Oil
    and Gas Reserves” in Item 8 of this report. For a
    discussion of the significant changes in our proved reserves
    during 2009, please see the information set forth in
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Proved
    Reserves” in Item 7 of this report.

    Proved Reserves.  Our year-end 2009
    proved reserves of 3.6 Tcfe increased 23% as compared to
    our proved reserves at year-end 2008, and consisted of
    1,505 Bcfe proved developed producing, 403 Bcfe proved
    developed non-producing and 1,708 Bcfe proved undeveloped
    reserves. Our 2009 proved reserves include 693 Bcfe of
    additions resulting from the change in the Securities and
    Exchange Commission (“SEC”) definition of proved
    reserves, expanding proved undeveloped reserve locations beyond
    one direct offset away from producing wells if such locations
    meet the definition of proved reserves.


 


    At December 31, 2008 our estimated proved undeveloped
    reserves were 1,124 Bcfe. During 2009, we spent
    $364 million of drilling, completion and
    facilities-related
    capital to convert 123 Bcfe of our December 31, 2008
    proved undeveloped reserves into proved developed reserves.
    Another 275 Bcfe of our beginning of year proved
    undeveloped reserves were removed from the proved undeveloped
    category during 2009, substantially all of which were no longer
    economic utilizing a natural gas price of $3.87 per MMBtu for
    our year-end 2009 reserve calculations. During 2009, we added
    289 Bcfe of new proved undeveloped reserves through
    drilling activities. Additionally, we added 693 Bcfe of
    proved undeveloped reserves as a result of the change in the SEC
    definition of proved reserves expanding proved undeveloped
    reserve locations beyond one direct offset away from producing
    wells. These additions were primarily in our Woodford Shale and
    Monument Butte fields. Proved undeveloped reserve quantities
    were limited by the activity level of development drilling we
    expect to undertake during the
    2010-2014
    five-year period. Quantities of reserves that would otherwise
    meet the definition of proved undeveloped reserves except for
    the fact that they will be developed beyond the
    2010-2014
    five-year horizon (904 Bcfe) have been classified as
    probable reserves, in accordance with SEC regulations. As a
    result of the foregoing, our proved undeveloped reserves at
    December 31, 2009 were 1,708 Bcfe, 98% of which have
    been included in our reserve report for less than five years.
    For additional information regarding the changes in our proved
    reserves, see “Proved Reserves” under Item 7 of this
    report.


 


    Probable Reserves.  Our probable
    reserves at year-end 2009 consisted of 101 Bcfe developed
    and 1,792 Bcfe of undeveloped reserves. Included in our
    undeveloped probable reserves are 904 Bcfe that would
    otherwise meet the definition of proved undeveloped reserves
    except for the fact that they will not be developed during the
    2010-2014
    five-year horizon. A significant portion of these probable
    reserves are associated with our Woodford Shale activities.

    Reserves Sensitivities.  To determine
    our year-end 2009 reserves estimates, we utilized the unweighted
    average
    first-day-of-the-month
    natural gas and crude oil prices for the prior twelve months, or
    $3.87 per MMBtu and $61.14 per barrel, respectively, adjusted
    for market differentials. In 2009, we experienced low average
    natural gas prices and, as a result, the estimated future net
    cash flows from our proved reserves are substantially lower than
    at year-end 2008 on a unit-of-reserve basis, but are
    substantially offset by higher quantities of proved reserves.
    The table below illustrates changes in the quantities of proved
    and probable reserves at various price scenarios, holding all
    other year-end reserve assumptions constant.

    Our proved reserves increase at higher prices primarily as a
    result of extending the economic life of our proved developed
    reserves. Higher realized prices do not materially increase the
    quantity of our proved undeveloped reserves because it is
    limited by the level of development drilling we expect to
    undertake during the 2010-2014 five-year period. This limitation
    impacts our Woodford Shale (natural gas) and our Monument Butte
    field (crude oil) developments because of their size.


 


    Our probable reserves increase approximately 500 Bcfe
    utilizing a $5.00 per MMBtu natural gas price instead of a $3.87
    per MMBtu natural gas price, with no change in oil prices. The
    increase is attributable to quantities of reserves associated
    with our Woodford Shale activities that are not commercial at a
    $3.87 per MMBtu natural gas price. These probable reserves would
    meet the definition of proved undeveloped reserves except for
    the fact that they would be developed beyond the
    2010-2014
    five-year horizon. Accordingly, a total of approximately
    1,404 Bcfe,  or 60%, of our probable reserves at a $5.00
    per MMBtu natural gas price would meet the definition of proved
    undeveloped reserves except for the fact that they would be
    developed beyond the
    2010-2014
    five-year horizon.


 


    Our proved reserves decrease at lower crude oil prices as a
    result of shortening the economic life of our proved developed
    reserves. Crude oil prices at the levels shown in the table
    above would not change our development plans and, therefore,
    have no impact on the quantity of proved undeveloped reserves
    because that quantity is limited by the level of development
    drilling we expect to undertake during the 2010-2014
    five-year
    period. Our proved undeveloped oil reserves lie primarily in our
    Monument Butte field.


 


    Under the terms of our production sharing contracts in Malaysia
    and China, an increase or decrease in realized oil prices would
    result in a decrease or increase, respectively, in our proved
    reserves. At higher oil prices, lesser quantities of oil are
    required for cost recovery and at lower oil prices greater
    quantities of oil are required for cost recovery. Our share (the
    contractor’s share) of future production is impacted
    accordingly. The effect of higher or lower oil prices may be
    partially offset by extending or shortening, respectively, the
    economic life of proved reserves.

    The
    day-to-day
    operations of oil and gas properties are the responsibility of
    an operator designated under pooling or operating agreements or
    production sharing contracts. The operator supervises
    production, maintains production records, employs or contracts
    for field personnel and performs other functions. Generally, an
    operator receives reimbursement for direct expenses incurred in
    the performance of its duties as well as monthly per-well
    producing and drilling overhead reimbursement at rates
    customarily charged by unaffiliated third parties. The charges
    customarily vary with the depth and location of the well being
    operated.

    Acreage
    Data


 


    As of December 31, 2009, we owned interests in developed
    and undeveloped oil and gas acreage set forth in the table
    below. Domestic ownership interests generally take the form of
    “working interests” in oil and gas leases that have
    varying terms. International ownership interests generally arise
    from participation in production sharing contracts.

    The table below summarizes by year and geographic area our
    undeveloped acreage scheduled to expire in the next five years.
    In most cases, the drilling of a commercial well, or the filing
    and approval of a development plan or suspension of operations,
    will hold acreage beyond the expiration date. We own fee mineral
    interests in 374,480 gross (107,040 net) undeveloped acres.
    These interests do not expire.

    Title to
    Properties


 


    We believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our
    producing properties in accordance with generally accepted
    industry standards. Individual properties may be subject to
    burdens such as royalty, overriding royalty, carried, net
    profits, working and other outstanding interests customary in
    the industry. In addition, interests may be subject to
    obligations or duties under applicable laws or burdens such as
    production payments, ordinary course liens incidental to
    operating agreements and for current taxes, development
    obligations under oil and gas leases or capital commitments
    under production sharing contracts or exploration licenses. As
    is customary in the industry in the case of undeveloped
    properties, often little investigation of record title is made
    at the time of acquisition. Investigations are made prior to the
    consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and
    before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped
    properties.



 



    Marketing


 


    Substantially all of our oil and gas production is sold to a
    variety of purchasers under short-term (less than
    12 months) contracts at market sensitive prices. For a list
    of purchasers of our oil and gas production that accounted for
    10% or more of our consolidated revenue for the three preceding
    calendar years, please see Note 1, “Organization and
    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Major
    Customers,” to our consolidated financial statements.
    We believe that the loss of any of these purchasers would not
    have a material adverse effect on us because alternative
    purchasers are readily available with the exception of
    purchasers of our Monument Butte field oil production. Due to
    the higher paraffin content of this production, there is limited
    refining capacity for it. Please see the discussion under
    “There is limited refining capacity for our black wax
    crude oil, which may limit our ability to sell our current
    production or to increase our production at Monument Butte in
    the Uinta Basin” in Item 1A of this report.



 



    Competition


 


    Competition in the oil and gas industry is intense, particularly
    with respect to the hiring and retention of technical personnel,
    the acquisition of properties and access to drilling rigs and
    other services in the Gulf of Mexico. For a further discussion,
    please see the information regarding competition set forth in
    Item 1A of this report.



 



    Employees


 


    As of February 22, 2010, we had 1,148 employees. All but
    101 of our employees were located in the U.S. None of our
    employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We
    believe that relationships with our employees are satisfactory.



 



    Regulation


 


    Exploration and development and the production and sale of oil
    and gas are subject to extensive federal, state, local and
    international regulations. An overview of these regulations is
    set forth below. We believe we are in substantial compliance
    with currently applicable laws and regulations and that
    continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will
    not have a material adverse effect on our financial position,
    cash flows or results of operations. However, current regulatory
    requirements may change, currently unforeseen environmental
    incidents may occur or past non-compliance with environmental
    laws or regulations may be discovered. Please see the discussion
    under the caption “We are subject to complex laws that
    can affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business. In
    addition, potential regulatory actions could increase our costs
    and reduce our liquidity, delay our operations or otherwise
    alter the way we conduct our business.” in Item 1A
    of this report.


 


    Federal Regulation of Sales and Transportation of Natural
    Gas.  Our sales of natural gas are affected
    directly or indirectly by the availability, terms and cost of
    natural gas transportation. The prices and terms for access to
    pipeline transportation of natural gas are subject to extensive
    federal and state regulation. The transportation and sale for
    resale of natural gas in interstate commerce is regulated
    primarily under the Natural





    
    14



Table of Contents





    Gas Act (“NGA”) and by regulations and orders
    promulgated under the NGA by the FERC. In certain limited
    circumstances, intrastate transportation and wholesale sales of
    natural gas may also be affected directly or indirectly by laws
    enacted by Congress and by FERC regulations. The Outer
    Continental Shelf Lands Act, or OCSLA, requires that all
    pipelines operating on or across the shelf provide open-access,
    non-discriminatory service. There are currently no regulations
    implemented by the FERC under its OCSLA authority on gatherers
    and other entities outside the reach of its Natural Gas Act
    jurisdiction. Therefore, we do not believe that any FERC or MMS
    action taken under OCSLA will affect us in a way that materially
    differs from the way it will affect other natural gas producers,
    gatherers and marketers with which we compete.


 


    Pursuant to authority enacted in the Energy Policy Act of 2005
    (“2005 EPA”), FERC has promulgated anti-manipulation
    regulations, violations of which make it unlawful for any
    entity, directly or indirectly, in connection with the purchase
    or sale of natural gas or the purchase or sale of transportation
    services subject to the jurisdiction of FERC to use or employ
    any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud, to make any untrue
    statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact
    necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of
    the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or
    to engage in any act, practice, or course of business that
    operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any entity.
    Violation of this requirement, similar to violations of other
    NGA and FERC requirements, may be penalized by the FERC up to
    $1 million per day per violation. FERC may also order
    disgorgement of profit and corrective action. We believe,
    however, that neither the 2005 EPA nor the regulations
    promulgated by FERC as a result of the 2005 EPA will affect us
    in a way that materially differs from the way they affect other
    natural gas producers, gatherers and marketers with which we
    compete.


 


    Our sales of natural gas and crude are also subject to
    requirements under Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”) and
    regulations promulgated thereunder by the Commodity Futures
    Trading Commission (“CFTC”). The CEA prohibits any
    person from manipulating or attempting to manipulate the price
    of any commodity in interstate commerce or futures on such
    commodity. The CEA also prohibits knowingly delivering or
    causing to be delivered false or misleading or knowingly
    inaccurate reports concerning market information or conditions
    that affect or tend to affect the price of a commodity.


 


    The current statutory and regulatory framework governing
    interstate natural gas transactions is subject to change in the
    future, and the nature of such changes is impossible to predict.
    Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the
    natural gas industry are pending before Congress, the FERC, the
    CFTC and the courts. The natural gas industry historically has
    been very heavily regulated. In the past, the federal government
    regulated the prices at which natural gas could be sold.
    Congress removed all price and non-price controls affecting
    wellhead sales of natural gas effective January 1, 1993.
    There is always some risk, however, that Congress may reenact
    price controls in the future. Changes in law and to FERC
    policies and regulations may adversely affect the availability
    and reliability of firm
    and/or
    interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines,
    and we cannot predict what future action the FERC will take.
    Therefore, there is no assurance that the current regulatory
    approach recently pursued by the FERC and Congress will
    continue. We do not believe, however, that any regulatory
    changes will affect us in a way that materially differs from the
    way they will affect other natural gas producers, gatherers and
    marketers with which we compete.


 


    Federal Regulation of Sales and Transportation of Crude
    Oil.  Our sales of crude oil and condensate
    are currently not regulated. In a number of instances, however,
    the ability to transport and sell such products are dependent on
    pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are
    subject to FERC jurisdiction under the Interstate Commerce Act.
    Certain regulations implemented by the FERC in recent years
    could result in an increase in the cost of transportation
    service on certain petroleum products pipelines. However, we do
    not believe that these regulations affect us any differently
    than other crude oil and condensate producers.


 


    Federal Leases.  Many of our domestic
    oil and gas leases are granted by the federal government and
    administered by the MMS or the BLM, both federal agencies. MMS
    and BLM leases contain relatively standardized terms and require
    compliance with detailed BLM or MMS regulations and, in the case
    of offshore leases, orders pursuant to OCSLA (which are subject
    to change by the MMS). Many onshore leases contain stipulations
    limiting activities that may be conducted on the lease. Some
    stipulations are unique to particular geographic areas and may
    limit the time during which activities on the lease may be
    conducted, the manner in





    
    15



Table of Contents





    which certain activities may be conducted or, in some cases, may
    ban surface activity. For offshore operations, lessees must
    obtain MMS approval for exploration, development and production
    plans prior to the commencement of such operations. In addition
    to permits required from other agencies (such as the Coast
    Guard, the Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental
    Protection Agency), lessees must obtain a permit from the BLM or
    the MMS, as applicable, prior to the commencement of drilling,
    and comply with regulations governing, among other things,
    engineering and construction specifications for production
    facilities, safety procedures, plugging and abandonment of wells
    on the Shelf and removal of facilities. To cover the various
    obligations of lessees on the Shelf, the MMS generally requires
    that lessees have substantial net worth or post bonds or other
    acceptable assurances that such obligations will be met. The
    cost of such bonds or other surety can be substantial and there
    is no assurance that bonds or other surety can be obtained in
    all cases. We are currently exempt from the supplemental bonding
    requirements of the MMS. Under certain circumstances, the BLM or
    the MMS, as applicable, may require that our operations on
    federal leases be suspended or terminated. Any such suspension
    or termination could materially and adversely affect our
    financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.


 


    The MMS regulations governing the calculation of royalties and
    the valuation of crude oil produced from federal leases provide
    that the MMS will collect royalties based upon the market value
    of oil produced from federal leases. The 2005 EPA formalizes the
    royalty in-kind program of the MMS, providing that the MMS may
    take royalties in-kind if the Secretary of the Interior
    determines that the benefits are greater than or equal to the
    benefits that are likely to have been received had royalties
    been taken in value. We believe that the MMS’s royalty
    in-kind program will not have a material effect on our financial
    position, cash flows or results of operations.


 


    In 2006, the MMS amended its regulations to require additional
    filing fees. The MMS has estimated that these additional filing
    fees will represent less than 0.1% of the revenues of companies
    with offshore operations in most cases. We do not believe that
    these additional filing fees will affect us in a way that
    materially differs from the way they affect other producers,
    gatherers and marketers with which we compete.


 


    State and Local Regulation of Drilling and
    Production.  We own interests in properties
    located onshore in a number of states and in state waters
    offshore Texas and Louisiana. These states regulate drilling and
    operating activities by requiring, among other things, permits
    for the drilling of wells, maintaining bonding requirements in
    order to drill or operate wells, and regulating the location of
    wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use
    and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled and
    the plugging and abandonment of wells. The laws of these states
    also govern a number of environmental and conservation matters,
    including the handling and disposing or discharge of waste
    materials, the size of drilling and spacing units or proration
    units and the density of wells that may be drilled, unitization
    and pooling of oil and gas properties and establishment of
    maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells. Some states
    have the power to prorate production to the market demand for
    oil and gas.


 


    Environmental Regulations.  Our
    operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations
    governing the discharge of materials into the environment or
    otherwise relating to environmental protection. The cost of
    compliance could be significant. Failure to comply with these
    laws and regulations may result in the assessment of
    administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of
    remedial and damage payment obligations, or the issuance of
    injunctive relief (including orders to cease operations).
    Environmental laws and regulations are complex, and have tended
    to become more stringent over time. We also are subject to
    various environmental permit requirements. Both onshore and
    offshore drilling in certain areas has been opposed by
    environmental groups and, in certain areas, has been restricted.
    Moreover, some environmental laws and regulations may impose
    strict liability, which could subject us to liability for
    conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or conduct or
    conditions caused by prior operators or third parties. To the
    extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken
    that prohibits or restricts onshore or offshore drilling or
    imposes environmental protection requirements that result in
    increased costs to the oil and gas industry in general, our
    business and financial results could be adversely affected.


 


    The Oil Pollution Act, or OPA, imposes regulations on
    “responsible parties” related to the prevention of oil
    spills and liability for damages resulting from spills in
    U.S. waters. A “responsible party” includes the





    
    16



Table of Contents





    owner or operator of an onshore facility, vessel or pipeline, or
    the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore
    facility is located. OPA assigns strict, joint and several
    liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a
    variety of public and private damages. While liability limits
    apply in some circumstances, a party cannot take advantage of
    such limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or
    willful misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal
    safety, construction or operating regulation, or if the party
    fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in the cleanup.
    Even if applicable, the liability limits for offshore facilities
    require the responsible party to pay all removal costs, plus up
    to $75 million in other damages for offshore facilities and
    up to $350 million for onshore facilities. Few defenses
    exist to the liability imposed by OPA. Failure to comply with
    ongoing requirements or inadequate cooperation during a spill
    event may subject a responsible party to administrative, civil
    or criminal enforcement actions.


 


    OPA also requires operators in the Gulf of Mexico to demonstrate
    to the MMS that they possess available financial resources that
    are sufficient to pay for costs that may be incurred in
    responding to an oil spill. Under OPA and implementing MMS
    regulations, responsible parties are required to demonstrate
    that they possess financial resources sufficient to pay for
    environmental cleanup and restoration costs of at least
    $10 million for an oil spill in state waters and at least
    $35 million for an oil spill in federal waters.


 


    In addition to OPA, our discharges to waters of the
    U.S. are further limited by the federal Clean Water Act, or
    CWA, and analogous state laws. The CWA prohibits any discharge
    into waters of the United States except in compliance with
    permits issued by federal and state governmental agencies.
    Failure to comply with the CWA, including discharge limits set
    by permits issued pursuant to the CWA, may also result in
    administrative, civil or criminal enforcement actions. The OPA
    and CWA also require the preparation of oil spill response plans
    and spill prevention, control and countermeasure or
    “SPCC” plans. We have such plans in place and have
    made changes as necessary due to changes by the
    U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, also known as the
    “EPA,” and delays in EPA rulemaking. The final EPA
    rule was published in November 2009 and became effective on
    January 14, 2010, with a compliance deadline of November
    2010.


 


    OCSLA authorizes regulations relating to safety and
    environmental protection applicable to lessees and permittees
    operating on the Shelf. Specific design and operational
    standards may apply to vessels, rigs, platforms, vehicles and
    structures operating or located on the Shelf. Violations of
    lease conditions or regulations issued pursuant to OCSLA can
    result in substantial administrative, civil and criminal
    penalties, as well as potential court injunctions curtailing
    operations and the cancellation of leases.


 


    The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, generally
    regulates the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and imposes
    certain environmental cleanup obligations. Although RCRA
    specifically excludes from the definition of hazardous waste
    “drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes
    associated with the exploration, development or production of
    crude oil, natural gas or geothermal energy,” the EPA and
    state agencies may regulate these wastes as solid wastes.
    Moreover, ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes,
    waste solvents, laboratory wastes and waste oils, may be
    regulated as hazardous waste.


 


    The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
    Liability Act, also known as CERCLA or the “Superfund”
    law, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard
    to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on persons
    that are considered to have contributed to the release of a
    “hazardous substance” into the environment. Such
    “responsible persons” may be subject to joint and
    several liability under the Superfund law for the costs of
    cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released
    into the environment and for damages to natural resources, and
    it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third
    parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage
    allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the
    environment. We currently own or lease onshore properties that
    have been used for the exploration and production of oil and gas
    for a number of years. Many of these onshore properties have
    been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or
    release of hydrocarbons or other wastes was not under our
    control. These properties and any wastes that may have been
    disposed or released on them may be subject to the Superfund
    law, RCRA and analogous state laws and common law obligations,
    and we potentially could be required to investigate and
    remediate such properties, including soil or groundwater
    contamination by prior owners or operators, or to perform
    remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future
    contamination.

    The Clean Air Act (“CAA” or the “Clean Air
    Act”) and comparable state statutes restrict the emission
    of air pollutants and affects both onshore and offshore oil and
    gas operations. New facilities may be required to obtain
    separate construction and operating permits before construction
    work can begin or operations may start, and existing facilities
    may be required to incur capital costs in order to remain in
    compliance. Also, the EPA has developed and continues to develop
    more stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air
    pollutants, and is considering the regulation of additional air
    pollutants and air pollutant parameters. These regulations may
    increase the costs of compliance for some facilities.


 


    The Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and
    comparable state statutes regulate the protection of the health
    and safety of workers. The OSHA hazard communication standard
    requires maintenance of information about hazardous materials
    used or produced in operations and provision of such information
    to employees. Other OSHA standards regulate specific worker
    safety aspects of our operations. Failure to comply with OSHA
    requirements can lead to the imposition of penalties.


 


    Congress has been actively considering legislation to reduce
    emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the development
    of greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. In June of 2009, the
    U.S. House of Representatives passed a cap and trade bill
    known as the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009,
    which is now being considered by the U.S. Senate. In
    addition, more than one-third of the states already have begun
    implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse
    gases. Further, on April 2, 2007, the United States Supreme
    Court in Massachusetts, et al. v. EPA, held that carbon
    dioxide may be regulated as an “air pollutant” under
    the federal Clean Air Act. On April 24, 2009, EPA responded
    to the Massachusetts, et al. v. EPA decision with a
    proposed finding that the current and projected concentrations
    of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threaten the public health
    and welfare of current and future generations, and that certain
    greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles and motor vehicle
    engines contribute to the atmospheric concentrations of
    greenhouse gases and hence to the threat of climate change. EPA
    published the final version of this finding on December 15,
    2009, which allowed EPA to proceed with the rulemaking process
    to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. In
    anticipation of the finalization of EPA’s finding that
    greenhouse gases threaten public health and welfare, and that
    greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles contribute to climate
    change, EPA proposed a rule in September of 2009 that would
    require a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor
    vehicles and would trigger applicability of Clean Air Act
    permitting requirements for certain stationary sources of
    greenhouse gas emissions. In response to this issue, EPA also
    proposed a tailoring rule that would, in general, only impose
    greenhouse gas permitting requirements on facilities that emit
    more than 25,000 tons per year of greenhouse gases. Moreover, on
    September 22, 2009, EPA finalized a rule requiring
    nation-wide reporting of greenhouse gas emissions in 2011 for
    emissions occurring in 2010. The rule applies primarily to large
    facilities emitting 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon
    dioxide-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions per year, and to
    most upstream suppliers of fossil fuels and industrial
    greenhouse gas, as well as to manufacturers of vehicles and
    engines. Although it is not possible at this time to predict
    whether proposed legislation or regulations will be adopted as
    initially written, if at all, or how legislation or new
    regulation that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas
    emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and
    regulations could result in increased compliance costs or
    additional operating restrictions. Any additional costs or
    operating restrictions associated with legislation or
    regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions could have a
    material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows,
    in addition to the demand for the natural gas and other
    hydrocarbon products that we produce.


 


    International Regulations.  Our
    exploration and production operations outside the United States
    are subject to various types of regulations similar to those
    described above imposed by the respective governments of the
    countries in which we operate, and may affect our operations and
    costs within that country. We currently have operations in
    Malaysia and China.



 



    Commonly
    Used Oil and Gas Terms


 


    Below are explanations of some commonly used terms in the oil

    water depths in excess of 1,000 feet.


 


    Developed acreage.  The number of acres
    that are allocated or assignable to producing wells or wells
    capable of production.

    Dry hole or well.  A well found to be
    incapable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities
    such that proceeds from the sale of such production exceed
    production expenses and taxes.


 


    Exploitation well.  An exploration well
    drilled to find and produce probable reserves. Most of the
    exploitation wells we drilled in 2007, 2008 and 2009 and expect
    to drill in 2010 are located in the Mid-Continent or the
    Monument Butte field. Exploitation wells in those areas have
    less risk and less reserve potential and typically may be
    drilled at a lower cost than other exploration wells. For
    internal reporting and budgeting purposes, we combine
    exploitation and development activities.


 


    Exploration well.  An exploration well
    is a well drilled to find a new field or to find a new reservoir
    in a field previously found to be productive of oil or gas in
    another reservoir. Generally, an exploratory well is any well
    that is not a development well, an extension well, a service
    well, or a stratigraphic test well. For internal reporting and
    budgeting purposes, we exclude exploitation activities from
    exploration activities.

    NYMEX Henry Hub.  Henry Hub is the major
    exchange for pricing natural gas futures on the New York
    Mercantile Exchange. It is frequently referred to as the Henry
    Hub Index.


 


    Probable reserves.  Probable reserves
    are those additional reserves that are less certain to be
    recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved
    reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. The SEC provides
    a complete definition of probable reserves in
    Rule 4-10(a)(18)
    of
    Regulation S-X.


 


    Productive well.  A well that is found
    to be capable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities
    such that proceeds from the sale of such production exceed
    production expenses and taxes.


 


    Proved developed reserves.  In general,
    proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered from
    existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods.
    The SEC provides a complete definition of developed oil and gas
    reserves in
    Rule 4-10(a)(6)
    of
    Regulation S-X.


 


    Proved reserves.  Proved reserves are
    those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of
    geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with
    reasonable certainty to be economically producible —
    from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under
    existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government
    regulations — prior to the time at which contracts
    providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates
    that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether
    deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the
    estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have
    commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it
    will commence the project within a reasonable time.


 


    Proved undeveloped reserves.  In
    general, proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from
    new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a
    relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. The
    SEC provides a complete definition of undeveloped oil and gas
    reserves in
    Rule 4-10(a)(31)
    of
    Regulation S-X.


 


    Reserve life index.  This index is
    calculated by dividing total proved reserves at year end by
    annual production to estimate the number of years of remaining
    production.


 


    Shelf.  The U.S. Outer Continental
    Shelf of the Gulf of Mexico. Water depths generally range from
    50 feet to 1,000 feet.


 


    Tcfe.  One trillion cubic feet

    to one barrel of crude oil or condensate.


 


    Unconventional “resource”
    plays.  Plays targeting tight sand, coal bed
    or gas shale reservoirs. The reservoirs tend to cover large
    areas and lack the readily apparent traps, seals and discrete
    hydrocarbon-water boundaries that typically define conventional
    reservoirs. These reservoirs generally require stimulation
    treatments or other special recovery processes in order to
    produce economically.


 


    Undeveloped acreage.  Lease acreage on
    which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that
    would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and
    gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves.


 


    Working interest.  The operating
    interest that gives the owner the right to drill, produce and
    conduct operating activities on the property and a share of
    production.

    Risk
    Factors





 


    There are many factors that may affect Newfield’s business
    and results of operations. You should carefully consider, in
    addition to the other information contained in this report, the
    risks described below.


 


    Oil and gas prices fluctuate widely, and lower prices for
    an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse
    impact on our business.  Our revenues,
    profitability and future growth depend substantially on
    prevailing prices for oil and gas. Lower prices may reduce the
    amount of oil and gas that we can economically produce. Oil and
    gas prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for
    capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise
    additional capital. The amount that we can borrow under our
    credit facility could be limited by changing expectations of
    future prices because the maximum amount that we may borrow
    under our credit facility is determined by our lenders annually
    each May, and may be adjusted at the option of our lenders in
    the case of certain acquisitions or divestitures, using a
    process that takes into account the value of our estimated
    reserves and hedge position and the lenders’ commodity
    price assumptions.


 


    Among the factors that can cause fluctuations in oil and gas
    prices are:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    the domestic and foreign supply of oil, natural gas and natural
    gas liquids;




 



     
        • 

    
    the price and availability of, and demand for, alternative fuels;




 



     
        • 

    
    weather conditions and climate change;




 



     
        • 

    
    changes in supply and demand;




 



     
        • 

    
    world-wide economic conditions;




 



     
        • 

    
    the price of foreign imports;




 



     
        • 

    
    the availability, proximity and capacity of transportation
    facilities and processing facilities;




 



     
        • 

    
    the level and effect of trading in commodity futures markets,
    including commodity price speculators and others;




 



     
        • 

    
    political conditions in oil and gas producing regions; and




 



     
        • 

    
    the nature and extent of domestic and foreign governmental
    regulations and taxation, including environmental regulation.





 


    We have substantial capital requirements to fund our
    business plans, and a slow recovery of the economy and the
    financial markets in 2010 or another decline or crisis as was
    experienced in late 2008 and 2009 could negatively impact our
    ability to execute our business
    plan.  Although we anticipate that our 2010
    capital spending, excluding acquisitions, will correspond with
    our anticipated 2010 cash flows, we may borrow and repay funds
    under our credit arrangements throughout the year since the
    timing of expenditures and the receipt of cash flows from
    operations do not necessarily match. Actual levels of capital
    expenditures may vary significantly due to many factors,
    including drilling results, oil and gas prices, industry
    conditions, the prices and availability of goods and services
    and the extent to which properties are acquired. In addition, in
    the past, we often have increased our capital budget during the
    year as a result of acquisitions or successful drilling. We may
    have to reduce capital expenditures, and our ability to execute
    our business plans could be adversely affected, if (1) one
    or more of the lenders under our existing credit arrangements
    fail to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us,
    (2) the amount that we are allowed to borrow under our
    existing credit facility is reduced as a result of lower oil and
    gas prices, declines in reserves, lending requirements or for
    other reasons or (3) our customers or working interest
    owners default on their obligations to us.


 


    Our use of oil and gas price hedging contracts may limit
    future revenues from price increases and involves the risk that
    our counterparties may be unable to satisfy their obligations to
    us.  We generally hedge a substantial, but
    varying, portion of our anticipated future oil and gas
    production for the next
    12-24 months
    as part of our risk management program. In the case of
    significant acquisitions, we may hedge acquired production for a
    longer period. In addition, we may utilize basis contracts to
    hedge the differential between the NYMEX Henry Hub posted prices
    and those of our physical pricing points. Reducing our





    
    21



Table of Contents





    exposure to price volatility is intended to help ensure that we
    have adequate funds available for our capital programs and to
    help us manage returns on some of our acquisitions and more
    price sensitive drilling programs. Although the use of hedging
    transactions limits the downside risk of price declines, it also
    may limit the benefit from price increases and expose us to the
    risk of financial loss in certain circumstances. Those
    circumstances include instances where our production is less
    than the hedged volume or there is a widening of price basis
    differentials between delivery points for our production and the
    delivery points assumed in the hedge transaction.


 


    Hedging transactions also involve the risk that counterparties,
    which generally are financial institutions, may be unable to
    satisfy their obligations to us. Although we have entered into
    hedging contracts with multiple counterparties to mitigate our
    exposure to any individual counterparty, if any of our
    counterparties were to default on its obligations to us under
    the hedging contracts or seek bankruptcy protection, it could
    have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our
    planned activities and could result in a larger percentage of
    our future production being subject to commodity price changes.
    In addition, in poor economic environments and tight financial
    markets, the risk of a counterparty default is heightened, and
    it is possible that fewer counterparties will participate in
    future hedging transactions, which could result in greater
    concentration of our exposure to any one counterparty or a
    larger percentage of our future production being subject to
    commodity price changes.


 


    To maintain and grow our production and cash flow, we must
    continue to develop existing reserves and locate or acquire new
    oil and gas reserves.  Through our drilling
    programs and the acquisition of properties, we strive to
    maintain and grow our production and cash flow. However, as we
    produce from our properties, our reserves decline. We may be
    unable to find, develop or acquire additional reserves or
    production at an acceptable cost, if at all. In addition, these
    activities require substantial capital expenditures.


 


    Actual quantities of oil and gas reserves and future cash
    flows from those reserves will most likely vary from our
    estimates.  Estimating accumulations of oil
    and gas is complex. The process relies on interpretations of
    available geologic, geophysic, engineering and production data.
    The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The
    process also requires a number of economic assumptions, such as
    oil and gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital
    expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. The accuracy of a
    reserve estimate is a function of:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    the quality and quantity of available data;




 



     
        • 

    
    the interpretation of that data;




 



     
        • 

    
    the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions; and




 



     
        • 

    
    the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate.





 


    The proved and probable reserve information set forth in this
    report is based on estimates we prepared. Estimates prepared by
    others might differ materially from our estimates.


 


    Actual quantities of oil and gas reserves, future production,
    oil and gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures
    and operating expenses will most likely vary from our estimates,
    with the variability likely to be higher for probable reserves
    estimates. In addition, the methodologies and evaluation
    techniques that we use, which include the use of multiple
    technologies, data sources and interpretation methods, may be
    different than those used by our competitors. Further, reserve
    estimates are subject to the evaluator’s criteria and
    judgment and show important variability, particularly in the
    early stages of an oil and gas development. Any significant
    variance could materially affect the quantities and net present
    value of our reserves. In addition, we may adjust estimates of
    reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration
    and development activities and prevailing oil and gas prices.
    Our reserves also may be susceptible to drainage by operators on
    adjacent properties.


 


    You should not assume that the present value of future net cash
    flows is the current market value of our proved oil and gas
    reserves. In accordance with new SEC requirements, we base the
    estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves
    on the unweighted average
    first-day-of-the-month
    commodity prices for the prior twelve months, adjusted for
    market differentials, and costs in effect at year-end. Actual





    
    22



Table of Contents





    future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than
    the prices and costs we used. In addition, actual production
    rates for future periods may vary significantly from the rates
    assumed in the calculation.


 


    There is limited refining capacity for our black wax crude
    oil, which may limit our ability to sell our current production
    or to increase our production at Monument Butte in the Uinta
    Basin.   Most of the crude oil we produce in
    the Uinta Basin is known as “black wax” because it has
    higher paraffin content than crude oil found in most other major
    North American basins. Due to its wax content, it must remain
    heated during shipping, so the oil is transported by truck to
    refiners in the Salt Lake City area. We currently have
    agreements in place with area refiners that secure base load
    sales of substantially all of our expected production in the
    Uinta Basin through the end of 2010. In the current economic
    environment, there is a risk that they may fail to satisfy their
    obligations to us under those contracts. During the fourth
    quarter of 2008, the largest purchaser of our black wax crude
    oil failed to pay for certain deliveries of crude oil and filed
    for bankruptcy protection. Although we continue to sell our
    black wax crude oil to that purchaser on a short-term basis that
    provides for more timely cash payments, we cannot guarantee that
    we will be able to continue to sell to this purchaser or that
    similar substitute arrangements could be made for sales of our
    black wax crude oil with other purchasers if desired. An
    extended loss of our largest purchaser could have a material
    adverse effect on us because there are limited purchasers of our
    black wax crude. We continue to work with refiners to expand the
    market for our existing black wax crude oil production and to
    secure additional capacity to allow for production growth.
    However, without additional refining capacity, our ability to
    increase production from the field may be limited.


 


    Lower oil and gas prices and other factors have resulted
    in ceiling test writedowns in the past and may in the future
    result in additional ceiling test writedowns or other
    impairments.  We capitalize the costs to
    acquire, find and develop our oil and gas properties under the
    full cost accounting method. The net capitalized costs of our
    oil and gas properties may not exceed the present value of
    estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves. If net
    capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceed this
    limit, we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings. This
    is called a “ceiling test writedown.” As of
    December 31, 2008, we recorded a $1.8 billion
    ($1.1 billion after-tax) ceiling test writedown. We
    recorded an additional $1.3 billion ($854 million
    after-tax) ceiling test writedown as of March 31, 2009.
    Although a ceiling test writedown does not impact cash flow from
    operations, it does reduce our stockholders’ equity. Once
    recorded, a ceiling test writedown is not reversible at a later
    date even if oil and gas prices increase.


 


    The risk that we will be required to further write down the
    carrying value of our oil and gas properties increases when oil
    and gas prices are low or volatile. In addition, writedowns may
    occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our
    estimated proved reserves or our unproved property values, or if
    estimated future development costs increase. We may experience
    further ceiling test writedowns or other impairments in the
    future. In addition, any future ceiling test cushion would be
    subject to fluctuation as a result of acquisition or divestiture
    activity.


 


    Drilling is a high-risk activity.  In
    addition to the numerous operating risks described in more
    detail below, the drilling of wells involves the risk that no
    commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be
    encountered. In addition, we often are uncertain as to the
    future cost or timing of drilling, completing and producing
    wells. Furthermore, our drilling operations may be curtailed,
    delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors,
    including:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    costs of, or shortages or delays in the availability of,
    drilling rigs, equipment and materials;




 



     
        • 

    
    adverse weather conditions and changes in weather patterns;




 



     
        • 

    
    unexpected drilling conditions;




 



     
        • 

    
    pressure or irregularities in formations;




 



     
        • 

    
    embedded oilfield drilling and service tools;




 



     
        • 

    
    equipment failures or accidents;




 



     
        • 

    
    lack of necessary services or qualified personnel;




 



     
        • 

    
    availability and timely issuance of required governmental
    permits and licenses;







    
    23



Table of Contents




 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    availability, costs and terms of contractual arrangements, such
    as leases, pipelines and related facilities to gather, process
    and compress, transport and market natural gas, crude oil and
    related commodities; and




 



     
        • 

    
    compliance with, or changes in, environmental, tax and other
    laws and regulations.





 


    The oil and gas business involves many operating risks
    that can cause substantial losses, and insurance may not protect
    us against all of these risks.  We are not
    insured against all risks. Our oil and gas exploration and
    production activities are subject to all of the operating risks
    associated with drilling for and producing oil and gas,
    including the risk of:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    fires and explosions;




 



     
        • 

    
    blow-outs;




 



     
        • 

    
    uncontrollable or unknown flows of oil, gas, formation water or
    drilling fluids;




 



     
        • 

    
    adverse weather conditions or natural disasters;




 



     
        • 

    
    pipe or cement failures and casing collapses;




 



     
        • 

    
    pipeline ruptures;




 



     
        • 

    
    discharges of toxic gases;




 



     
        • 

    
    build up of naturally occurring radioactive materials; and




 



     
        • 

    
    vandalism.





 


    If any of these events occur, we could incur substantial losses
    as a result of:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    injury or loss of life;




 



     
        • 

    
    severe damage or destruction of property and equipment, and oil
    and gas reservoirs;




 



     
        • 

    
    pollution and other environmental damage;




 



     
        • 

    
    investigatory and
    clean-up
    responsibilities;




 



     
        • 

    
    regulatory investigation and penalties;




 



     
        • 

    
    suspension of our operations; and




 



     
        • 

    
    repairs to resume operations.





 


    If we experience any of these problems, our ability to conduct
    operations could be adversely affected.


 


    Offshore and deepwater operations are subject to a variety of
    operating risks, such as capsizing, collisions and damage or
    loss from hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions. These
    conditions have in the past, and may in the future, cause
    substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production. Some
    of our offshore operations, and most of our deepwater and
    international operations, are dependent upon the availability,
    proximity and capacity of pipelines, natural gas gathering
    systems and processing facilities that we do not own. Necessary
    infrastructures have been in the past, and may be in the future,
    temporarily unavailable due to adverse weather conditions or
    other reasons or may not be available to us in the future at all
    or on acceptable terms.


 


    We maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these
    potential risks and losses. We may elect not to obtain insurance
    if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive
    relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and
    environmental risks generally are not insurable.


 


    Exploration in deepwater involves significant financial
    risks, and we may be unable to obtain the drilling rigs or
    support services necessary for our deepwater drilling and
    development programs in a timely manner or at acceptable
    rates.  Much of the deepwater play lacks the
    physical and oilfield service infrastructure necessary for
    production. As a result, development of a deepwater discovery
    may be a lengthy





    
    24



Table of Contents





    process and requires substantial capital investment, and it is
    difficult to estimate the timing of our production. Because of
    the size of significant projects in which we invest, we may not
    serve as the operator. As a result, we may have limited ability
    to exercise influence over operations related to these projects
    or their associated costs. Our dependence on the operator and
    other working interest owners for these deepwater projects and
    our limited ability to influence operations and associated costs
    could prevent the realization of our targeted returns on capital
    or lead to unexpected future losses.


 


    We are subject to complex laws that can affect the cost,
    manner or feasibility of doing business. In addition, potential
    regulatory actions could increase our costs and reduce our
    liquidity, delay our operations or otherwise alter the way we
    conduct our business.  Exploration and
    development and the production and sale of oil and gas are
    subject to extensive federal, state, local and international
    regulation. We may be required to make large expenditures to
    comply with environmental and other governmental regulations.
    Matters subject to regulation include:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    the amounts and types of substances and materials that may be
    released into the environment;




 



     
        • 

    
    response to unexpected releases to the environment;




 



     
        • 

    
    reports and permits concerning exploration, drilling, production
    and other operations;




 



     
        • 

    
    the spacing of wells;




 



     
        • 

    
    unitization and pooling of properties;




 



     
        • 

    
    calculating royalties on oil and gas produced under federal and
    state leases; and




 



     
        • 

    
    taxation.





 


    Under these laws, we could be liable for personal injuries,
    property damage, oil spills, discharge of hazardous materials,
    remediation and
    clean-up
    costs, natural resource damages and other environmental damages.
    We also could be required to install expensive pollution control
    measures or limit or cease activities on lands located within
    wilderness, wetlands or other environmentally or politically
    sensitive areas. Failure to comply with these laws also may
    result in the suspension or termination of our operations and
    subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties as
    well as the imposition of corrective action orders. Any such
    liabilities, penalties, suspensions, terminations or regulatory
    changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial
    condition, results of operations or cash flows.


 


    In addition, changes to existing regulations or the adoption of
    new regulations may unfavorably impact us, our suppliers or our
    customers. For example, governments around the world have become
    increasingly focused on climate change matters. In the United
    States, legislation that directly impacts our industry has been
    proposed covering areas such as emission reporting and
    reductions, hydraulic fracturing, the repeal of certain oil and
    gas tax incentives and tax deductions, and the regulation of
    over-the-counter
    commodity hedging activities. These and other potential
    regulations could increase our costs, reduce our liquidity,
    delay our operations or otherwise alter the way we conduct our
    business, negatively impacting our financial condition, results
    of operations and cash flows.


 


    Congress has been actively considering legislation to reduce
    emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the development
    of greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. In June of 2009, the
    U.S. House of Representatives passed a cap and trade bill
    known as the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009,
    which is now being considered by the U.S. Senate. In
    addition, more than one-third of the states already have begun
    implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse
    gases. Further, on April 2, 2007, the United States Supreme
    Court in Massachusetts, et al. v. EPA, held that carbon
    dioxide may be regulated as an “air pollutant” under
    the federal Clean Air Act. On April 24, 2009, EPA responded
    to the Massachusetts, et al. v. EPA decision with a
    proposed finding that the current and projected concentrations
    of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threaten the public health
    and welfare of current and future generations, and that certain
    greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles and motor vehicle
    engines contribute to the atmospheric concentrations of
    greenhouse gases and hence to the threat of climate change. EPA
    published the final version of this finding on December 15,
    2009, which allowed EPA to proceed with the rulemaking process
    to regulate





    
    25



Table of Contents





    greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. In anticipation of the
    finalization of EPA’s finding that greenhouse gases
    threaten public health and welfare, and that greenhouse gases
    from new motor vehicles contribute to climate change, EPA
    proposed a rule in September of 2009 that would require a
    reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles
    and would trigger applicability of Clean Air Act permitting
    requirements for certain stationary sources of greenhouse gas
    emissions. In response to this issue, EPA also proposed a
    tailoring rule that would, in general, only impose greenhouse
    gas permitting requirements on facilities that emit more than
    25,000 tons per year of greenhouse gases. Moreover, on
    September 22, 2009, EPA finalized a rule requiring
    nation-wide reporting of greenhouse gas emissions in 2011 for
    emissions occurring in 2010. The rule applies primarily to large
    facilities emitting 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon
    dioxide-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions per year, and to
    most upstream suppliers of fossil fuels and industrial
    greenhouse gas, as well as to manufacturers of vehicles and
    engines. Although it is not possible at this time to predict
    whether proposed legislation or regulations will be adopted as
    initially written, if at all, or how legislation or new
    regulation that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas
    emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and
    regulations could result in increased compliance costs or
    additional operating restrictions. Any additional costs or
    operating restrictions associated with legislation or
    regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions could have a
    material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows,
    in addition to the demand for the natural gas and other
    hydrocarbon products that we produce.


 


    The marketability of our production is dependent upon
    transportation and processing facilities over which we may have
    no control.  The marketability of our
    production depends in part upon the availability, proximity and
    capacity of pipelines, natural gas gathering systems and
    processing facilities. We deliver oil and gas through gathering
    systems and pipelines that we do not own. The lack of
    availability of capacity on these systems and facilities could
    reduce the price offered for our production or result in the
    shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of
    development plans for properties. Although we have some
    contractual control over the transportation of our production
    through some firm transportation arrangements, third-party
    systems and facilities may be temporarily unavailable due to
    market conditions or mechanical or other reasons, or may not be
    available to us in the future at a price that is acceptable to
    us. Any significant change in market factors or other conditions
    affecting these infrastructure systems and facilities, as well
    as any delays in constructing new infrastructure systems and
    facilities, could harm our business and, in turn, our financial
    condition, results of operations and cash flows.


 


    We have risks associated with our
    non-U.S. operations.  Ownership
    of property interests and production operations in areas outside
    the United States is subject to the various risks inherent in
    international operations. These risks may include:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations;




 



     
        • 

    
    loss of revenue, property and equipment as a result of
    expropriation, nationalization, war or insurrection;




 



     
        • 

    
    increases in taxes and governmental royalties;




 



     
        • 

    
    forced renegotiation of, or unilateral changes to, or
    termination of contracts with governmental entities and
    quasi-governmental agencies;




 



     
        • 

    
    changes in laws and policies governing operations of
    non-U.S. based
    companies;




 



     
        • 

    
    our limited ability to influence or control the operation or
    future development of these non-operated properties;




 



     
        • 

    
    the operator’s expertise or other labor problems;




 



     
        • 

    
    difficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental entity
    because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign
    sovereignty over international operations; and




 



     
        • 

    
    other uncertainties arising out of foreign government
    sovereignty over our international operations.





 


    Our international operations also may be adversely affected by
    the laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign
    trade, taxation and investment. In addition, if a dispute arises
    with respect to our international

    operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of
    non-U.S. courts
    or may not be successful in subjecting
    non-U.S. persons
    to the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States.


 


    We may be subject to risks in connection with
    acquisitions.  The successful acquisition of
    producing properties requires an assessment of several factors,
    including:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    recoverable reserves;




 



     
        • 

    
    future oil and gas prices and their appropriate differentials;




 



     
        • 

    
    operating costs; and




 



     
        • 

    
    potential environmental and other liabilities.





 


    The accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain. In
    connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the
    subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent
    with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing
    or potential problems nor will it permit us to become
    sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their
    deficiencies and capabilities. Inspections will not likely be
    performed on every well or facility, and structural and
    environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when
    an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified,
    the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective
    contractual protection against all or part of the problems.


 


    Competition for experienced technical personnel may
    negatively impact our operations or financial
    results.  Our continued drilling success and
    the success of other activities integral to our operations will
    depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain
    experienced explorationists, engineers and other professionals.
    Despite the recent decline in commodity prices and lower
    industry activity levels, competition for these professionals
    remains strong. We are likely to continue to experience
    increased costs to attract and retain these professionals.


 


    There is competition for available oil and gas
    properties.  Our competitors include major oil
    and gas companies, independent oil and gas companies and
    financial buyers. Some of our competitors may have greater and
    more diverse resources than we do. High commodity prices and
    stiff competition for acquisitions have in the past, and may in
    the future, significantly increase the cost of available
    properties.


 


    Our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, some of our
    arrangements with employees and Delaware law contain provisions
    that could discourage an acquisition or change of control of our
    company.   Our certificate of incorporation
    and bylaws contain provisions that may make it more difficult to
    effect a change of control of our company, to acquire us or to
    replace incumbent management. In addition, our change of control
    severance plan and agreements, our omnibus stock plans and our
    incentive compensation plan contain provisions that provide for
    severance payments and accelerated vesting of benefits,
    including accelerated vesting of restricted stock, restricted
    stock units and stock options, upon a change of control.
    Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law also
    imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations
    between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding
    common stock. These provisions could discourage or prevent a
    change of control or reduce the price our stockholders receive
    in an acquisition of our company.
