  ITEM 1.    BUSINESS        

<A
NAME="da19101_overview"> 
    Overview        

        We are a global power company. We own a portfolio of electricity generation and distribution businesses on five continents in 29
countries, with generation capacity totaling approximately 43,000 Megawatts ("MW") and distribution networks serving over 11 million people as of December 31, 2008. In addition, we have
more than 3,000 MW under construction in ten countries. Our global workforce of 25,000 people provides electricity to people in diverse markets ranging from urban centers in the United States
to remote villages in India. We were incorporated in Delaware in 1981 and for almost three decades we have been committed to providing safe and reliable energy. 


        We
own and operate two primary types of businesses. The first is our Generation business, where we own and/or operate power plants to generate and sell power to wholesale customers such
as utilities and other intermediaries. The second is our Utilities business, where we own and/or operate utilities to distribute, transmit and sell electricity to end-user customers in the
residential, commercial, industrial and governmental sectors in a defined service area. 

        Our
assets are diverse with respect to fuel source and type of market, which helps reduce certain types of operating risk. Our portfolio employs a broad range of fuels, including coal,
gas, fuel oil, biomass and renewable sources such as hydroelectric power, wind and solar, which reduces the risks associated with dependence on any one fuel source. Our presence in mature markets
helps reduce the volatility associated with our businesses in faster-growing emerging markets. In addition, our Generation portfolio is largely contracted, which reduces the risk related to the market
prices of electricity and fuel. We also attempt to limit risk by hedging much of our currency and commodity risk, and by matching the currency of most of our subsidiary debt to the revenue of the
business that issued that debt. However, our business is still subject to these and other risks, which are further disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10-K. 

        Our
goal is to maximize value for our shareholders through continued focus on increasing the profitability of our existing portfolio and increasing free cash flow while managing our risk
and employing rigorous capital allocation. We will continue to seek prudent expansion of our traditional Generation and Utilities lines of business, along with new investments in wind, solar, climate
solutions and energy storage. Portfolio management has become an increased area of focus through which we have sold and will continue to sell or monetize a portion of certain businesses or assets when
market values appear attractive. Furthermore, we will continue to focus on improving our business operations and management processes, including our internal controls over financial reporting. 

 Key Lines of Business  

        AES's primary sources of revenue and gross margin today are from Generation and Utilities. These businesses are distinguished by the
nature of the customers, operational differences, cost structure, regulatory environment and risk exposure. The breakout of revenue and gross margin

Generation and Utilities for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively is shown below. 

 Revenue

 Gross Margin

(1)Utilities
gross margin includes the margin from generation businesses owned by the Company and from whom the utility purchases energy. 

 Generation  

        We currently own or operate a portfolio of approximately 38,000 MW, consisting of 93 Generation facilities in 26 countries on
five continents at our generation businesses. We also have approximately 2,900 MW of capacity currently under construction in six countries. We are a major power source in

<A
HREF="#bg19101a_main_toc">Table of Contents



many
countries, such as Panama where we are the largest generator of electricity, and Chile, where AES Gener ("Gener") is the second largest electricity generation company in terms of capacity. Our
Generation business uses a wide range of technologies and fuel types including coal, combined-cycle gas turbines, hydroelectric power and biomass. Generation revenues were $8.3 billion,
$6.6 billion and $5.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 


        Performance
drivers for our Generation businesses include, among other factors, plant reliability, fuel costs and fixed-cost management. Growth in the Generation business is
largely tied to securing new power purchase agreements ("PPAs"), expanding capacity in our existing facilities and building new power plants. 

        The
majority of the electricity produced by our Generation businesses is sold under long-term contracts, or PPAs, to wholesale customers. In 2008, approximately 61% of the
revenues from our Generation business was from plants that operate under PPAs of five years or longer for 75% or more of their output capacity. These businesses often reduce their exposure to fuel
supply risks by entering into long-term fuel supply contracts or fuel tolling contracts where the customer assumes full responsibility for purchasing and supplying the fuel to the power
plant. These long-term contractual agreements result in relatively predictable cash flow and earnings and reduce exposure to volatility in the market price for electricity and fuel;
however, the amount of earnings and cash flow predictability varies from business to business based on the degree to which its exposure is limited by the contracts it has negotiated. 

        Our
Generation businesses with long-term contracts face most of their competition from other utilities and independent power producers ("IPPs") prior to the execution of a
power sales agreement during the development phase of a project or upon expiration of an existing agreement. Once a project is operational, we traditionally have faced limited competition due to the
long-term nature of the generation contracts. However, as our existing contracts expire, the introduction of new competitive power markets has increased competition to attract new
customers and maintain our current customer base. 

        The
balance of our Generation business sells power through competitive markets under short-term contracts or directly in the spot market. As a result, the cash flows and
earnings associated with these businesses are more sensitive to fluctuations in the market price for electricity, natural gas, coal and other fuels. However, for a number of these facilities,
including our plants in New York, which include a fleet of coal fired plants, we have hedged the majority of our exposure to fuel, energy and emissions pricing for 2009. Competitive factors for these
facilities include price, reliability, operational cost and third party credit requirements. 

 Utilities  

        AES utility businesses distribute power to over 11 million people in seven countries on five continents and consists primarily
of 14 companies owned or operated under management agreements, each of which operate in defined service areas. These businesses also include 15 generation plants in two countries totaling
approximately 4,400 MW. In addition, we have one generation plant under construction totaling 86 MW. These businesses have a variety of structures ranging from pure distribution
businesses to fully integrated utilities, which generate, transmit and distribute power. Indianapolis Power & Light ("IPL"), has the exclusive right to provide retail services to
approximately 470,000 customers in Indianapolis, Indiana. Eletropaulo Metropolitana Electricidad de
São Paulo S.A ("AES Eletropaulo" or "Eletropaulo"), serving the São Paulo metropolitan region for over 100 years, has approximately six million customers and is
the largest electricity distribution company in Brazil in terms of revenues and electricity distributed. In Cameroon, we are the primary generator and distributor of electricity and in El Salvador we
provide distribution services to serve more than 80% of the country's electricity customers. Utilities revenues were $7.8 billion, $6.9 billion and $6.2 billion for the years
ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

HREF="#bg19101a_main_toc">Table of Contents

        Performance
drivers for Utilities include, but are not limited to, reliability of service; management of working capital; negotiation of tariff adjustments; compliance with extensive
regulatory requirements; and in developing countries, reduction of commercial and technical losses. The results of operations of our Utilities businesses are sensitive to changes in economic growth
and regulation and abnormal weather conditions in the area in which they operate. 

        Utilities
face relatively little direct competition due to significant barriers to entry which are present in these markets. Where we do face competition is in our efforts to acquire
existing businesses and develop new ones. In this arena, we compete against a number of other market participants, some of which have greater financial resources, have been engaged in distribution
related businesses for longer periods of time and/or have accumulated more significant portfolios. Relevant competitive factors for our power distribution businesses include financial resources,
governmental assistance, regulatory restrictions and access to non-recourse financing. In certain locations, our distribution businesses face increased competition as a result of changes
in laws and regulations which allow wholesale and retail services to be provided on a competitive basis. 

 Wind, Solar and Other Initiatives  

        In recent years, as demand for renewable sources of energy has grown, we have placed increasing emphasis on developing projects in
wind, solar and the creation of greenhouse gas emission offset credits ("GHG credits"). We have also developed projects and/or made investments in climate solutions and energy storage. In 2005, we
started a wind generation business ("AES Wind Generation"), which currently has 16 plants in operation in three countries totaling over 1,200 MW and is one of the largest producers of wind
power in the U.S. In addition, over 400 MW are under construction in four countries outside the U.S. In March 2008, we formed AES Solar Energy LLC ("AES Solar"), a joint venture with
Riverstone Holdings, LLC ("Riverstone"), a private equity firm, which has since commenced commercial operations of 8 plants totaling 24 MW of solar projects in Spain and has development
potential in three other countries. In the area of climate solutions, we are developing and implementing projects to produce GHG credits and are currently developing projects in Asia, Europe and Latin
America. In the U.S., we formed Greenhouse Gas Services, LLC as a joint
venture with GE Energy Financial Services to create high quality verifiable emissions offsets for the voluntary U.S. market. We also formed a line of business to develop and implement utility scale
energy storage systems (such as batteries), which store and release power when needed. While none of these initiatives are currently material to our operations, we believe that in the future, they may
become a material contributor to our revenue and gross margin. However, there are risks associated with these initiatives, which are further disclosed in Item 1A—Risk Factors of
this Form 10-K. As further described in "Our Organization and Segments" below, some of these projects will be managed within the region where they are located, while others are
managed as business units. 

 Risks  

        We routinely encounter and address risks, some of which may cause our future results to be different, sometimes materially different,
than we presently anticipate. The categories of risk we have identified in Item 1A—Risk Factors of this Form 10-K include the
following: 



•Risks associated with our operations in areas with extensive current and future governmental and environmental regulation;  
•Risks associated with our exposure to material litigation and regulatory proceedings;   
•Risks associated with our disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting;   
•Risks associated with our high levels of debt;   
•Risks associated with the operation of power plants;

<A
HREF="#bg19101a_main_toc">Table of Contents





•Risks associated with revenue and earnings volatility; and   
•Risks associated with our ability to raise needed capital. 


        The
categories of risk identified above are discussed and explained in greater detail in Item 1A—Risk Factors of this Form 10-K. These risk factors
should be read in conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A"), and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included
elsewhere in this report.

NAME="da19101_our_organization_and_segments"> 
 
  Our Organization and Segments        

        We believe our broad geographic footprint allows us to focus development in targeted markets with opportunities for new investment, and
provides stability through our presence in more developed regions. In addition, our presence in each region affords us important relationships and helps us identify local markets with attractive
opportunities for new investment. As a result, we have structured our organization into geographic regions, and each region is led by a regional president responsible for managing existing businesses.
The regional presidents report to our Chief Operating Officer ("COO"), who in turn reports to our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"). Both our CEO and COO are based in Arlington, Virginia. 

        Through
the end of 2008, we organized our operations along our two primary lines of business (Generation and Utilities) within four geographic regions: Latin America; North America;
Europe & Africa; and Asia & the Middle East ("Asia"). Three regions, North America, Latin America and Europe & Africa, engaged in both Generation and Utility businesses. Our Asia
region only had Generation. Accordingly, these businesses and regions accounted for seven segments: 



•Latin America Generation;   
•Latin America Utilities;   
•North America Generation;   
•North America Utilities;   
•Europe & Africa Generation;   
•Europe & Africa Utilities; and   
•Asia Generation. 


        In
2008, AES Wind Generation, climate solutions, and certain other initiatives were managed by our alternative energy group. The associated revenue, development costs and operational
costs were reported under "Corporate and Other" since the results were not material to the presentation of our operating segments. "Corporate and Other" also included corporate overhead costs which
are not directly associated with the operations of our seven primary operating segments; interest income and expense; other intercompany charges such as management fees and self-insurance
premiums which are fully eliminated in consolidation. 

        In
early 2009, the Company began to implement certain organizational changes in an effort to streamline the organization. The new structure will continue to be organized along our two
lines of business, but within three regions instead of four: (1) North America, (2) Latin America & Africa and (3) Europe, Middle East & Asia ("EMEA"). In addition,
we will no longer have a separate alternative energy group. Instead, AES Wind Generation will be managed as part of our North America region
while climate solutions projects will be managed in the region in which they are located. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the reorganization on the Company's externally reported
segments in accordance with SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information ("SFAS No. 131"). AES Solar
is accounted for using the equity method and will continue to be reflected in Corporate and Other in 2009.

         Latin America Utilities.    Each of our Utilities businesses in Latin America sells electricity under regulated tariff agreements and has
transmission
and distribution capabilities but none of them has generation capability. AES Eletropaulo, a consolidated subsidiary of which AES owns a 16% economic interest and which has served the
São Paulo, Brazil area for over 100 years, has approximately six million customers and is the largest electricity distribution company in Brazil in terms of revenues and
electricity distributed. Pursuant to its concession contract, AES Eletropaulo is entitled to distribute electricity in its service area until 2028. AES Eletropaulo's service territory consists of 24
municipalities in the greater São Paulo metropolitan area and adjacent regions that account for approximately 15% of Brazil's GDP and 44% of the population in the State of
São Paulo, Brazil. AES Sul ("Sul"), a wholly owned subsidiary, serves over one million customers. In El Salvador, our Utilities businesses provide electricity to over 80% of the
country, serving approximately one million customers.

         North America Generation.    Approximately 60% of the generation capacity sold to third parties is supported by long-term power purchase
or
tolling agreements. Our North America Generation businesses consist of seven gas-fired, ten coal-fired and three petroleum coke-fired plants in the United States,
Puerto Rico and Mexico. 

        Four
of our coal-fired plants, Cayuga, Greenridge, Somerset and Westover, representing capacity of 1,268 MW, operate together as one business, AES Eastern Energy. This
business provides power to the Western New York power market under short-term contracts, as well as in the spot electricity market. We also operate three gas-fired plants, representing
capacity of 4,327 MW, in the Los Angeles basin under a long-term tolling agreement. These plants are also operated as one business, AES Southland.

         North America Utilities.    AES has one integrated utility in North America, IPL, which it owns through IPALCO Enterprises Inc.
("IPALCO"), the
parent holding company of IPL. IPL generates, transmits, distributes and sells electricity to approximately 470,000 customers in the city of Indianapolis and neighboring areas within the state of
Indiana. IPL owns and operates four generation facilities that provide essentially all of the electricity it distributes. The two largest generation facilities are primarily coal-fired
plants. The third facility has a combination of units that use coal (base load capacity) and natural gas and/or oil (peaking capacity). The fourth facility is a small peaking station that uses
gas-fired combustion turbine technology. IPL's gross generation capability is 3,492 MW. More than half of IPL's coal is provided by one supplier with which
IPL has long-term contracts. A key driver for the business is tariff recovery for environmental projects through the rate adjustment process. IPL's customers include
residential, industrial, commercial and all other which made up 36%, 40%, 16% and 8%, respectively, of North America Utilities revenue for 2008.

         Europe & Africa Generation.    In 2006, we began commercial operation of AES Cartagena ("Cartagena"), our first power plant in
Spain, with 1,199
MW capacity. The results of operations for Cartagena, an
unconsolidated entity, are included in the Equity in Earnings of Affiliates line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and therefore not reflected in these segment operating results.
Today, AES operates five power plants in Kazakhstan which account for almost 30% of the country's total installed generation capacity. In 2008, we completed the sale of a generation plant and a coal
mine in Kazakhstan, which we continue to operate under a management agreement through 2010. Key business drivers of this segment are: foreign currency exchange rates, new legislation and regulations
including those related to the environment.

         Asia Generation.    Almost half of our generation capacity in Asia is located in China. In 1996, AES joined with Chinese partners to build
Yangcheng,
the first "coal-by-wire" power plant with the capacity of 2,100 MW. In 2003, AES started commercial operations of its combined power and desalination water facility in
Oman, the first of its kind. We also have a combined power and desalination water facility, the first such facility to be awarded to the private sector, in Qatar. This facility generates over 18% of
the country's peak system capacity and 23% of the country's water supply. In April 2008, the Company completed the purchase of a 92% interest in a 660 MW coal-fired thermal power
generation facility in Masinloc, Philippines ("Masinloc"). AES Amman East ("Amman East") is a 380 MW combined-cycle gas power plant under construction in Jordan. Amman East achieved simple
cycle commercial operation in 2008 and is expected to achieve combined cycle operation in 2009.

 Corporate and Other  

        Corporate and Other includes general and administrative expenses related to corporate staff functions and
initiatives—primarily executive management, finance, legal, human resources, information systems and certain development costs which are not allocable to our business segments; interest
income and interest expense; and intercompany charges such as management fees and self insurance premiums which are fully eliminated in consolidation. 

        In
addition, Corporate and Other also includes the net operating results of AES Wind Generation, AES Solar, climate solutions, and certain other initiatives, which are not material to
our presentation of reporting segments. See Note 15—Segment and Geographic Information in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K
for information on revenue from external customers, gross margin and total assets by segment. 

        In
March 2008, we formed a joint venture called AES Solar LLC with Riverstone, a private equity firm to develop, own and operate solar installations. The joint venture is an
unconsolidated entity and accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Since its launch, AES Solar has commenced commercial operations of 24 MW of solar projects in Spain and has
development potential in three other countries. 

        We
own and operate 1,060 MW of wind generation capacity and operate an additional 215 MW capacity through operating and management agreements. Our wind business is located
primarily in North America where we operate wind generation facilities that have generation capacity of 1,174 MW. Buffalo Gap III, a 170 MW capacity wind farm commenced commercial
operations in August 2008.

  Regulatory Matters        

 Overview  

        In each country where we conduct business, we are subject to extensive and complex governmental regulations which affect most aspects
of our business, such as regulations governing the generation and distribution of electricity and environmental regulations. These regulations affect the operation, development, growth and ownership
of our businesses. Regulations differ on a country by country basis and are based upon the type of business we operate in a particular country. 

 Regulation of our Generation Businesses  

        Our Generation businesses operate in two different types of regulatory environments: 

         Market Environments.    In market environments, sales of electricity may be made directly on the spot market, under negotiated bilateral
contracts, or
pursuant to PPAs. The spot markets are typically administered by a central dispatch or system operator who seeks to optimize the use of the generation resources throughout an interconnected system
(cost of the least expensive next generation plant required to meet system demand). The spot price is usually set at the marginal cost of energy or based on bid prices. In addition, many of these
wholesale markets include markets for ancillary services to support the reliable operation of the transmission system, such as regulation (a service that corrects for short-term changes in
electricity use that could impact the stability of the power system). Most of our businesses in Europe, Latin America and the U.S. operate in these types of liberalized markets. 

         Other Environments.    We operate Generation assets in certain countries that do not have a spot market. In these environments,
electricity is sold only
through PPAs with state-owned entities and/or industrial clients as the offtaker. Examples of countries where we operate in this type of environment include Jordan, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Puerto
Rico, Qatar and Sri Lanka. 

 Regulation of our Distribution Businesses  

        In general, our distribution companies sell electricity directly to end users, such as homes and businesses and bill customers
directly. The amount our distribution companies can charge customers for electricity is governed by a regulated tariff. The tariff, in turn, is generally based upon a certain usage 

22




 

<A
HREF="#bg19101a_main_toc">Table of Contents



level
that includes a pass through of costs to the customer that are not controlled by the distribution company, including the costs of fuel (in the case of integrated utilities) and/or the costs of
purchased energy, plus a margin for the value added by the distributor, usually calculated as a fair return on the fair value of the company's assets. This regulated tariff is periodically reviewed
and reset by the regulatory agency of the government. Components of the tariff that are directly passed through to the customer are usually adjusted through an automated process. In many instances,
the tariffs can be adjusted between scheduled regulatory resets pursuant to an inflation adjustment or another index. Customers with demand above a certain level are often unregulated and can choose
to contract with generation companies directly and pay a wheeling fee, which is a fee to the distribution company for use of the distribution system. Most of our utilities operate as monopolies within
exclusive geographic areas set by the regulatory agency and face very limited competition from other distributors. 

        Set
forth below is a discussion of certain regulations we face in each country where we do business. In each country, the regulatory environment can pose material risks to our business,
its operations and/or its financial condition. For further discussion of those risks, see the Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

 Latin America  

         Brazil.    Brazil has one main interconnected electricity system, the National Interconnected System. The power industry in Brazil is
regulated by the
Brazilian government, acting through the Ministry of Mines and Energy and the National Electric Energy Agency, ("ANEEL"), an independent federal regulatory agency that has authority
over the Brazilian power industry. ANEEL supervises concessions for electricity generation, transmission, trading and distribution, including the setting of tariff rates, and supervising and auditing
of concessionaires. 

        On
March 15, 2004, the Brazilian government launched a proposed new model for the Brazilian power sector. The New Power Sector Model created two energy markets: (1) the
regulated contractual market for the distribution companies, and (2) the free contract environment market, designed for traders and other large volume users. 

        AES
has two distribution businesses in Brazil—Eletropaulo, serving approximately six million customers in the São Paulo area, and Sul, serving over one million
customers in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. Under the New Power Sector Model, every distribution utility is obligated to contract to meet 100% of its energy requirements in the regulated contractual
market, through energy auctions from new proposed generation projects or existing generation facilities. Bilateral contracts are being honored, but cannot be renewed. 

        The
tariff charged by distribution companies to regulated customers is composed of a non-manageable cost component (Part A), which includes energy purchase costs and
charges related to the use of transmission and distribution systems and is directly passed through to customers, and a manageable cost component (Part B), which includes operation and
maintenance costs based on a reference company (a model distribution company defined by ANEEL), recovery of depreciated assets and a component for the value added by the distributor (calculated as net
asset base multiplied by pre-tax weighted average cost of capital). Part B is reset every three to five years depending on the specific concession. There is an annual tariff
adjustment to pass through Part A costs to customers and to adjust the Part B costs by inflation less an efficiency factor (X-Factor). Distribution companies are also
entitled to extraordinary tariff revisions, in the event of significant changes to their cost structure. 

        At
ANEEL's Public Meeting on July 1, 2008, Eletropaulo was granted an 8.01% average tariff increase effective July 4, 2008. In the 2007 tariff reset process, certain items
were determined to be provisional and this process is expected to be defined in the next tariff adjustment process (July, 2009). 


        On
May 16, 2002, ANEEL issued Order 288, a regulation that stipulated the retroactive denial to the choice of not participating in the "exposition relief mechanism", a tool that
allowed the selling of

energy
from Itaipu Generating Co. in the spot market. Due to its negative impact, Sul filed a lawsuit seeking to annul Order 288, and as soon as the case went to court, Sul was granted a
preliminary
injunction that ordered ANEEL to review the Brazilian Electric Energy Commercialization Chamber ("CEEE") calculations and liquidation, an injunction that was later suspended. If Sul obtains a
favorable final verdict, it will have a positive impact of about R$437.8 million (historic values referring to 2001 and 2002) or approximately $187.0 million, but if Sul's requests are
not granted, under Order 288 Sul will owe a net amount of approximately R$146.7 million or approximately $62.6 million at December 31, 2008. All amounts are reserved in Sul's
books, including the amount owed to CCEE in the event Sul loses the case. 

        AES
has two generation businesses in Brazil—Tietê, a 2,651 MW hydro-generation facility and AES "Uruguaiana", a 639 MW generation facility. Under
the New Power Sector Model and in order to optimize the generation of electricity through Brazil's nationwide system, generation plants are allocated a generating capacity referred to as "assured
energy" or the amount of energy representing the long-term average energy production of the plant defined by ANEEL. Together with the system operator, ANEEL establishes the amount of
assured energy to be sold by each plant. The system operator determines generation dispatch which takes into account nationwide electricity demand, hydrological conditions and system constraints. In
order to mitigate risks involved in hydroelectric generation, a mechanism is in place to transfer surplus energy from those who generated in excess of their assured energy to those who generated less
than their assured energy. The energy that is reallocated through this mechanism is priced pursuant to an energy optimization tariff, designed to optimize the use of generation available in the
system. 

        Tietê
is allowed to sell electric power within the two environments, maintaining the competitive nature of the generation. All the agreements, whether entered in the ACR
(Regulated Contracting Environment) or in the ACL (Free Contracting Environment), are registered in the CCEE and they serve as basis for the accounting posting and the settlement of the differences in
the short-term market. Generation companies must provide physical coverage from their own power generation for 100% of their sale contracts. The verification of physical coverage is
accomplished on a monthly basis, based on generation data and on sale company contracts of the last 12 months. The failure to provide physical coverage exposes the generating company to the
payment of penalties. 

        Beginning
in 2006, all Tietê's assured energy has been sold to Eletropaulo. The PPA entered into with Eletropaulo expires on December 31, 2015, and requires that
the price of energy sold be adjusted annually based on the Brazilian inflation ("IGPM") variation. In October 2003, Tietê and Eletropaulo executed an amendment to extend the PPA through
June 2028. However, this amendment was not approved by ANEEL. In response, Eletropaulo filed a suit against ANEEL and is currently awaiting the first-instance judgment. Based on the current rules
concerning the purchase and sale of energy through the auction process, and because such rules remain in effect until 2015, the selling price may significantly differ from the current price adjusted
under the terms of the existing PPA. If the PPA were terminated, Tietê would only be allowed to sell in the ACR or ACL. 

        Tietê's
concession agreement with the State of São Paulo for its generation plant includes an obligation to increase generation capacity by 15% originally
to be accomplished by the end of 2007. Tietê, as well as other concessionaire generators, were not able to meet this requirement due to regulatory, environmental and hydrological
constraints, and requested an extension of the term. Currently, the matter is under consideration by the Government of the State of São Paulo, after a decision by the Board of Officers
of ANEEL, that ANEEL is not the appropriate authority to consider the extension, since the expansion obligation derives from the purchase and sale agreement between Tietê and the
Government of São Paulo, and not from the concession agreement. Tietê is negotiating new conditions and a new deadline to fulfill the expansion requirement. There is a
dispute alleging that Tietê failed to increase its generation capacity as established in the concession agreement. The dispute seeks to determine the application of penalties related to
the concession agreement, and also to

determine
its termination. Judicial summons have been received and, in October 2008, Tietê presented its defense. On October 31, 2008, a decision was rendered ordering the
Plaintiff to respond to Tietê's defense. Such a response has not been filed yet. 

        Uruguaiana
has been impacted by the energy crisis in Argentina, primarily through natural gas supply restrictions. During this period, Uruguaiana has been forced to purchase energy from
the spot market and through bilateral contracts in order to satisfy its alleged obligations under the PPAs with the distribution companies. In August 2008, the Argentinean gas supplier sent a
notification to Uruguaiana declaring force majeure under the gas supply agreement. Uruguaiana extended the effects of such force majeure to the PPAs with the distribution companies. After such
declaration by the Argentinean gas supplier, Uruguaiana started negotiations with the four distribution companies to reduce the amount of energy contracted under the PPAs and resolve these matters.
From August 2008 to December 2008, Uruguaiana and the distribution companies entered into amendments to reduce the energy amounts under the PPAs to the level of the bilateral agreements executed by
Uruguaiana, suspend such agreements by December 2009 and settle all pending matters. Three of these distribution companies sought and received a decision by ANEEL declaring that they were entitled to
involuntary exposures, which allows these distribution companies to purchase replacement energy in the market and recover the related additional costs, if any, through their tariffs. The fourth
involuntary exposure request from a distribution company is under analysis by ANEEL. 

         Chile.    In Chile, except for the small isolated systems of Aysén and Punta Arenas, generation activities are principally in two
electric systems: the Central Interconnected Grid (known as the SIC), which supplies approximately 92% of the country's population; and the Northern Interconnected Grid (known as the SING), where the
principal users are mining and industrial companies. 

        In
each of these grids, electricity generation is coordinated by the respective independent Economic Load Dispatch Center, or CDEC, in order to minimize operational costs and ensure the
highest economic efficiency of the system, while fulfilling all quality of service and reliability requirements established by current regulations. In order to satisfy demand at the lowest possible
cost at all times, each CDEC orders the dispatch of generation plants based strictly on variable generation costs, starting
with the lowest variable cost, and does so independent of the contracts held by each generation company. Thus, while the generation companies are free to enter into supply contracts with their
customers and are obligated to comply with such contracts, the energy needed to satisfy demand is always produced by the CDEC members whose variable production costs are lower than the system's
marginal cost at the time of dispatch. In addition, the Chilean market is designed to include payments for capacity (or firm capacity), which are explicitly paid to generation companies for
contributing to the system's sufficiency. The cost of investment and operation of transmission systems are borne by generation companies and consumers (regulated tolls) in proportion to their use. 

        The
Chilean Ministry of Economy, Development and Reconstruction grants concessions for the provision of the public service of electric distribution; and the National Commission for the
Environment administers the system for evaluating the environmental impact of projects. Concessions are not required from government agencies to build and operate thermoelectric plants. The National
Energy Commission establishes, regulates and coordinates energy policy. The Superintendency of Electricity and Fuels oversees compliance with service quality and safety regulations. The General Water
Authority issues the rights to use water for hydroelectric generation plants. The Chilean electric system includes a Panel of Experts, an independent technical agency whose purpose is to analyze and
resolve in a timely fashion conflicts arising between companies within the electric sector and among one or more of these companies and the energy authorities. 


        Power
generation is based primarily on long-term contracts between generation companies and customers specifying the volume, price and conditions for the sale of energy and
capacity. The law recognizes two types of customers for generation companies: unregulated customers and regulated customers. Unregulated customers are principally consumers whose connected capacity is
higher than 

25




 

<A
HREF="#bg19101a_main_toc">Table of Contents



2 MW,
and consumers whose connected capacity is between 500 kW and 2 MW who have selected the unregulated pricing mechanism for a period of four years. These customers are not subject to price
regulation; therefore, generation and distribution companies are able to freely negotiate prices and conditions for electricity supply with them. Regulated customers are those whose connected capacity
is less than or equal to 500 KW, and those with connected capacity between 500 kW and 2 MW who have selected—also for four years—the regulated pricing system. 

        The
distinct electricity sector activities are regulated by the General Electricity Services Law, DFL No. 1/1982 enacted by the Mining Ministry, with its subsequent amendments:
Law No. 19,490 (2004, known as the "Short Law I") and Law No. 20,01/005, or the "Short Law II", which did not modify the foundation of Chile's stable electricity sector model. These laws
were rewritten and systematized under DFL No. 4/2007. Sector activities are also governed by the corresponding technical regulations and standards. 

        In
accordance with the amendment to the electricity law enacted in May 2005, new contracts assigned by distribution companies for consumption from 2010 onward must be awarded to
generation
companies based on the lowest supply price offered in public bid processes. These prices called "long-term node prices", include indexation formulas and are valid for the entire term of
the contract, up to a maximum of 15 years. More precisely, the long-term energy node price for a particular contract is the lowest energy price offered by the generation companies
participating in each respective bid process, while the long-term capacity node price is that set in the node price decree in effect at the time of the bid. 


        <FONT
SIZE=2>The "Tokman Law", which was enacted in September 2007, requires that generation companies must continue to supply electricity to
distribution companies whose supply contract may be terminated as a result of bankruptcy of the distribution company, its generation supplier, or the anticipated termination of the power purchase
contract due to an arbitration award or court decision. The law states that in these situations, if the distribution company is not able to procure a new contract, all generation companies in the
system must then supply the distribution company at node prices based on the generator's respective participation in the grid. 


        Another
statute, Law 20,257, was enacted in April 2008. Law 20, 257 promotes non-conventional renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, small hydroelectric and biomass
energy. The law requires that a percentage of the new power purchase contracts held by generation companies after August 31, 2007, be supplied from renewable sources. The required energy
percentage begins at 5% for the period 2010-2015, and gradually increases to a maximum of 10% in 2024. A penalty is applied for each kWh not supplied in accordance with the law. Our
businesses in Chile have developed a plan for complying with this law, which includes the sale of certain water rights, the purchasers of which have agreed to build a small hydroelectric plant and
sell the energy to Gener at a fixed price. 

        Colombia.    Colombia has one main national interconnected system (the "SIN"). In 1994 the Colombian Congress issued the laws of
Domiciliary Public
Services and the Electricity Law, which set the institutional arrangement and the general regulatory framework for the electricity sector. The Regulatory Commission of Electricity and Gas ("CREG") was
created to foster the efficient supply of energy through regulation of the wholesale market, the natural monopolies of transmission and distribution, and by setting limits for horizontal and vertical
economic integration. The control function was assigned to the Superintendency of Public Services. 


        The
wholesale market is organized around both bilateral contracts and a mandatory pool and spot market for all generation units larger than 20 MW. Each unit bids its availability
quantities for a 24 hour period with one bid price set for those 24 hours. The dispatch is arranged by lowest to highest bid price and the spot price is set by the marginal price. 

        The
spot market started in July 1995, and in 1996 a capacity payment was introduced for a term of 10 years. In December 2006, a regulation was enacted that replaced the capacity
charge with the 

26




 

<A
HREF="#bg19101a_main_toc">Table of Contents



reliability
charge and established two implementation periods. The first period consists of a transition period from December 2006 to November 2012, during which, the price is equal to $13.045 per MWh
("megawatt hour") and volume is determined based on firm energy offers which are pro-rated so that the total firm energy level does not exceed system demand. The second period, in which
the reliability charge will be determined, based on the energy price and volume offers submitted by new market participants bidding for new capacity for the system, begins in December 2012. The first
reliability charge auction was held in May 2008 with the following results: (i) The reliability charge for existing plants for the period between December 2012 and November 2013 will be $13.998
per MWh; (ii) For new plants that successfully participated in the auction, the charge will be paid for 20 years starting December 2012; (iii) Three new projects won the
auction for a total capacity of 429.6 MW starting in 2012. 

        Furthermore,
the CREG issued a proposal to create the "MOR" or Organized Regulated Market. The MOR will replace current bilateral contracts (assigned between traders and generators) for
a centralized auction in which the System Operator buys energy for all regulated customers attended by the traders. The main provisions contained in the proposal include: i) it is mandatory for
all traders to buy energy at the auction price and it is voluntary for sellers (generators and traders companies) to offer energy in each auction; ii) one price for the energy sales in the
year; iii) the auctions are held one year before the actual dispatch moment and the commitment period of the auction is one year, iv) the proposal is to establish four auctions in each
year, in order to cover the annual demand. We expect that a definitive resolution on this matter will be issued in the second quarter of 2009. 

        Finally,
ANDI—the Colombian Industry Guild, and the Energy Minister, among others, have raised objections to the increase in energy prices in the spot and bilateral contracts
market for 2009 and 2010. In response, the regulator (CREG) issued new rules that allow traders to slowly adjust the tariffs to consumers and to promote competition. In general, these rules are not
expected to create significant changes in the current regulation. 

         Argentina.    Argentina has one main national interconnected system. The National Electrical Regulating Agency is responsible for ensuring
the
compliance of transmission and distribution companies to concessions granted by the Argentine government, and approves distribution tariffs. The regulatory entity authorized to manage and operate the
wholesale electricity market in Argentina is Compañía Administradora del Mercado Mayorista Eléctrico, Sociedad Anómima, ("CAMMESA"), in
coordination with the policies established by the National Secretariat of Energy. 

        CAMMESA
performs load dispatching and clears commercial transactions for energy and power. Sales of electricity may be made on the spot market at the marginal cost of energy to satisfy
the system's
hourly demand, or in the wholesale energy market under negotiated term contracts. As a result of the gas crisis earlier this decade, this mechanism was modified in 2003 by Resolution 240/03. At
present, the price is determined as if all generating units in Argentina were operating with natural gas, even though they may be using other, more expensive, alternative fuels. In the case of
generators using alternative fuels, CAMMESA pays the total variable cost of production, which may exceed the established spot price. Additionally, in the spot market, generators are also remunerated
for their capacity to generate electricity in excess of supply agreements or private contracts executed by them. 

        As
the result of a political, social and economic crisis, the Argentine government has adopted many new economic measures since 2002, by means of the "Emergency Law" 25561 issued on
January 6, 2002, extended by Law N? 26.456 issued on December 16, 2008 until December 31, 2009. The regulations adopted in the energy sector effectively terminated the
use of the U.S. Dollar as the functional currency of the Argentine electricity sector. During 2004, the Energy Secretariat reached agreements with natural gas and electricity producers to reform the
energy markets. In the electricity sector, the Energy Secretariat passed Resolution 826/2004, inviting generators to contribute a percentage of their sales margins to fund the development and
construction of two new combined cycle power plants to be installed by 2008/2009. The time period for the funding was set from January 2004 

27

through
December 2006 and was subsequently extended through December 2007. During 2008 both power plants have started the operation of the gas turbines, and during the second half of 2009 it is
expected that the steam turbines will be installed and the plants will start to operate in combined cycle mode. In exchange, the Government committed to reform the market regulation to match the
pre-crisis rules prevailing before December 2001. Additionally, participating generators will receive a pro-rata ownership share in the new generation plants after ten years. 

        Under
the previous regulations, distribution companies were granted long-term concessions (up to 99 years) which provided, directly or indirectly, tariffs based upon
U.S. Dollars and adjusted by the U.S. consumer price index and producer price index. Under the new regulations, tariffs are no longer linked to the U.S. Dollar and U.S. inflation indices. As a
consequence of the emergency declared by the above-mentioned laws and its resulting regulatory framework, the tariffs of all distribution companies were converted to pesos and were frozen at the peso
national rate as of December 31, 2001. In October 2003, the Argentine Congress established a procedure for renegotiation of the public utilities concessions. 

        On
November 12, 2004, EDELAP, an AES distribution business, signed a Letter of Understanding with the Argentine government in order to renegotiate its concession contract and to
start a tariff reform process, which was ratified by the National Congress on May 11, 2005. Final government approval was obtained on July 14, 2005. As a first step during this process,
a Distribution Value Added ("DVA") increase of 28%, effective February 1, 2005, was granted. On October 24, 2005, EDEN and EDES, two AES distribution businesses, signed a Letter of
Understanding with the Ministry of Infrastructure and Public Services of the Province of Buenos Aires to renegotiate their concession contracts and to start a tariff reform process, which was formally
approved on November 30, 2005. An initial 19% DVA increase became effective in August 2005 and an additional 8% DVA increase became effective in January 2007.
On July 31, 2008, ENRE (the national electricity regulatory agency) issued Resolution 324 that granted EDELAP a tariff increase DVA of approximately 18%. In addition, the Government established
that a process to establish the RTI (integral tariff reset) will take place during February 2009. Upon execution of these Letters of Understanding, AES agreed to postpone or suspend certain
international claims. However, these Letters of Understanding provide that if the government does not fulfill its commitments, AES may restart the international claim process. AES has postponed any
action until the tariff reset is finalized. 

        On
August 25, 2008 the Province of Buenos Aires issued the Decree 1578, that granted EDES a tariff increase DVA of approximately 49%. This decree granted a rise in the tariff at
all levels of consumption. The Government also established that the tariff review process will take place during 2009. 

         El Salvador.    Electricity generators and distribution companies in El Salvador are linked through a single, main interconnected system
managed by the
Transactions Unit ("UT"). The transmission system is operated by ETESAL, a state-owned company. The El Salvador wholesale electricity market is comprised of: (1) a contract market based on
contracts between electricity generators, distributors and trading companies and (2) a spot market for uncontracted electricity based upon bids from spot market participants specifying prices
at which they are willing to buy or sell electricity. 

        El
Salvador has five electricity distribution companies, which came under private ownership as part of the privatization process that took place in 1998. AES controls four of these five
distribution companies, encompassing about 80% of the national territory, serving about 1,100,000 customers. El Salvador's electricity industry is regulated under the General Electricity Law enacted
in October 1996 and subsequently amended twice in June 2003, and in October 2007. The Superintendencia General de Electricidad y Telecomunicaciones ("SIGET") is an independent regulatory authority
that regulates the electricity and telecommunications sectors in El Salvador. 

28




 

<A
HREF="#bg19101a_main_toc">Table of Contents

        The
maximum tariff to be charged by distribution companies to regulated customers is subject to the approval of SIGET. The components of the electricity tariff are (a) the average
energy price ("energy charge"), (b) the charges for the use of the distribution network ("distribution charge"), and (c) customer service costs ("service charge"). Both the distribution
charge and service charge are based on average capital costs as well as operation and maintenance costs of an efficient distribution company. The energy charge is adjusted every six months to reflect
the changes in the spot market price for electricity. The distribution charge and service charge are approved by SIGET every five years and have two adjustments: (1) an annual adjustment
considering the inflation variation and (2) an
automatic adjustment in April, July and October, provided that change in the adjusted value exceeds the value in effect by at least 10%. 


        The
distribution tariff for all five distribution companies in El Salvador was reset on December 4, 2007. The approved tariff schedule is valid for the next five years
(2008-2012). One outcome of the tariff reset was a significant reduction in the distribution value added component of the tariff for each of AES's distribution businesses. On
March 28, 2008, after negotiations with SIGET and the El Salvador Presidential House, a revised tariff schedule was enacted. It came into force on April 1, 2008. The negotiated tariff
schedule included a higher technical losses index than originally recognized by SIGET. This permits the companies to recover an adequate portion of their technical losses through billing. The new
tariffs improved distribution revenues by around 9% compared to the rates set on December 4, 2007. This schedule is valid for the period 2008-2012. As a result of this negotiation
and the enactment of the new rate schedule, AES agreed to withdraw its appeal recourse before the El Salvador Supreme Court, which was introduced on December 11, 2007. 

        As
expected, SIGET approved new regulations for Service Connection and Reconnection charges, which came into force on November 3, 2008. The charges underwent a reduction of about
20% on average for these activities. In addition, there are also Quality of Service Regulations contained in SIGET resolution 192-E-2004, which require that distribution
companies comply with certain Technical Product Standards, Technical Service Standards and Commercial Service Standards. The Quality of Service Standards became permanent in 2008, which means that
they are now enforced to their full extent. 

        On
November 28, 2008 SIGET enacted the bylaw for the Operation of the Transmission System and the Wholesale Market based on Generation Costs, which provides rules for the
Independent System Operator, who is responsible for administering and operating the wholesale market for electricity. From 1996 until the passing of the bylaw, the wholesale market was governed by a
price-offer system, whereby each generator submitted a daily price offer for its available generation (limited by a price cap) and the offer price determined dispatch. Under the new bylaw, each
generating unit will have audited variable costs (generating costs), which will determine the economic dispatch merit order. The bylaw also provides for additional capacity payments to providers as
determined by the regulator. The variable costs mechanism enabling legislation has been enacted, and it provides for a preparation and transition period before the regulations are in full force and
effect which is scheduled to occur in 2010. 

        Currently,
the Company does not face any regulatory action in El Salvador. 

         Dominican Republic.    The Dominican Republic has one main interconnected system with 3,000 MW of installed capacity and four
isolated systems.
Under current regulations, the Dominican government retains ultimate oversight and regulatory authority as well as control and ownership of the transmission grid and the hydroelectric facilities in
the country. In addition, the government shares ownership in certain generation and distribution assets. The Dominican government's oversight responsibilities for
the electricity sector are carried out by the National Energy Commission ("CNE") and the Superintendency of Electricity. 

29

        The
wholesale market in the Dominican Republic commenced operations in June 2000. This market includes a spot market and contract market. All participants in the Dominican electric
system with available units are put in the spot market in order of merit for dispatch based on lowest marginal cost. The order of merit determines the order in which each participant is dispatched.
The order of merit is effective for one week. The price to be paid for the electricity corresponds to the marginal cost of the last dispatched unit using natural gas. Sector participants may execute
private contracts in which they agree to specific price, energy, and capacity transactions. 

        The
regulatory framework in the Dominican electricity market establishes a methodology for calculating the firm capacity, which is the supply that can be economically dispatched by a
generating unit during peak demand, provided that the unit has a certain unavailability (mechanical in the case of thermal power plants, and primarily hydrological in the case of hydroelectric power
plants). The total firm capacity of the electric system in a year is equal to the peak demand of that year. The capacity payment is regulated as the average fixed cost (monthly capital cost of the
investment cost plus fixed operational and maintenance cost) of an oil-fired open cycle gas turbine, multiplied by a factor to take into account a reserve margin. 

        The
financial crisis in the Dominican Republic during 2004 caused a financial crisis in the electricity sector. The inability to pass through higher fuel prices and the costs of
devaluation led to a gap between collections at the distribution companies and the amounts required to pay the generators. In 2005 the government committed itself to stay current with its energy bills
and also to cover the potential deficit of distribution companies. During 2005, 2006, and 2007 the government was paying both the subsidies and its own energy bills on time. In December 2006, a bill
with the primary goal of supporting fraud prosecution was sent to Congress by the Executive Branch. This bill was approved in July 2007 and is expected to help the sector reach financial
sustainability by: criminalizing electrical fraud; setting new limits to non-regulated users in order to protect the distribution companies' market; allowing for service cutoff after only
one bill due; and classifying as a national security breach the intentional damage or interruption of the national electricity grid. 

        Despite
these improvements, the electricity sector has not completely recovered from the financial crisis of 2004. In 2006 the electricity sector needed $530 million in subsidies
from the government to cover current operations. In 2007, the sector needed more than $630 million and, at projected fuel prices, (petroleum at $75 per barrel) the government budgeted subsidies
of $800 million for 2008. In 2008, because petroleum and all other fuels doubled in price, the subsidy of $800 million was not enough to cover additional costs, which reached
$1,200 million. The Government has been trying to raise more funds, by allocating funds from the national budget, such as a recent approval of an additional
$300 million in electricity subsidies supplementing 2008. In addition the Government has been trying to obtain credit from local banks and multilateral institutions. 

        In
October of 2006, CDEEE (Corporación Dominicana de Empresas Electricas Estatales), the state owned transmission and hydro company, began making public statements that it
intends to seek to compel the renegotiation and/or rescission of long-term PPAs with certain power generating companies in the Dominican Republic. Although the details concerning CDEEE's
statements are unclear and no formal government action has been taken, AES holds ownership interests in three power generation facilities in the country (AES Andres, Itabo and Dominican Power
Partners) that could be adversely affected by the actions taken by the CDEEE, if any. 

         Panama.    In 1998, as part of the privatization process, the Panamanian Government divided the Instituto de
Recursos
Hidráulicos y de Electrificación (IRHE's) assets and operations into four generation companies, three distribution companies and one transmission
company. Following a public auction, 51% of shares in each distribution company were sold by the Panamanian Government in September 1998. This was followed in November 1998 by the sale of 49% of
shares in each of the three state-owned hydroelectric generation companies and 51% of shares in the main thermoelectric generation

company.
These sales were completed in 1999. As a result of the sales, AES acquired control and operation of two of the hydroelectric companies. 


        The
Panamanian Government retained control of Empresa de Transmisión Eléctrica, S.A. (ETESA), the
state-owned transmission company, which operates and controls the National Interconnected System (NIS) of 230Kv and certain 115Kv lines. Panama has one main interconnected system (the NIS) operated by
ETESA. The transmission charges are reviewed and approved every four years by The National Authority of Public Services (ASEP); the current transmission tariffs are in effect until June 2009. The ASEP
sets the framework for the tariff regime, determining transmission zones and rates applicable in the relevant zones and regulates power generation, transmission, interconnection and distribution
activities in the electric power sector. 

        The
National Dispatch Center ("CND") is responsible for planning, supervising and controlling the integrated operation of the NIS and for ensuring its safe and reliable operation. The
dispatch order is determined and planned by the CND, which dispatches electricity from generation plants based on lowest marginal cost. According to the Electricity Law, the order in which generators
are dispatched must be based on maximizing efficient consumption of energy by minimizing the total cost of energy in the Panamanian power system. 

        Distribution
companies are required to contract 100% of their annual power requirements (although they can self-generate up to 15% of their demand). Generators can enter into
long-term PPAs with distributors or unregulated consumers. In addition, generators can enter into alternative supply contracts with each other. The terms and contents of PPAs are
determined through a competitive bidding process and are governed by the Commercial Rules. AES Panama participated in the last Public Bid of Long Term called EDEMET 01-08 for the supply of
power and energy until the year 2022. The public bid was held on September 9, 2008 and part of the Public Bid for the sale of 100MW at $92.95/MWh from the year 2012 until the year 2021 and
41 MW at $99.87/MWh from the year 2013 until the year 2022 was awarded to AES Panama. AES Panama already contracted to sell an average of 86% of firm capacity through 2018. 

        Under
the Electricity Law, generation companies will not be granted new concessions if they would thereby account, directly or indirectly, for more than 25% of national electricity
consumption. The percentage may be increased by the Panamanian Government where justified by competitive conditions subject to the approval of the ASEP. The percentage was increased to 40% by
Executive Resolution No. 76 of October 19, 2005. This provision does not apply to licenses for thermal generation. 

        Besides
the PPA market, generators may buy and sell energy in the spot market. Energy sold in the spot market corresponds to the hourly differences between the actual dispatch of energy
by each generator and its contractual commitments to supply energy. The energy spot price is set by the order in which generators are dispatched. The CND ranks generators according to their variable
cost (thermal) and the value of water (hydroelectric), starting with the lowest value, thereby establishing on an hourly basis the merit order in which generators will be dispatched the following day
in order to meet expected demand. This price ranking system is intended to ensure that national demand will be satisfied by the lowest cost combination of available generating units in the country. A
generator whose dispatched energy is greater than its contractual commitments to supply energy at any given time is a seller in the energy spot market; the reverse is true for a generator whose
dispatched energy is less than its contractual commitments to supply energy. Generators and unregulated consumers can purchase energy in the energy spot market, while only generators can sell energy
in the energy spot market.

 North America  

         United States.    The U.S. wholesale electricity market consists of multiple distinct regional markets that are subject to both federal
regulation, as
implemented by the FERC, and regional regulation as defined by rules designed and implemented by the Independent System Operator ("ISO"). These rules for the most part govern such items as the
determination of the market mechanism for setting the system marginal price for energy and the establishment of guidelines and incentives for the addition of new capacity. The current regulatory
framework in the U.S. is the result of a series of regulatory actions that have taken place over the past two decades, as well as numerous policies adopted by both the federal government and the
individual states that encourage competition in wholesale and retail electricity markets. 

        The
federal government, through regulations promulgated by FERC, has primary jurisdiction over wholesale electricity markets and transmission services. While there have been numerous
federal
statutes enacted during the past 30 years, including the Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act of 1978 ("PURPA"), the Energy Policy Act of 1992 ("EPAct 1992") and the Energy Policy Act of 2005
("EPAct 2005"), there are two fundamental regulatory initiatives implemented by FERC during that time frame that directly impact our U.S. businesses: 



(a)FERC approval of market based rate authority beginning in 1986 for many providers of wholesale generation;
and
(b)FERC issuance of Order #888 in 1996 mandating the functional separation of generation and transmission
operations and requiring utilities to provide open access to their transmission systems. 


        Several
of our generation businesses in the U.S. currently operate as Qualifying Facilities ("QF's") as defined under PURPA. These businesses entered into long-term contracts
with electric utilities that had a mandatory obligation at that time, as specified under PURPA, to purchase power from QF's at the utility's avoided cost (i.e. the likely costs for both energy
and facilities that would have been incurred by the purchasing utility if that utility had to provide its own generating capacity). EPAct 2005 later amended PURPA to eliminate the mandatory purchase
obligation in certain markets, but did so only on a prospective basis. Cogeneration facilities and small power production facilities that meet certain criteria can be QFs. To be a QF, a cogeneration
facility must produce electricity and useful thermal energy for an industrial or commercial process or heating or cooling applications in certain proportions to the facility's total energy output, and
must meet certain efficiency standards. To be a QF, a small power production facility must generally use a renewable resource as its energy input and meet certain size criteria. 

        Our
non-QF generation businesses in the U.S. currently operate as Exempt Wholesale Generators ("EWG's") as defined under EPAct 1992. These businesses were historically exempt
from PUHCA 1935 and are also exempt from the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 ("PUHCA 2005"), and subject to FERC approval, have the right to sell power at market-based rates, either
directly to the wholesale market or to a third party offtaker such as a power marketer or utility/industrial customer. As an example, one of our larger generation businesses in the U.S. is Eastern
Energy. A brief description of the regulatory environment under which Eastern Energy operates is provided below: 

         Eastern Energy.    AES, through its Eastern Energy subsidiary, currently operates four coal-fired generation plants with a combined total
capacity of 1,268 MW located in the state of New York. The plants sell power directly to the New York Independent System Operator ("NYISO"), a FERC approved regional operator which manages the
transmission system in New York and operates the state's wholesale electricity markets. NYISO is regulated as an electric utility by the FERC and has an Open Access Transmission Tariff on file that
incorporates rates and conditions for use of the 

32




 

<A
HREF="#bg19101a_main_toc">Table of Contents



transmission
system and a Market Services Tariff that describes the rules and conditions of use for the various markets. 

        The
NYISO wholesale power markets are based on a combination of bilateral contracts, contracts for differences ("CFDs") which financially settle relative to an agreed upon index or
floating price, and NYISO-administered day-ahead and real-time energy markets. The day-ahead market includes energy, regulation and operating reserves and is a
financially binding commitment to produce or replace the products sold. The real time market, which also offers energy, regulation and operating reserves, is a balancing market and is not a
financially binding commitment but rather a best effort standard. NYISO uses location based marginal pricing (i.e., pricing for energy at a given location based on a market clearing price that
takes into account physical limitations, generation and demand throughout the region) calculated at each node to account for congestion on the grid. Generators are paid the location marginal price at
their node, while the end customer pays a zonal price that is the average of nodes within a zone. The market has a $1,000 per MWh cap on bids for energy. However, market rules also incorporate
scarcity pricing mechanisms when the market is short of required operating reserves that can result in energy prices above $1,000 per MWh. 

        In
addition to our generation businesses, we also own IPL, a vertically integrated utility located in Indiana. A brief description of the regulatory environment under which IPL operates
is provided below: 

         IPL.    As a regulated electric utility, IPL is subject to regulation by the FERC and the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission ("IURC").
As indicated
below, the financial performance of IPL is directly impacted by the outcome of various regulatory proceedings before the IURC and FERC. 


        IPL
is subject to regulation by the IURC with respect to the following: its services and facilities; the valuation of property; the construction; purchase or lease of electric generating
facilities; the classification of accounts; rates of depreciation; retail rates and charges; the issuance of securities (other than evidences of indebtedness payable less than twelve months after the
date of issue); the acquisition and sale of some public utility properties or securities; and certain other matters. 

        IPL's
tariff rates for electric service to retail customers (basic rates and charges) are set and approved by the IURC after public hearings ("general rate case"). General
rate cases, which have occurred at irregular intervals, include the participation of consumer advocacy groups and certain customers. The last general rate case for IPL was completed in 1995. In
addition, pursuant to statute, the IURC is to conduct a periodic review of the basic rates and charges of all utilities at least once every four years, but the IURC has the authority to review the
rates of any utility in its jurisdiction at any time it chooses. Such reviews have not been subject to public hearings. 

        The
majority of IPL customers are served pursuant to retail tariffs that provide for the monthly billing or crediting to customers of increases or decreases, respectively, in the actual
costs of fuel (including purchased power costs) consumed from estimated fuel costs embedded in basic rates, subject to certain restrictions on the level of operating income. These billing or crediting
mechanisms are referred to as "trackers". This is significant because fuel and purchased power costs represent a large and volatile portion of IPL's total costs. In addition,
IPL's rate authority provides for a return on IPL's investment and recovery of the depreciation and operation and maintenance expenses associated with certain
IURC-approved environmental investments. The trackers allow IPL to recover the cost of qualifying investments, including a return on investment, without the need for a general rate case. 

        IPL
may apply to the IURC for a change in its fuel charge every three months to recover its estimated fuel costs, including the energy portion of purchased power costs, which may be
above or below the levels included in its basic rates and charges. IPL must present evidence in each fuel adjustment charge ("FAC") proceeding that it has made every reasonable effort to acquire fuel
and generate or purchase power, or both, so as to provide electricity to its retail customers at the lowest cost reasonably possible. 

33




 

<A
HREF="#bg19101a_main_toc">Table of Contents

        Independent
of the IURC's ability to review basic rates and charges, Indiana law requires electric utilities under the jurisdiction of the IURC to meet operating expense and income test
requirements as a condition for approval of requested changes in the FAC. Additionally, customer refunds may result if IPL's rolling 12-month operating income, determined at
quarterly measurement dates, exceeds IPL's authorized annual net operating income and there are not sufficient applicable cumulative net operating income deficiencies against which the
excess rolling twelve month net operating income can be offset. 

        In
IPL's two most recently approved FAC filings (FAC 81 and 82), the IURC found that IPL's rolling annual jurisdictional retail electric net operating
income was lower than the authorized annual jurisdictional net operating income. However, in IPL's FAC 76 through 80 filings, the IURC found that IPL's rolling annual
jurisdictional retail electric net operating income was greater than the authorized annual jurisdictional net operating income. Because IPL has a cumulative net operating income
deficiency, IPL has not been required to make customer refunds in their FAC proceedings. However, in an effort to allay concerns raised by the IURC regarding IPL's level of earnings, in
IPL's IURC approved FAC 79 and 80 IPL provided voluntary credits to its retail customers totaling $30 million and $2 million, respectively. IPL recorded a
$30 million deferred fuel regulatory liability in March 2008 and a $2 million deferred fuel regulatory liability in June 2008, with corresponding and respective reductions against
revenues for these voluntary credits. Approximately $30.3 million has been applied in the form of offsets against fuel charges that customers would have otherwise been billed during
June 1, 2008 through December 31, 2008 and approximately $1.7 million remains to be applied as of December 31, 2008. 


        IPL
has participated in the restructured wholesale energy market since its implementation April 1, 2004. The restructured wholesale energy market is operated by Midwest
Independent System Operator, Inc. ("MISO") and under the jurisdiction of the FERC. Prior to the implementation of these markets, IPL dispatched its generation and purchased power resources
directly to meet its demands. In the MISO markets, IPL is obligated to offer its generation and to bid its demand into the market on an hourly basis. The MISO settles these hourly offers and bids
based on location based marginal prices (i.e., pricing for energy at a given location based on a market clearing price that takes into account physical limitations, generation and demand
throughout the MISO region). The MISO evaluates the market participants' energy injections into, and withdrawals from, the system to economically dispatch the entire MISO system on a
five-minute basis. Market participants are able to hedge their exposure to congestion charges, which result from constraints on the transmission system, with certain Financial Transmission
Rights ("FTRs"). Participants are allocated FTRs each year and are permitted to purchase additional FTRs. As anticipated, and in keeping with similar market start-ups around the world,
location marginal prices are volatile, and there are process, data and model issues requiring editing and enhancement. IPL and other market participants have raised concerns with certain MISO
transactions and the resolution of those items could impact our results of operations. 

        In
IPL's March 2006 proceeding (FAC 71) before the IURC, a consumer advocacy group representing some of IPL's industrial customers requested that a
sub-docket be established. Through the sub-docket, the industrial group was seeking a review of various FAC components including a review of IPL's treatment of
transmission losses through ISO and an IURC order requiring IPL to provide customer refunds for past charges and changes to future ratemaking. Because of the uncertain outcome of the FAC 71
sub-docket, the IURC orders in IPL's FAC 71 through 81 proceedings had approved IPL's FAC factors on an interim basis, subject to refund. In December 2008,
the IURC issued an order in which it determined that IPL should continue its current treatment of transmission losses and therefore removed the "subject to refund" provisions in its FAC 71 through 81
orders, as it pertains to the FAC 71 sub-docket. 

        Mexico.    Mexico has a single national electricity grid (referred to as the "National Interconnected System"), covering nearly all of
Mexico's
territory. The only exception is the Baja California peninsula 

34




 

<A
HREF="#bg19101a_main_toc">Table of Contents



which
has its own separate electricity system. Article 27 of the Mexican Constitution reserves the generation, transmission, transformation, distribution, and supply of electric power
exclusively to the Mexican State for the purpose of providing a "public service". The Federal Electricity Commission ("CFE"), by virtue of Article 1 of the Energy Law, is granted sole and
exclusive responsibility for providing this public service as it relates to the supply, transmission and distribution of electric power. 

        In
1992, the Energy Law was amended to allow private parties to invest in certain activities in the Mexico electrical power market, under the assumption that "self-supply"
generation of electric power is not considered a public service. These reforms allowed private parties to obtain permits from the Ministry of Energy for (i) generating power for
self-supply; (ii) generating power through co-generation processes; (iii) generating power through independent production; (iv) small-scale production and
(v) importing and exporting electrical power. Beneficiaries holding any of the permits contemplated under the Energy Law are required to enter into PPAs with the CFE with regard to all surplus
power produced. It is under this basis that AES's Mérida ("Mérida") and TEG/TEP facilities operate. Mérida, a majority owned 484 MW generation
business, provides power exclusively to CFE under a long-term contract. TEG/TEP provides the majority of its output to two offtakers under long-term contracts, and can sell any
excess or surplus energy produced to CFE at a predetermined day-ahead price. 


 Europe & Africa  

        European Union.    European Union ("EU") member states are required to implement EU legislation, although there is a degree of disparity as
to how such
legislation is implemented and the pace of implementation in the respective member states. EU legislation covers a range of topics which impact the energy sector, including market liberalization and
environmental legislation. The Company has subsidiaries which operate existing generation businesses in a number of countries which are member states of the EU, including the Czech Republic, Hungary,
the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. The Company also has subsidiaries which are in the process of constructing a generation plant in Bulgaria. Bulgaria became a member state of the EU as of
January 1, 2007. 

        The
principles of market liberalization in the EU electricity and gas markets were introduced under the Electricity and Gas Directives. In 2005, the European Commission ("the
Commission"), the legislative and administrative body of the EU, launched a sector-wide inquiry into the European gas and electricity markets. In the context of the electricity market, the
inquiry has to date focused on identifying issues related to price formation in the electricity wholesale markets and the role of long-term agreements as a possible barrier to entry with a
view to improving the competitive situation. In January 2007, the Commission published a proposal for a new common energy policy for Europe. In November 2008, the Commission published a second
Strategic Energy Review aimed at developing the concept of a common European Energy Policy. It focused mainly on security of supply and infrastructure development. The Strategic Energy Review proposed
reviews of the Gas Storage Directive in 2010 and an update of the Oil Stocks Directives. 

        In
October 2008, Energy Ministers reached political agreement on the "Third Liberalism Package," which includes five pieces of legislation, Electricity and Gas Directives, Electricity
and Gas Regulations and Agency Regulation, which are expected to be passed by Parliament in early 2009 and come into force at the national level in 2009/2010. Little progress was made on this
legislation during the fourth quarter of 2008, as legislative efforts focused instead on the "Green Package." The Green Package consists of 3 directives (Carbon Capture & Storage, EU Emissions
Trading Scheme ("ETS"), and the Renewables Directive) which were agreed by the European Parliament in December 2008, along with a decision on Green House Gas burden sharing. The key elements of the
Green Package include: 



•A 20% reduction in EU GHG emissions by 2020, as compared with 1990 levels, or 30% if other developed nations agree to take
similar action by 2020; 

35




 

<A
HREF="#bg19101a_main_toc">Table of Contents





•The ETS caps will deliver 21% GHG reduction by 2020 compared to 2005, distribution will be skewed to favor lower GDP
member states, and auctioning will be phased in for some member states power sectors;   
•20% increase in energy efficiency; and   
•Minimum 10% target for renewable energy by 2020. 


        Progress
in the implementation of the directives referred to above varies from member state to member state. AES generation businesses in each member state will be required to comply
with the relevant measures taken to implement the directives. See "Air Emissions" below, for a description of these Directives. 

         Kazakhstan.    Under the present regulatory structure, the electricity generation and supply sector in Kazakhstan is mainly regulated by
the Ministry of
Energy and Mineral Resources (the "Ministry"), the Agency for protection of competition (the "AZK") and the Agency for Regulation of Natural Monopolies (the "Agency"). Each has the necessary authority
for the supervision of the Kazakhstan power industry. However, the continuous changes in the law result in certain contradictions between different laws and regulations. This in turn results in
uncertainty in the regulatory environment of the power sector. 

        Kazakhstan
has a wholesale power market, where generators and customers are free to sign contracts at negotiated prices. The power market infrastructure is evolving into a functioning
centralized trading system. Since 2004, power producers, guaranteed suppliers and wholesale traders have been required to purchase and sell part of their electricity volumes on the electronic
centralized power trading market. State-owned entities and natural monopolies are obligated to buy power through tenders and centralized trading. The wholesale transmission grid is owned by
state-owned company KEGOC, which also acts as the system operator. The government is planning to introduce a real-time balancing market in 2009. 

        To
date, the Agency approves and regulates all tariffs for power transmission and distribution. Under the law, power companies which the AZK considers dominant entities must notify the
Agency of the proposed increase of their prices and the Agency has the right to veto such proposed tariff increases. Further, the Agency has the right to request a decrease in the applicable tariffs
and/or request introduction of the fixed prices for those power companies with prior record of anti-monopoly violations. In addition, the government introduced price regulation of the
power sales from the Northern zone of the wholesale market to the southern region of Kazakhstan, and power companies involved in such transactions require approval for any tariff increase from the
AZK. 

        Two
hydro plants which are under AES concession, Ust-Kamenogorsk and Shulbinsk, together with Ust-Kamenogorsk TET, all located in the Eastern Kazakhstan region,
are recognized by the AZK as dominant entities in the Eastern Kazakhstan regional market because their aggregated share in the electricity supply commodity market in the region is 70%. These
businesses are required to notify the AZK about any power price increases for regional customers. Additionally, in December 2008, Shulbinsk was included in the dominant companies list for the
Taldykorgan region and Irtysh Power and Light together with Sogrinsk CHP were included in the dominant list of the East
Kazakhstan region. Ekibastuz GRES, which is under AES management, must obtain approval from the AZK for power price increases for its customers in the southern region of Kazakhstan. 

        Effective
January 1, 2008, the Prime Minister of Kazakhstan ordered all generating plants in Kazakhstan to maintain fourth quarter 2007 price levels through the first quarter of
2008 in order to help moderate high inflation rates in Kazakhstan. Beginning in April 2008, the government permitted power plants to increase the electricity tariffs charged to their electricity
retail companies by 13.6% for the remainder of 2008 and eliminated the electricity price restrictions for other customers. 

36




 

<A
HREF="#bg19101a_main_toc">Table of Contents

        In
2008, the parliament adopted a new competition law and amendments to the Electricity Law and Natural Monopoly legislation, which became effective as of January 2009. According to the
new amendments to the Electricity Law, the Ministry should determine the groups of technologically identical power generation companies and set upper price ceilings for each group of power companies
for seven years. In cases where such price ceiling is too low to support new investments, a power generation company will be able to apply for investment tariffs. The Ministry and the AZK have rights
jointly to approve the investment programs, approve the investment tariffs and sign an investment contract with a power company. The legislation envisages large fines in the case of failures to
implement investment programs. Trading companies will be prohibited and power plants will be able to conduct trading activities only in order to provide electricity supply to its customers during
emergency shutdowns. 

        The
new competition law excludes from the list of antimonopoly violations agreed actions between affiliated companies. Amendments to the Natural Monopoly law give additional authority to
the Agency to control allowed costs of natural monopoly companies and impose responsibility on these companies to eliminate non-technical losses within the timeframes set by the Agency.
The law eliminates the price regulation of power companies recognized as dominant entities and the price regulation of power sales from the Northern to the southern region of Kazakhstan. 

        In
2008, the Company, through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary, sold its assets in Northern Kazakhstan, including AES Ekibastuz LLP, the operator of the AES Ekibastuz power
plant, and Maikuben West LLP, the owner of the AES Maikuben coal mine. In 2008, the Company continued to manage these businesses pursuant to a management agreement. The Company is retaining its
facilities in Eastern Kazakhstan, including Sogrinsk CHP and Ust-Kamenogorsk CHP; its facilities under concession agreements, Shulbinsk HPP and Ust-Kamenogorsk HPP; and its
trading business, Nurenergoservice L.L.P. 

         Cameroon.    The law governing the Cameroonian electricity sector was passed in December 1998. The regulator is the Electricity Sector
Regulatory Agency
("ARSEL") and its role is regulating and ensuring the proper functioning of the electricity sector, supervising the process of granting concessions, licenses and authorizations to
operators, monitoring the application of the electricity regulation by the operators of the sector, approving and/or publicizing the regulated tariffs in the sector and safeguarding the interests of
electricity operators and consumers. ARSEL has the legal status of a Public Administrative Establishment and is placed under the dual technical supervisory authority of the Ministries charged with
electricity and finance. 

        The
concession agreement of July 2001 between the Republic of Cameroon and Sonel covers a twenty-year period. The first three years constituted a grace period to permit
resolution of issues existing at the time of the privatization. In 2006, Sonel and the Cameroonian government signed an amended concession agreement. The amendment updates the schedule for investments
to more than double the number of people Sonel serves over the next 15 years and provides for upgrading the generation, transmission and distribution system. Additionally, the concession
agreement amended the tariff structure that results in an electricity price based on a reasonable return on the generation, transmission and distribution asset base and a pass through of a portion of
fuel costs associated with increased thermal generation in years when hydrology is poor. The amended concession agreement has also reduced the cost of connection to facilitate access to electricity in
Cameroon. 

         Nigeria.    Nigeria's electricity sector consists of a generation market comprised of approximately 6 GW of installed capacity, with the
state-owned
entity, Power Holding Company of Nigeria ("PHCN") holding approximately 88% of the market share and two IPPs holding the remaining 12%. The IPPs, of which AES Nigeria Barges Ltd. ("AESNB") is
one, maintain long term contracts with PHCN as the sole offtaker. 

        All
of Nigeria's distribution and transmission networks and companies are owned by state entities. 

37




 


<A
HREF="#bg19101a_main_toc">Table of Contents

        In
March 2005, President Obasanjo signed the Power Sector Reform Bill into law, enabling private companies to participate in transmission and distribution in addition to electricity
generation that had previously been legalized. The government has separated PHCN into eleven distribution firms, six generating companies, and a transmission company, all of which plan to be
privatized. Several problems, including union opposition, have delayed the privatization indefinitely. However, it is envisaged that after the privatization process, the power sector will transform
into a fully liberalized market. 

        The
Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission ("NERC") has also been established to regulate the electricity sector including the setting of tariffs and industry standards for future
electricity sector development. NERC has asked the Company to revalidate our generation license. As part of the revalidation exercise, NERC is imposing certain conditions on the Company which are in
conflict with its PPA and which may result in additional costs. The Company is reviewing the terms of the new license and plans to negotiate its terms and conditions to make them more consistent with
our existing PPA. At this time, it is not clear what might be the final outcome of these negotiations. Under the terms of the PPA, the Company has a right to pass through any such additional cost and
there is no cap. At present we estimate that the additional cost, if any, due to the license will be about $1 million. 

         Hungary.    The Hungarian market has one main interconnected system. The state-owned electricity wholesaler, MVM, is the dominant exporter,
 importer and
wholesaler of electricity. MVM's affiliated company, MAVIR is the Hungarian transmission system operator. Currently, Hungary is dependent on energy imports (mainly from Russia) since domestic
production only partially covers consumption. Magyar Energia Hivatal (MEH), is the government entity responsible for regulation of the electricity industry in Hungary. 

        With
the adoption of a new Electricity Act by Hungary in 2007, which became effective January 1, 2008, Hungary is taking the final legislative step to implement a fully
liberalized electricity market. By virtue of the Electricity Act, all customers become eligible to choose their electricity supplier. In the competitive market, generators sell capacity to wholesale
traders, distribution companies, other generators, electricity traders and eligible customers at an unregulated price. 

        Shortly
before its accession to the European Union, the Hungarian government notified the European Commission of arrangements concerning compensation to the state owned electricity
wholesaler, MVM. The Commission decided to open a formal investigation in 2005 to determine whether or not any government subsidies were provided by MVM to its suppliers which were incompatible with
the common market. In June 2008, the Commission reached its decision that the PPAs, including AES Tisza's PPA, contain elements of illegal state aid. The decision requires Hungary to terminate the
PPAs within six months of the June 2008 publication of the decision, and to recover the alleged illegal state aid from the generators within ten months of publication. Hungary and the Commission are
in the process of resolving confidentiality matters relating to the wording of the decision, which has not yet been notified by the Commission to the generators. AES Tisza is challenging the
Commission's decision in the Court of First Instance of the European Communities. Referring to the Commission's decision, Hungary adopted act number LXX of 2008 which terminates all
long-term PPAs in Hungary, including AES Tisza's PPA, as of December 31, 2008, and requires generators to repay the alleged illegal state aid that was allegedly received by the
generators through the PPAs, and provides for the possibility to offset stranded costs of the generators from the repayable state aid. Depending on the outcome of these events, there could be a
material impact on the Company. 

        At
the end of 2006 and for all of 2007, the Hungarian government reintroduced administrative pricing for all electricity generators, overriding PPA pricing, including the pricing in AES
Tisza's PPA. In January 2007, AES Summit Generation Limited, a holding company associated with AES Tisza's operations in Hungary, and AES Tisza notified the Hungarian government of a dispute
concerning its 

38




 

<A
HREF="#bg19101a_main_toc">Table of Contents



acts
and omissions related to AES's substantial investments in Hungary in connection with the reintroduction of the administrative pricing for Hungarian electricity generators. In conjunction with
this, AES Summit and AES Tisza have commenced International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes ("ICSID") arbitration proceedings against Hungary under the Energy Charter Treaty in connection
with Hungary's reintroduction of the administrative pricing for Hungarian electricity generators. In the meantime, pursuant to the new Electricity Act in force from January 1, 2008,
administrative pricing for electricity generators was subsequently abolished. 

        Hungary,
pursuant to act number LXVII of 2008 introduced a special tax to be levied on energy companies including companies such as AES Tisza. The rate of the special tax is 8% and it is
valid for two years, i.e., 2009 and 2010. 

         Ukraine.    The electricity sector in Ukraine is regulated by the National Energy Regulatory Commission ("NERC"). Electricity costs to end
users in
Ukraine consist of three main components: 1) the wholesale market tariff is the price at which the distributor purchases energy on the wholesale market, 2) the distribution tariff covers
the cost of transporting electricity over the distribution network, 3) the supply tariff covers the cost of supplying electricity to an end user. The total cost permitted by the regulator under
the distribution and supply tariff each year is referred to as DVA. The distribution and supply tariffs for the five privatized distribution companies in Ukraine are established by the NERC on an
annual basis, at which time an operational expense allowance is adjusted for inflation and the tariff is adjusted for the amount of capital that was invested for the year and the amount of energy that
was distributed. A change in the methodology was effected at the end of 2007 with respect to the treatment of wages and salaries such that the adjustment for inflation replaced by an allowance based
on the average industrial wage in the country. 

        Due
to Parliamentary elections in 2006, there were significant staff changes in the key regulatory agencies. In particular, a new Minister of Energy and a new NERC Chairman were
appointed. NERC twice authorized 25% increases in end user tariffs for residential customers in 2006. During 2006, the wholesale electricity market price increased approximately 18% due to increases
in fuel prices and changes in the pricing arrangements for thermal generating companies. During 2007, the wholesale electricity market price increased by 21% and during 2008, it increased by 49%. 


        At
the end of 2008, the tariff methodology for the calculation of the DVA in AES Ukraine's tariffs was to be comprehensively reviewed, including the rate of return on initial investment,
operational expenses
treatment, and definition and valuation of the rate base. However, in late 2008, NERC introduced minimal and short term changes into the tariff methodology with a view to delaying a comprehensive
review until 2010. The delay is due to NERC's intention to develop a new methodology applicable to all distribution and supply companies. Short term changes implemented in 2009 include
(a) setting rates of return on initial investment at the level of 15% after tax for 2009, (b) wages and salaries treatment remaining as per the mechanism introduced in 2007,
(c) operational expenses subject to indexation by inflation and (d) other operational expenses subject to adjustment based on actual expenses given reasonable substantiation. In 2010, a
comprehensive tariff methodology review will take place addressing the issues of (1) rate of return on investment, (2) rate base revaluation, and (3) operational expense allowance
treatment. 

        During
the tariff review for 2009, NERC policies were directed by the provisions of the Presidential decree "On Additional Measures for Overcoming the Financial Crisis". This decree
introduced a moratorium on natural monopolists' price increases until the financial situation in the Ukraine stabilizes. The DVA (total cost permitted in tariffs) approved for 2009, however, increased
3.8% for AES Kievoblenergo and 5.4% for AES Rivneenergo. 

        United Kingdom.    AES Kilroot ("Kilroot") is subject to regulation by the Northern Ireland Authority for Utility Regulation ("NIAUR").
Under the terms
of the generating license granted to Kilroot, the NIAUR has the right to review and, subject to compliance with certain procedural steps 

39

and
conditions, require the early termination in 2010 of the long-term PPAs under which Kilroot currently supplies electricity to Northern Ireland Electricity ("NIE") until 2024. 

        On
March 21, 2007, Order 2007 (Single Wholesale Market—Northern Ireland) was enacted, which provided for the introduction and regulation of a single wholesale
electricity market for Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland that began operation in November of 2007. The legislation grants powers to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, or
NIAER, for a period of two years to modify existing arrangements within the electricity market in Northern Ireland, including the power to modify existing licenses and/or require the amendment or
termination of existing agreements or arrangements, to allow for the creation of a single wholesale electricity market. Modifications have been made to Kilroot's license and agreements to accomplish
the objectives of the single market and to allow for the separation of NIE into constituent bodies and the extraction of the management of the transmission system ("SONI") from NIE. These activities
have been completed with reasonably minimal impact and with the maintenance of existing underlying guarantees for Kilroot. 

        Revenues
from the new market include a regulated capacity and an energy payment based on the system marginal price ("SMP"). Bidding principles restrict bids to short run marginal cost
("SRMC"). Total annual capacity payments are calculated as the product of the annualized fixed cost of a best new
entrant ("BNE") peaking plant multiplied by the capacity required to meet the security standard. This capacity pot is then distributed on the basis of plant availability. 

        Despite
the new market mechanisms, Kilroot has continued to operate under its existing PPA which is able to subsist within the single wholesale market, although operating dispatch
instructions are now a function of the new market inputs and system constraints and no longer the exclusive decision of NIE. The impact on the business has been minimal as the relatively higher price
of gas has led Kilroot (a coal-fired plant) to be dispatched consistently during peak winter demand. However, NIAUR sought to invoke the introduction of the single electricity market ("SEM") as a
rationale for the early termination in 2010 of the long-term PPAs between Kilroot and NIE. Kilroot challenged by way of judicial review proceedings the determination of NIAUR that the
introduction of the SEM constituted requisite arrangements to allow such early termination. The hearing duly took place in May 2008 and found in favor of the Regulator. Although this grants the
ability to the Regulator to terminate the contracts from 2010, the current expectation is that due to the value of the CO2 allowances (that passes through to the consumer while Kilroot is
under contract), the likely earliest date that cancellation would be invoked is after 2012 (when free allowances are due to cease). 

        Following
receipt of a complaint from Friends of the Earth claiming that the existing long-term PPAs with NIE in Northern Ireland are incompatible with EU law, the EC has
requested certain information from the UK authorities related to these agreements, including information pertaining to the Kilroot power plant and PPA in order to enable the EC to assess the
complaint. The Department of Enterprise Trade and Investment ("DETI") submitted a response to the EC on January 12, 2007 and there have been no further developments. 

         Czech Republic.    The electricity industry in the Czech Republic is dominated by three vertically integrated companies ("CEZ", "E.ON" and
"PRE") that
both supply and distribute power. CEZ, which owns approximately 70% of the installed capacity, produced approximately 73% of the Czech Republic's energy in 2007. Electricity distribution is also
dominated by these three entities: CEZ (62%); E.ON (25%); and PRE (13%). There are 22 generators with installed capacity of over 50 MW and 25 generators with installed capacities
between 5-50 MW, none of which have a market share greater than 3%. In accordance with EU directives regarding market liberalization, all customers are able to select their energy
supplier. 

        Since
August 2007, the Prague Energy Exchange has been trading energy in the form of base load and peak load on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. The majority of electricity is,
however, still traded on a bilateral basis between generators and distributors, independent traders (there are six 

40




 

<A
HREF="#bg19101a_main_toc">Table of Contents



major
active traders plus more than 20 smaller traders in the market) and also between generators and final customers. In February 2008, a day ahead spot market was incorporated into the Energy
Exchange as existed in Slovakia. As of March 2009, the Prague Energy Exchange will also include Hungary
trades. AES Bohemia's electricity, steam, water and compressed air output is governed under bilateral contracts with industrial and municipal customers in the surrounding area. 


        Spain.    Spain is a member of the EU and as such the Spanish Government has been taking steps to liberalize the country's electricity
sector in
accordance with EU directives. Since January 1, 2003, all customers have been eligible to choose their electricity supplier. 

        AES
currently operates and holds a 71% ownership interest in a 1,199 MW natural gas-fired plant located in Cartagena on the southeast coast of Spain. The plant sells
energy into the Pan-Iberian electricity market ("MIBEL"). The MIBEL market was created in January 2004 when Spain and Portugal signed a formal agreement. This new market
allows generators in the two countries to sell their electricity on both sides of Spanish-Portuguese border as one single market. OMEL, Spain's energy market regulator and Portugal's equivalent, OMIP,
merged in April 2006, creating OMI, a single operator for the MIBEL electricity market, which began in the summer of 2006 with the objective of setting up a mechanism for harmonizing tariffs and of
integrating the current management functions of the spot and forward markets. 

        The
state-owned transmission company, Red Eléctrica de España ("REE") owns 99% of the 400 kilovolt ("kV") grid and 98% of the 220 kV network. REE also
operates as system operator and is responsible for technical management of the system and for monitoring transmission. Under the country's energy plan, REE plans to invest in strengthening the
mainland grid, connecting new plants and improving interconnection throughout the country. Cartagena has two agreements in place with the REE: one governing the construction of the interconnection and
the other specifying the specific terms and conditions of access. 

        In
September 2002, the Spanish Cabinet approved a 10-year energy plan which focuses on meeting the country's future energy requirements. The plan also reflects reliance on
Special Systems which represents energy output from the facilities supplied by renewable energy sources, waste and cogeneration plants, and provides for new renewable tariffs (Royal Decree 661/207)
and favorable regulation. 

        Turkey.    The wholesale generation and distribution market in Turkey is primarily a bilateral market dominated by state-owned entities.
The state-owned
Electricity Generation Company ("EUAS") and its subsidiaries comprise approximately 24 GW of generation capacity and represent approximately 48% of the market. Private producers (with public off take)
account for another 35%, and auto-producers and other industrial parties, the remaining 17%. The transmission network is owned and controlled by TEIAS, the State Transmission Company.
TETAS, the Wholesale Market Pool, sets wholesale price based on average procurement costs from EUAS, auto-producers and Build Own Operate/Build Own Transfer/Transfer of Operating Rights
producers. This wholesale price represents the buying price for TEDAS, the State Distribution
Company, which controls distribution in 20 out of 21 regions. There is also a balancing spot market, with prices typically 20% higher than TETAS, which is growing and has a capacity of 70 Gigawatt
hours ("GWh") of daily trade. The automatic price mechanism which is meant to halt the government subsidization has been approved, and implementation commenced in July 2008. With this mechanism, all
major cost items (foreign exchange, gas price increases, inflation, among others) are expected to be reflected in the tariff. As a result, mid term market wholesale prices are expected to converge to
the current spot market prices. 


        Distribution
companies can procure 100% of their needs from TETAS, but can also source up to 15% from other sources. Additionally, eligible customers, using greater than 1.2 GWh
annually, can contract through channels other than TEDAS.

        Retail
electricity prices are determined by the distribution company or companies and approved by the electricity regulator, EMRA. 


        Turkey
has introduced a "renewable" feed-in tariff that sets a floor for renewable generation (wind and run of river hydro) for the first 10 years of operation. The
floor is between 5.0 - 5.5 € cents per kWh and decreed by EMRA each year. AES's Turkey hydro assets fall under the renewable feed-in
tariffs. 

        In
efforts to move to a fully liberalized market, Turkey began a formal tender process to privatize three of its distribution companies owned by the State Distribution Company in 2006.
As of the end of 2008, the distribution companies in four regions (Baskent, Sakarya, Konya and Aras) have been put out to tender and the remaining distribution companies are expected to be privatized
in 2009. The Turkish government has also announced plans to privatize all the state-owned generation assets by the 2009-2010 period, except for large hydro plants. 

 Asia & Middle East  

         China:    In 2005, the National Development and Reform Commission ("NDRC") released interim regulations governing on-grid tariffs, along
with two other regulations governing transmission and retail tariffs. Pursuant to the interim regulations, the on-grid tariffs shall be appraised and ratified by the pricing authorities by
reference to the economic life of power generation projects and determined in accordance with the principle of allowing IPPs to cover reasonable costs and to obtain reasonable returns. Such costs were
defined to be the average costs in the industry and reasonable returns will be calculated on the basis of the interest rate of China's long-term Treasury bond plus certain percentage
points. In addition to the foregoing tariff setting mechanism, China's central government also issued a tariff adjustment policy allowing the on-grid tariffs to be pegged to the fuel price
in the case of significant fluctuations in fuel price. Seventy percent of the increase in fuel costs may be passed through in the tariff. Pursuant to this policy, the tariffs of coal-fired
facilities in China were increased in 2005 and 2006, and there were two rounds of tariff increments in 2008 to alleviate the escalation of fuel price; however, such adjustments fell short of
compensating all businesses for coal price increases in 2008 in accordance with the above mentioned policy. 

        Pursuant
to the Renewable Energy Law of China, which came into effective on January 1, 2006, renewable resources such as wind,
solar, biomass, geo-thermal, and hydro enjoy unrestricted generation and dispatch, and local grid interconnection is mandated to such plants. With a view to implementing the Renewable
Energy Law, on August 2, 2007, various central government agencies jointly issued the Temporary Measures for Dispatching Electricity Generated by Energy Conservation
Projects. Under this regulation, power plants are categorized into various groups and each group will, under certain circumstances, enjoy priority dispatch over the subsequent
groups. The first group are renewable energy power plants, namely wind, hydro, solar, biomass, tidal-wave, geo-thermal and landfill gas power plants that satisfy certain
environmental standards. The second group is nuclear power plants. The third group is power plants using 'modern coal' which includes co-generation power plants, and power plants utilizing
residual heat, residual gas, coal-gangue (or waste coal) and coal mine methane. The last three groups are natural gas, conventional coal and oil-fired power plants. In other
words, power plants using renewable resources will enjoy priority dispatch over power plants using fossil fuels. This is in line with the requirement that renewable energy power plants will enjoy
unrestricted generation and dispatch under the Renewable Energy Law, as well as the Chinese government's policy objective to encourage comprehensive utilization of resources in an energy-efficient and
environmental-friendly manner. 

        In
2007, the Chinese government also issued a number of rules and procedures that govern the shutdown of small coal or oil-fired power plants. The types of plants to be
shutdown include: (i) power plants with a capacity under 50 MW; (ii) power plants with a capacity of up to 100 MW which are over 20 years old; (iii) power plants
with a capacity of up to 200 MW whose equipment has reached an end 

42




 

<A
HREF="#bg19101a_main_toc">Table of Contents



of
its useful life; and (iv) power plants that have coal consumption rates that are higher than either 10% above the applicable provincial average or 15% above the national average. The
shutdown procedures have been set in place to ensure that certain smaller power plants are appropriately shutdown and
replaced by larger and more efficient power plants. The purpose of such rules and regulations is again in accord with China's policy to achieve energy conservation and emission reduction. The Hefei
business, in which AES held a 70% interest, was shut down pursuant to this policy. A termination agreement with the offtaker was reached and executed on March 30, 2008 and the Hefei business
received a termination payment in the amount of $39 million on March 31, 2008. 

         India.    India's power sector is regulated by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission ("CERC") at the national level and respective
State
Electricity Regulatory Commissions ("SERCs") at the state level. CERC is responsible for regulating interstate generation and central transmission, while intra-state generation, distribution and
transmission are regulated by SERCs. 

        In
2003, the Government of India enacted the Electricity Act 2003 to establish a framework for a multi-seller-multi-buyer model for the electricity industry and introduced significant
changes in India's electricity sector. In accordance with the Electricity Act the Government of India came out with the National Electricity Policy in February 2005 and in January 2006 published the
National Tariff Policy. The policies established deadlines to implement different provisions of the Electricity Act. However, the pace of actual implementation of the reform process is contingent on
the respective state governments and SERCs, as electricity is a "concurrent" subject in India's constitution. 


        Under
the Electricity Act, there is no license required to set up generation plants and generators are allowed to sell to state utilities, traders, and open access consumers. The access
to consumers is subject to regulatory provisions on transmission corridor availability and payment of cross subsidy surcharge. Under the National Tariff Policy, sales since the end of 2006 from new
IPP's to distribution utilities are required to be on a competitive bidding basis. Two power exchanges have received licenses from CERC and have started operations in the past year. However, the
volume of power trading on the power exchanges is short term and small, as the bulk of power is still traded through long term bilateral contracts. 


        Philippines.    The Philippines have three major island grids—Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. Luzon is the largest grid, accounting for
79%
and 71% respectively of installed capacity and gross generation. The Luzon and Visayas grids are interconnected through undersea cables. In June 2001, the Philippines Congress issued the Electric
Power Industry Reform Act of 2001 ("EPIRA"), aiming at liberalizing the electricity sector, and transforming it from a single-buyer model in which National Power Company ("NPC") plays a dominant role
in generation, transmission, and distribution, to a competitive market model, in which NPC is privatized and competition is introduced in generation and distribution. 


        The
Energy Regulatory Commission ("ERC") was created to be the governing body for the restructured power industry and to promote competition, encourage market development, ensure
customer choice and penalize abuse of market power. As part of its role, the ERC regulates the rates
charged by transmission and distribution companies and as such approves cost recovery of contracts between generators and distribution companies. 

        The
Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation ("PSALM") was created in July 2001 to manage the sale, disposition and privatization of the NPC generation assets. As of
2008, PSALM has sold 2,771 MW of NPC owned generation assets (including the sale of the 660 MW Masinloc plant to AES), and is in the process of selling an additional 1,213 MW of
capacity. 

        EPIRA
mandates PSALM to select and appoint qualified entities called Independent Power Producer Administrators ("IPPA") to administer and manage the energy output that has been
contracted by NPC with IPPs. PSALM has initially appointed three independent trading teams to act as IPPA for these contracts, but it has now initiated the process for the sale of 1,700 MW of
contracted capacity.

        The Wholesale Electricity Spot Market ("WESM") started commercial operation in the Luzon grid in June 2006 with the primary objective of establishing a
competitive, efficient, transparent, and reliable spot market for electricity. The market is organized around both bilateral contracts and a mandatory pool and spot market with the spot market
consisting of an hour ahead market (ex-ante) and a real-time (ex-post) market. Each generating unit submits hourly bids. The dispatch is arranged by the lowest to
highest bid price and the spot price is set by the marginal price of the last dispatched unit following the merit order. 

 Environmental and Land Use Regulations  

         Overview.    The Company is subject to various international, national, state and local environmental and land use laws and regulations.
These laws and
regulations primarily relate to discharges into the air and air quality, discharge of effluents into water and the use of water, waste disposal, remediation, noise pollution, contamination at current
or former facilities or waste disposal sites, wetlands preservation
and endangered species. Many of the countries in which the Company does business also have laws and regulations relating to the siting, construction, permitting, ownership, operation, modification,
repair and decommissioning of, and power sales from, such assets. In addition, international projects funded by the International Finance Corporation, the private sector lending arm of the World Bank
are subject to World Bank environmental standards, which tend to be more stringent than local country standards. The Company often has used advanced environmental technologies (such as circulating
fluidized bed ("CFB") coal technologies or advanced gas turbines) in order to minimize environmental impacts. 


        Environmental
laws and regulations affecting electric power generation facilities are complex, change frequently and have become more stringent over time. The Company has incurred and
will continue to incur capital costs and other expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. See Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations—Capital Expenditures in this Form 10-K for more detail. If these regulations change or the enforcement of these regulations becomes more
rigorous, the Company and its subsidiaries may be required to make significant capital or other expenditures to comply. There can be no assurance that the businesses operated by the subsidiaries of
the Company would be able to recover any of these compliance costs from their counterparties or customers such that the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows
would not be materially adversely affected. 

        Various
licenses, permits and approvals are required for our operations. Failure to comply with permits or approvals, or with environmental laws, can result in fines, penalties, capital
expenditures, interruptions or changes to our operations. While the Company has at times been out of compliance with environmental laws and regulations, past non-compliance has not
resulted in the revocation of material permits or licenses and has not had a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions or results of operations and we have expeditiously corrected
the non-compliance as required. See Item 3—Legal Proceedings in this Form 10-K for more detail with respect to environmental disclosure. 

         Greenhouse Gas Laws, Protocols and Regulations.    In 2008, the Company's subsidiaries operated electric power generation businesses which
had total
approximate direct CO2 emissions of 83.8 million metric tonnes (ownership adjusted). Approximately 41.5 million metric tonnes of the 83.8 million metric tonnes were emitted in the United
States (both figures ownership adjusted). The following is an overview of both the regulations that currently apply to our businesses and those that may be imposed over the next few years. Such
regulations could have a material adverse effect on the electric power generation businesses of the Company's subsidiaries and on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial condition
and cash flows. In addition, while the Company through its climate solutions initiatives is developing and implementing projects to produce GHG offsets for use by the Company and/or for sale, as set
forth in the Risk Factor entitled " Our renewable energy projects and  

44




 


<A
HREF="#bg19101a_main_toc">Table of Contents



 other initiatives face considerable uncertainties including development, operational and regulatory challenges", there is no guarantee that these projects will be successful,
especially in light of the global
financial crisis and the Company's increased focus on preserving liquidity, which will likely result in slower growth for these activities. Further, even if our GHG offsets projects are successful,
the level of potential benefit is unclear given current uncertainties regarding legislation and/or litigation concerning GHG emissions. 


 International  

        In July 2003, the European Community "Directive 2003/87/EC on Greenhouse Gas Emission Allowance Trading" was created, which requires
member states to limit emissions of CO2 from large industrial sources within their countries. To do so, member states are required to implement EC-approved national allocation
plans ("NAPs"). Under the NAPs, member states are responsible for allocating limited CO2 allowances within their borders. Directive 2003/87/EC does not dictate how these allocations are to
be made, and NAPs that have been submitted thus far have varied their allocation methodologies. For these and other reasons, uncertainty remains with respect to the implementation of the European
Union Emissions Trading System ("EU ETS") that commenced in January 2005. The European Union has announced that it intends to keep the EU ETS in place after 2012, even if the Kyoto Protocol is not
extended. The Company's subsidiaries operate seven electric power generation facilities, and another subsidiary has one under construction, within six member states which have adopted NAPs to
implement Directive 2003/87/EC. Based on its current analyses, the Company does not expect that achieving and maintaining compliance with the NAPs to which its subsidiaries are subject will have a
material impact on its consolidated operations or results. In particular, the risk and benefit associated with achieving compliance with applicable NAPs at several facilities of the Company's
subsidiaries are not the responsibility of the Company's subsidiaries as they are subject to contractual provisions that transfer the costs associated with compliance to contract counterparties.
However, in the event that such counterparties challenge or dispute these provisions, there can be no assurance that the Company and/or the relevant subsidiary would prevail in any such dispute.
Furthermore, even if the Company and/or the relevant subsidiary does prevail, it would be subject to the cash and administrative burden associated with such dispute. Certain Company subsidiaries will,
however, bear some or all of the risk and benefit associated with compliance with applicable NAPs at certain facilities. Based upon anticipated operations, CO2 emission allowance
allocations, and the costs to acquire offsets and emission allowances for compliance purposes, the Company's subsidiaries have not to date incurred material costs to comply with Directive 2003/87/EC
and applicable NAPs, however, there can be no guarantees that compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business in future periods. 


        On
February 16, 2005, the Kyoto Protocol became effective. The Kyoto Protocol requires the industrialized countries that have ratified it to significantly reduce their GHG
emissions, including CO2. The vast majority of developing countries which have ratified the Kyoto Protocol have no GHG reduction requirements. Many of the countries in which the Company's
subsidiaries operate have no reduction obligations under the Kyoto Protocol. In addition, of the 29 countries that the Company's subsidiaries currently operate in, all but two—the United
States (including Puerto Rico) and Kazakhstan—have ratified the Kyoto Protocol. While we have developed and are implementing certain climate solutions projects under the Clean Development
and Joint Implementation Mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in developing these. To date, compliance with the Kyoto Protocol and EU ETS has not had a
material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In December 2008, a United Nations Climate Change Conference was held in
Poznan, Poland. Over 180 countries sent representatives and a majority agreed to continue to negotiate further reductions in GHG emissions for the period beginning after 2012 when Kyoto
Protocol expires. At present, the Company cannot predict 

45




 

<A
HREF="#bg19101a_main_toc">Table of Contents



whether
compliance with the Kyoto Protocol or any agreements reached at the Climate Change Conference will have a material impact on the Company in future periods. 

        Even
though it has been announced that the EU ETS will remain in place even if the Kyoto Protocol expires in 2012, there remains significant uncertainty with respect to the
implementation of NAPs post-2012. The EU has indicated that a portion of the emission allowances given to member states will need to be auctioned under the NAPs and the Company cannot
predict with any certainty if compliance with such programs will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated operations or results. 


        Countries
in Latin America and Asia in which subsidiaries of the Company operate may also choose to adopt regulations that directly or indirectly regulate GHG emissions from coal plants.
For example, in April 2008 a Chilean law, was enacted that requires a percentage of all new power purchase contracts held after August 31, 2007 be supplied by renewable sources. The Company's
subsidiary has developed a plan for complying with the law. See Regulatory Matters—Latin America—Chile. Another example is in China. One of the ways that China has chosen to
address its stated goals of energy conservation and CO2 emissions reduction is by putting regulations and procedures in place that govern the shut down of certain small coal and
oil-fired power plants and encourage replacement with larger more efficient power plants. The Hefei project, formerly operated by subsidiaries of the Company in China, was shut down
pursuant to these regulations. A termination agreement with the Hefei offtaker was executed on March 30, 2008 and a subsidiary of the Company received a termination payment in the amount of
$39 million on March 31, 2008. The Company does not currently anticipate that implementation of such regulations would have a material adverse affect on the Company's consolidated
financial condition or results of operations. See Regulatory Matters—Asia & Middle East—China. Although the Company does not currently believe that CO2 laws
and regulations that have been adopted to date in countries in Latin America and Asia in which subsidiaries of the Company operate will have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated
financial condition or results of operations, the Company cannot predict with any certainty if future laws and regulations in these countries regarding CO2 emissions will
have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 

 United States  

        Currently in the United States there are no Federal mandatory GHG emissions reduction programs (including CO2) affecting
the electric power generation facilities of the Company's subsidiaries. The U.S. Congress is debating a number of proposed GHG legislative initiatives, but to date there have been no new federal laws
regulating GHG emissions. Although several bills have been introduced in the U.S. Congress that would require reductions in CO2 emissions, the Company is not able to predict whether any
federal mandatory CO2 emissions reduction program will be adopted and implemented in the immediate future. The new administration has, however, requested the development of new federal
proposals by Congress and the U.S. EPA that could lead to the adoption of a mandatory program to reduce GHG emissions through, for example, an economy-wide
cap-and-trade program, a carbon tax or a combination of both. The Company will continue to monitor new developments with respect to the possible federal regulation of
CO2 emissions from electricity power generation facilities. 

        On
April 2, 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in a case involving the regulation of CO2 emissions from motor vehicles under the U.S. Clean Air Act
("CAA"). The Court ruled that CO2 is a pollutant which potentially could be subject to regulation under the CAA and that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the "U.S. EPA") has a
duty to determine whether CO2 emissions contribute to climate change or to provide some reasonable explanation why it will not exercise its authority. In response to the Court's decision,
on July 11, 2008, the U.S. EPA issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking ("ANPR") to solicit public input on whether CO2 emissions should be 

46




 

<A
HREF="#bg19101a_main_toc">Table of Contents



regulated
from both mobile and stationary sources under the CAA. The U.S. EPA has not yet made any such determination. However, the Court's decision and stimulus from the new administration,
regulators, members of Congress, states, non-governmental organizations, private parties and the courts and other factors could lead to a determination by the U.S. EPA to regulate
CO2 emissions from mobile and stationary sources, including electric power generation facilities. The Company will continue to monitor developments with respect to the regulation of
CO2 emissions under the CAA. 

        Ten
northeastern states have entered into a memorandum of understanding under which the states coordinate to establish rules that require reductions in CO2 emissions from
power plant operations within those states. This initiative is called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative ("RGGI"). A number of these states in which our subsidiaries have generating facilities,
including Connecticut, Maryland, New York and New Jersey, have implemented rules to effectuate RGGI. RGGI, which became effective January 1, 2009, imposes a cap on baseline CO2
emissions during the 2009 through
2014 period, and mandates a ten percent reduction in CO2 emissions during the 2015 to 2019 period. RGGI establishes a cap-and-trade program whereby power plants
will require a carbon allowance for each ton of CO2. Unlike the previously implemented federal sulfur dioxide ("SO2") and NOX cap-and-trade
emissions programs, RGGI requires that CO2 emitters acquire CO2 allowances either from a RGGI auction or in the secondary emissions trading market, except for several small
set-aside accounts for long term contracted plants and voluntary renewable energy. The auction rules include a minimum reserve price of $1.86 per allowance. This reserve price is subject
to change. In addition, the auction platform and auction results are subject to review by an independent market monitoring firm. The first such auction occurred on September 25, 2008 and the
clearing price per allowance was $3.07. The second such auction occurred on December 17, 2008 and the clearing price per allowance was $3.38. The third such auction is scheduled for
March 18, 2009. 

        The
Company's Eastern Energy business is located in New York. Under the New York RGGI rule, each budgeted source of CO2 emissions is required to surrender one CO2
allowance for each CO2 metric tonne emitted during a three-year compliance period. All fossil fuel powered generating facilities in New York that have a generating capacity of
25 or more MW are subject to the rule. In January 2009, Indeck Energy brought a legal challenge to the regulations adopted by three New York State agencies to implement RGGI. The Company will closely
monitor developments with respect to this litigation. 

        The
Company's Thames business is located in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut passed legislation, effective July 1, 2007, which requires that the Connecticut Department of
Environmental Protection develop necessary regulations to implement RGGI. The regulations adopted to implement RGGI include an auction of CO2 emission allowances except for several
set-aside accounts. AES Thames is eligible for a set-aside for the first compliance period, 2009-2011, which allows CO2 allowances to be purchased at $2
per allowance in 2009, and $2 per allowance plus a consumer price indexing in years 2010 and 2011. Eligibility for the second compliance period, 2012-2014, is still to be determined. 

        The
Company's Warrior Run business is located in Maryland. In April 2006, the Maryland General Assembly passed the Maryland Healthy Air Act which, among other thing things, required the
State of Maryland to join RGGI. The Maryland Department of Environment ("MDE") adopted regulations that require 100% of the allowances the State receives to be auctioned except for several small
allowance set-aside accounts. The Maryland MDE regulations include a safety valve to control the economic impact of the CO2 cap-and-trade program. If
the auction closing price reaches $7, up to 50% of a year's allowances will be reserved for purchase by electric power generation facilities located within Maryland at $7 per allowance, regardless of
auction prices. 

        The
Company's Red Oak business is located in New Jersey. The State of New Jersey adopted the Global Warming Response Act in July 2007 which established goals for the reduction of GHG
emissions in the State. In furtherance of these goals, in January 2008, additional state legislation

authorized
the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection ("NJDEP") to develop and adopt RGGI regulations and the NJDEP RGGI regulations became effective in 2008. The regulations adopted to
implement RGGI include an auction of CO2 emission allowances with procedures for the fixed-price sale of allowances to facilities with long-term power purchase contracts,
directs allocation of allowances to cogeneration facilities meeting specified thermal efficiency criteria, and includes a CO2 allowance set-aside designed to support the
voluntary renewable energy market. 

        In
2008, of the approximately 41.5 million metric tons of CO2 emitted in the United States by the businesses operated by our subsidiaries (ownership adjusted), approximately
11.8 million metric tonnes were emitted in U.S. states participating in RGGI. We believe that due to the absence of allowance allocations, RGGI could have a material adverse impact on the Company's
consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. While CO2 emissions from businesses operated by subsidiaries of the Company are calculated globally in metric
tonnes, RGGI allowances are denominated in short tons. (1 metric tonne equals 2,200 pounds and 1 short ton equals 2,000 pounds.) For forecasting purposes, the Company has modeled the
impact of CO2 compliance for 2009-2011 for its businesses that are subject to RGGI and that may not be able to pass through compliance costs. The model includes a conversion
from metric tonnes to short tons as well as the impact of some market recovery by merchant plants and contractual and regulatory provisions. The model also utilizes an allowance price of $3.38 per
allowance under RGGI. The source of this per tonne allowance estimate was the clearing price in the second RGGI allowance auction held in December 2008. Based on these assumptions, the Company
estimates that the RGGI compliance costs could be approximately $29.1 million per year from 2009 through 2011, which is the last year of the first RGGI compliance period. Given all of the
uncertainties surrounding RGGI, including the challenge to New York State's RGGI program and those discussed in the "Business—Regulatory Matters—Environmental and Land Use
Regulations" section of this Form 10-K, and the fact that the assumptions utilized in the model may prove to be incorrect, there is a significant risk that our actual compliance
costs under RGGI will differ from our estimates by a material amount and that our model could underestimate our costs of compliance. 

        The
Company's Southland and Placerita businesses are located in California. On September 27, 2006, the Governor of California signed the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, also
called Assembly Bill 32 ("A.B. 32"). A.B. 32 directs the California Air Resources Board to promulgate regulations that will require the reduction of CO2 and other GHG emissions to 1990
levels by 2020. On December 11, 2008, the California Air Resources Board unanimously adopted the Scoping Plan that outlines how the reductions in AB 32 will be met. The Scoping Plan follows
closely the recommendations put forth by the California Public Utilities Commission and the California Energy Commission on February 8, 2008, including the first jurisdictional deliverer being
the point of regulation for AB 32. A key component of the Scoping Plan is a cap-and-trade market that will be developed in coordination with the Western Climate Initiative as
detailed below. In addition, other key recommendations include increasing energy efficiency and increasing the renewable portfolio goals to 33%. This program is expected to become effective in 2012. 

        In
February 2007, the governors of the Western U.S. states (Arizona, New Mexico, California, Washington and Oregon) established the Western Climate Initiative ("WCI"). The WCI has since
been joined by two other states (Montana and Utah) and four Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec). Participating states and provinces have agreed to cut GHG emissions to
15% below 2005 levels by 2020 and they are considering the implementation of a cap-and-trade program for the electricity industry to achieve this reduction. On
September 23, 2008, the WCI issued its design recommendations for a cap-and-trade program which would apply to in-state electricity generators and the first
jurisdictional deliverer of electricity into a WCI partner state. The final regulatory design of this program is not yet known.

        The
Company owns IPL which is located in Indiana. On November 15, 2007, six Midwestern state governors (including the governor of Indiana) and the premier of Manitoba signed the
Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord ("MGGRA") committing the participating states and province to reduce GHG emissions through the implementation of a cap-and-trade
program. Three states (including Indiana) and the province of Ontario have signed as observers. 


        The
Company owns a power generation facility in Hawaii. On June 30, 2007, the governor of Hawaii signed GHG legislation. By December 1, 2009, Hawaii's Greenhouse Gas
Emissions Reduction Task Force will deliver to the legislature a work plan and regulatory scheme designed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by 2020. 

        At
this time, other then the estimated impact of CO2 compliance noted above for certain of its businesses that are subject to RGGI, the Company has not estimated the costs of
compliance with other potential U.S. federal, state or regional CO2 emissions reductions legislation or initiatives, such as A.B. 32, WCI, MGGRA and potential Hawaii regulations, due to
the fact that these proposals are in earlier stages of development and any final regulations, if adopted, could vary drastically from current proposals. Although complete specific implementation
measures for any federal regulations, A.B. 32, WCI, MGGRA and the Hawaiian regulations have yet to be finalized, these GHG-related initiatives will likely affect a number of the Company's
U.S. subsidiaries. Any federal, state or regional legislation or regulations adopted in the U.S. that would require the reduction of GHG emissions could have a material adverse effect on the Company's
consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 


        The
possible impact of any future federal legislation or regulations or any regional or state proposal will depend on various factors, including but not limited
to: 



•the geographic scope of legislation and/or regulation (e.g., federal, regional, state), which entities are subject
to the legislation and/or regulation (e.g., electricity generators, load serving entities, electricity deliverers, etc.), the enactment date of the legislation and/or regulation and the
compliance deadlines set forth therein;   
•the level of reductions of CO2 being sought by the regulation and/or legislation (e.g., 10%, 20%, 50%,
etc.) and the year selected as a baseline for determining the amount or percentage of mandated CO2 reduction (e.g., 10% reduction from 1990 CO2 emission levels, 20%
reduction from 2000 CO2 emission levels, etc.);   
•the legislative structure (e.g., a CO2 cap-and-trade program, a carbon tax,
CO2 emission limits, etc.);   
•in any cap-and-trade program, the mechanism used to determine the price of emission allowances or
offsets to be auctioned by designated governmental authorities or representatives;   
•the price of offsets and emission allowances in the secondary market, including any price floors on the costs of offsets
and emission allowances and price caps on the cost of offsets and emission allowances;   
•the operation of and emissions from regulated units;   
•the permissibility of using offsets to meet reduction requirements (e.g., type of offset projects allowed, the
amount of offsets that can be used for compliance purposes, any geographic limitations regarding the origin or location of creditable offset projects) and the methods required to determine whether the
offsets have resulted in reductions in GHG emissions and that those reductions are permanent (i.e., the verification method); 

49




 

<A
HREF="#bg19101a_main_toc">Table of Contents





•whether the use of proceeds of any auction conducted by responsible governmental authorities is reinvested in developing
new energy technologies, is used to offset any cost impact on certain energy consumers or is used to address issues unrelated to power;   
•how the price of electricity is determined at the affected businesses, including whether the price includes any costs
resulting from any new CO2 legislation and the potential to transfer compliance costs pursuant to legislation, market or contract, to other parties;   
•any impact on fuel demand and volatility that may affect the market clearing price for power;   
•the effects of any legislation or regulation on the operation of power generation facilities that may in turn affect
reliability;   
•the availability and cost of carbon control technology; and   
•any opportunities to change the use of fuel at the generation facilities of our subsidiaries or opportunities to increase
efficiency. 


 NY Consent Decree  

        In 2005, the Company entered into a Consent Decree (the "2005 Consent Decree") with the State of New York, and New York State Electric
and Gas Corporation ("NYSEG") which resolves violations of CAA requirements alleged to have occurred at the Greenridge, Westover, Jennison and Hickling plants prior to the Company's acquisition of
such plants. Under the terms of the 2005 Consent Decree, the Company is required to undertake projects to reduce emissions of air pollutants ("Upgrade Projects") or to cease operations of electric
generating units at the plants. The Company completed an Upgrade Project at Greenridge in 2006 and a similar project at Westover in 2008 and has ceased operations of the electric generating units at
Hickling and Jennison. In accordance with the 2005 Consent Decree, the Company is required to provide notifications to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation ("NYSDEC") regarding
the status of the Upgrade Projects and upon completion to propose new final emissions limits for NYSDEC's approval. The Company has received NYSDEC approval for proposed final emissions limits
applicable to AES Greenridge and will submit proposals for new final emission limits to NYSDEC for approval after the Upgrade Project at Westover completes commercialization testing and final
ratification in 2009. 

        Other Air Emission Regulations.    The CAA and various state laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants, including
SO2, NOx
and particulate matter ("PM"). The applicable rules and the steps taken by the Company to comply are discussed in further detail below. 

        Regarding
NOx emissions, the U.S. EPA has required adjustments to state implementation plans (the "NOx SIP Call") so that coal-fired electric generating facilities in 21 U.S.
states and the District of Columbia had to either (i) reduce their NOx emissions to levels equal to allowances under the plan or (ii) purchase NOx emissions allowances from other
operators to meet actual emissions levels by May 31, 2004. 

        Subsequently,
the U.S. EPA finalized two rules that are relevant to our U.S. coal-fired power plants. The first rule, the "Clean Air Interstate Rule" ("CAIR"), was
promulgated by the EPA on March 10, 2005, and required allowance surrender for SO2 and NOx emissions from existing power plants located in 28 eastern states and the District of
Columbia. CAIR contemplated two implementation phases. The first phase was to begin in 2009 and 2010 for NOx and SO2, respectively. A second phase with additional allowance surrender
obligations for both air emissions was to begin in 2015. To implement the required emission reductions for this rule, the states were to establish emission allowance-based
"cap-and-trade" programs. CAIR was subsequently challenged in federal court and on July 11, 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued an opinion
striking down CAIR. On September 19, 2008, EPA filed a petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc. On October 21, 

50




 

<A
HREF="#bg19101a_main_toc">Table of Contents



2008,
the Court issued an order requesting that certain petitioners, including AES Beaver Valley and AES Warrior Run, file a response to EPA's petition by November 5, 2008, indicating
whether any such petitioners were seeking a vacatur of CAIR and whether the Court should stay its mandate until EPA promulgates a revised rule. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had assets
of approximately $11.6 million related to these SO2 and NOx emission allowance programs. On December 23, 2008, the Court issued an opinion and order denying petitions for
rehearing and, rather than vacating CAIR as originally ordered, remanding the ease to EPA without vacatur to enable EPA to remedy CAIR's flaws in accordance with the Court's July opinion. While the
Court did not impose a timeline on EPA, the Court did indicate that the stay was not intended to be indefinite. 

        The
second rule, the Clean Air Mercury Rule ("CAMR"), was promulgated on March 15, 2006 and as proposed required reductions of mercury emissions from coal-fired power
plants in two phases. The first phase was to begin in 2010 and require nationwide reduction of coal-fired power plant mercury emissions from 48 to 38 tons per year. The second phase was to
begin in 2018 and require nationwide reduction of mercury emissions from these sources from 38 tons per year to 15 tons per year. CAMR also established stringent mercury emission performance standards
for new coal-fired power plants. However, on February 8, 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that CAMR as promulgated violated the CAA and
vacated the rule. U.S. EPA and an industry trade association subsequently appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. On February 3, 2009, an amendment to the CAA was introduced in the
U.S. House of Representatives that would require the EPA to promulgate mercury emission standards for electric generating units. The EPA would have one year from the date the amendment is enacted to
set maximum achievable control technology standards for electric generating units pursuant to Section 112 of the CAA. The amendment is designed to prevent EPA from regulating mercury emissions
through a cap-and-trade program. When the D.C. Circuit vacated CAMR in February 2008, the court did not rule on whether such programs violate the CAA. On February 6,
2009, the Acting Solicitor General of the United States filed a motion in the U.S. Supreme Court to dismiss the EPA's request for review of the D.C. Circuit's February 2008 decision which vacated
CAMR. According to the motion to dismiss, EPA intends to develop maximum achievable control technology standards for electric generating units pursuant to Section 112 of the CAA. The industry
trade association's appeal is still pending and the U.S. Supreme Court has not yet decided whether to hear the appeal. 


        Also,
a number of states have indicated that they intend to impose more stringent emission limitations on power plants within their states rather than promulgate rules consistent with
the originally contemplated CAIR and CAMR cap-and-trade programs. In response to CAIR, CAMR and potentially more stringent U.S. state initiatives on SO2 and NOx
emissions, subsidiaries of the Company completed installing selective catalytic reduction ("SCR") and other NOx control technologies at three coal-fired units of our subsidiary, IPL.
Subsidiaries of the Company also completed a multi-pollutant control project at its Greenridge power plant in the state of New York. In addition, Westover construction of a similar project at its
power plant in New York in 2008. The Westover project is expected to complete commercialization testing and final notification in 2009. In addition, a flue gas desulphurization scrubber upgrade
project was completed at the IPL Petersburg power plant, and construction of an SCR system at our Deepwater petroleum coke-fired power plant near Houston, Texas was completed in March
2007. 

        While
the exact impact and cost of CAIR, any new federal mercury rules and any related state proposals cannot be established until, in the case of CAIR, the states complete the process
of assigning emission allowances to our affected facilities, and in the case of the other rules, until they are promulgated, there can be no assurance that the Company's business, financial conditions
or results of operations would not be materially and adversely affected by such rules.

        NYSDEC previously promulgated regulations requiring electric generators to reduce SO2 emissions by 50% below current CAA standards. The
SO2 regulations began to be phased in beginning on January 1, 2006 with implementation to have been completed by January 1, 2008. These regulations also establish stringent
NOx reduction requirements year-round, rather than just during the summertime ozone season. 


        In
July 1999, the U.S. EPA published the "Regional Haze Rule" to reduce haze and protect visibility in designated federal areas. On June 15, 2005, U.S. EPA proposed amendments to
the Regional Haze Rule that, among other things, set guidelines for determining when to require the installation of "best available retrofit technology" ("BART") at older plants. The amendment to the
Regional Haze Rule required states to consider the visibility impacts of the haze produced by an individual facility, in addition to other factors, when determining whether that facility must install
potentially costly emissions controls. The Regional Haze Rule was further amended on October 6, 2006 when U.S. EPA promulgated a rule allowing states to impose alternatives to BART, including
emissions trading, if such alternatives were demonstrated to be more effective than BART. States were required to submit their regional haze state implementation plans to the U.S. EPA by December
2007. 

        In
Europe the Company is, and will continue to be, required to reduce air emissions from our facilities to comply with applicable EC Directives, including Directive 2001/80/EC on the
limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large combustion plants (the "LCPD"), which sets emission limit values for NOx, SO2, and particulate matter for large-scale
industrial combustion plants for all member
states. Until June 2004, existing coal plants could "opt-in" or "opt-out" of the LCPD emissions standards. Those plants that opted out will be required to cease all operations
by 2015 and may not operate for more than 20,000 hours after 2008. Those that opted-in, like the Company's AES Kilroot facility in the United Kingdom, must invest in abatement
technology to achieve specific SO2 reductions. Kilroot is installing a new flue gas desulphurization system that is scheduled for commission in the first quarter of 2009. The Company's
other coal plants in Europe are either exempt from the Directive due to their size or have opted-in but will not require any additional abatement technology to comply with the LCPD. 

         Water Discharges.    The Company's facilities are subject to a variety of rules governing water discharges. In particular the Company is
evaluating the
impact of the U.S. Clean Water Act Section 316(b) rule regarding existing power plant cooling water intake structures issued by the U.S. EPA in 2005 (69 Fed. Reg. 41579, July 9, 2004)
and the subsequent Circuit Court of Appeals decision which vacated significant portions of the rule (Docket Nos. 04-6692 to 04-6699). The rule as originally issued would
affect 12 of the Company's U.S. power plants and the rule's requirements would be implemented via each plant's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ("NPDES") water quality permit renewal
process. These permits are usually processed by state water quality agencies. To protect fish and other aquatic organisms, the 2004 rule requires existing steam electric generating facilities to
utilize the best technology available for cooling water intake structures. To comply, a steam electric generating facility must first prepare a Comprehensive Demonstration Study to assess the
facility's effect on the local aquatic environment. Since each facility's design, location, existing control equipment and results of impact assessments must be taken into consideration, costs will
likely vary. The timing of capital expenditures to achieve compliance with this rule will vary from site to site. On January 25, 2007 the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
decision (Docket Nos. 04-6692 to 04-6699) vacated and remanded major parts of the 2005 rule back to U.S. EPA. In November 2007, three industry petitioners sought review
of the Second Circuit's decision by the U.S. Supreme Court and this review was granted by the U.S. Supreme Court in April 2008. Oral arguments were held in December 2008 and a decision by the U.S.
Supreme Court is expected in 2009. The Second Circuit's decision, coupled with the appeal pending before the Supreme Court may result in further delays in implementing the rule at those affected
facilities located in states which have either not been delegated authority to implement Section 316(b) of the U.S. Clean Water Act or are awaiting more specific direction from the U.S. EPA
before proceeding. The U.S. EPA is currently drafting a new 

52

rule
to address the Second Circuit's decision and while a draft of the new rule is expected to be issued later this year, it is possible that the U.S. EPA could delay the issuance of the draft rule
pending a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court. Certain states in which the Company operates power generation facilities, such as New York, have been delegated authority and are moving forward with best
technology available determinations in the absence of any final rule from U.S. EPA. At present, the Company cannot predict whether compliance with the anticipated new 316(b) rule will have a material
impact on our operations or results. 

         Waste Management.    In the course of operations, the Company's facilities generate solid and liquid waste materials requiring eventual
disposal. With
the exception of coal combustion products ("CCP"), its wastes are not usually physically disposed of on our property, but are shipped off site for final disposal, treatment or recycling. CCP, which
consists of bottom ash, fly ash and air pollution control wastes, is disposed of at some of our coal-fired power generation plant sites using engineered, permitted landfills. Waste
materials generated at our electric power and distribution facilities include CCP, oil, scrap metal, rubbish, small quantities of industrial hazardous wastes such as spent solvents, tree and land
clearing wastes and polychlorinated biphenyl ("PCB") contaminated liquids and solids. The Company endeavors to ensure that all its solid and liquid wastes are disposed of in accordance with applicable
national, regional, state and local regulations.

  Subsequent Events        

        On December 23, 2008, in a transaction associated with the sale in November 2008 of 9.55% of the Company's shares in AES Gener,
as further discussed in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 17—Subsidiary Stock, the local Chilean SEC approved Gener's share issuance of
approximately 945 million shares at a price of $162.50 Chilean Pesos. The proceeds of the share issuance were $246 million and Gener anticipates using these proceeds for future expansion
plans, working capital and other operating needs. The preemptive rights period began on January 7, 2009 remained open for 30 days and closed on February 5, 2009. During the
preemptive rights period AES, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Cachagua, paid $175 million from the proceeds of the November 2008 share sale to maintain its current ownership percentage of
approximately 70%. 

        On
February 9, 2009, the government of the Dominican Republic, the government-owned power companies and the power companies sector ("generation companies"), signed two Memorandums
of Understanding (each an "MOU"). The first MOU provides for the settlement of outstanding 2008 accounts receivables ("2008 A/R") held by the generation companies from distribution
companies through the payment of government-issued bonds of which the Company's three generation businesses have been allocated $110 million. This MOU also states that the bonds can be used to
offset fiscal taxes, but that element will need to be approved by the National Congress of the Dominican Republic during their first legislative session of 2009. The second MOU acknowledges that the
bond payment does not fully satisfy the outstanding 2008 A/R balance. The residual amount outstanding after the bond payment will be fully settled by the distribution companies, within a
timeframe to be negotiated in the near future. 

        It
is AES' intention to accept these bonds as settlement for approximately $110 million of outstanding 2008 A/R, under the assumption that the bonds will have the ability
to offset fiscal taxes. The Company's businesses will have approximately $58 million of 2008 A/R outstanding after the bond payment that will be subject to the terms of the second MOU.
The intention of the distribution companies is to pay approximately $35 million of these receivables in 2009. Therefore, AES has appropriately reclassified $23 million to
long-term receivables on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K as of December 31, 2008.

  ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS        

        You should consider carefully the following risks, along with the other information contained in or
incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. Additional risks and uncertainties also may adversely affect our business and operations including those discussed in
Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following events
actually occur, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.  

 Risks Associated with our Disclosure Controls and Internal Control over Financial Reporting  

 We recently completed the remediation of our material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. However, our disclosure controls and procedures may not be
effective in future periods if our judgments prove incorrect or new material weaknesses are identified.  

        For each of the fiscal quarters since December 31, 2004 through September 30, 2008, our management reported material
weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency (within the meaning of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") Auditing Standard
No. 5), or a combination of deficiencies,
that adversely affects a company's ability to initiate, authorize, record, process, or report external financial data reliably in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles such that
there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. As a result of these material weaknesses, our management
concluded that for each of the fiscal quarters since December 31, 2004 through September 30, 2008, we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that financial information that we are required to disclose in our reports under the Exchange Act was
recorded, processed, summarized and reported accurately. 

        To
address these material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, each time we prepared our annual and quarterly reports we performed additional analyses and other
post-closing procedures. These additional procedures were costly, time consuming and required us to dedicate a significant amount of our resources, including the time and attention of our
senior management, toward the correction of these problems. Nevertheless, even with these additional procedures, the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting caused us to
have errors in our financial statements and since 2003 we had to restate our annual financial statements six times to correct these errors. 

        The
material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting also caused us to delay the filing of certain quarterly and annual reports with the SEC to dates that went beyond
the deadline prescribed by the SEC's rules to file such reports. Under SEC rules, failure to timely file these reports prohibited us for a period of twelve months from offering and selling our
securities pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which impaired our ability to access the capital markets through the public sale of registered securities in a
timely manner. The failure to file our annual and quarterly reports with the SEC in a timely fashion also resulted in covenant defaults under our senior secured credit facility and the indenture
governing certain of our outstanding debt securities. Such defaults required us to obtain a waiver from the lenders under the senior secured credit facility; however the default under the indentures
was cured upon the filing of the reports within the permitted grace period. In addition to these problems, the material weaknesses in internal controls, the restatements of our financial statements
and the delay in the filing of our annual and quarterly reports exposed us to other risks including, but not limited to: 



•litigation or an expansion of the SEC's informal inquiry into our restatements or the commencement of formal proceedings
by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require us to incur significant legal expenses and other costs or to pay damages, fines or other penalties; 

54




 

<A
HREF="#bg19101a_main_toc">Table of Contents





•negative publicity;   
•ratings downgrades; or   
•the loss or impairment of investor confidence in the Company. 


        As
of December 31, 2008, our management has reported in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that for the first time in four years all of our previously identified material
weaknesses had been remediated and that our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls were effective. For a discussion of our completed remediation efforts and management
assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls, see Item 9A–Controls and Procedures in this Form 10-K. In making their
assessment about the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures, management had to make certain judgments and it is possible that any
number of their judgments were wrong and that our remediation efforts did not fully and completely cure the previously identified material weaknesses. There is also the possibility that there are
other material weaknesses in our internal control that are unknown to us or that new material weaknesses may develop in the future. The existence of any material weakness in our internal control over
financial reporting would subject us to all of the risks described above. 

        Furthermore,
any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls is subject to risks that those internal controls may become inadequate in future periods because of changes in business
conditions, changes in accounting practice or policy, or that the degree of compliance with the revised policies or procedures deteriorates over time. Management, including our CEO and CFO, does not
expect that our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that
the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered
relative to their costs. 

 Our identification of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting caused us to miss deadlines for certain SEC filings and if further filing delays
occur, they could result in negative attention and/or legal consequences for the Company.  

        Our identification of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting caused us to delay the filing of certain
quarterly and annual reports with the SEC to dates that went beyond the deadline prescribed by the SEC's rules to file such reports. 

        We
did not timely file with the SEC our quarterly and annual reports for the year ended December 31, 2005, our quarterly reports for the second and third quarters of 2006, our
annual report for the year ended December 31, 2006, and our quarterly report for the quarter ended March 31, 2007. Under SEC rules, failure to timely file these reports prohibited us for
a twelve month period from offering and selling our securities pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which impaired our ability to access the capital markets
through the public sale of registered securities in a timely manner. 

        The
failure to file our annual and quarterly reports with the SEC in a timely fashion also resulted in covenant defaults under our senior secured credit facility and the indenture
governing certain of our outstanding debt securities. Such defaults required us to obtain a waiver from the lenders under the senior secured credit facility; however the default under the indentures
was cured upon the filing of the reports within the permitted grace period. 


        If
we identify new material weaknesses, there will continue to be an increased risk that we will be unable to timely file future periodic reports with the SEC and that a related default
under our senior secured credit facility and indentures could occur. In addition, the material weaknesses in internal controls, the restatements of our financial statements, and the delay in the
filing of our annual and

quarterly
reports and any similar problems in the future could have other adverse effects on our business, including, but not limited to: 



•impairing our ability to access the capital markets, including, but not limited to the inability to offer and sell
securities pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3;   
•litigation or an expansion of the SEC's informal inquiry into our restatements or the commencement of formal proceedings
by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require us to incur significant legal expenses and other costs or to pay damages, fines or other penalties;   
•additional covenant defaults, and potential events of default, under our senior secured credit facility and the indentures
governing our outstanding debt securities, resulting from our failure to timely file our financial statements;   
•negative publicity;   
•ratings downgrades; or   
•the loss or impairment of investor confidence in the Company. 


 Risks Related to our High Level of Indebtedness  

 We have a significant amount of debt, a large percentage of which is secured, which could adversely affect our business and the ability to fulfill our obligations.  

        As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately $18.1 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis. All
outstanding borrowings under The AES Corporation's senior secured credit facility, our Second Priority Senior Secured Notes and certain other indebtedness are secured by certain of our assets,
including the pledge of capital stock of many of The AES Corporation's directly-held subsidiaries. Most of the debt of The AES Corporation's subsidiaries is secured by substantially all of
the assets of those subsidiaries. Since we have such a high level of debt, a substantial portion of cash flow from operations must be used to make
payments on this debt. Furthermore, since a significant percentage of our assets are used to secure this debt, this reduces the amount of collateral that is available for future secured debt or credit
support and reduces our flexibility in dealing with these secured assets. This high level of indebtedness and related security could have other important consequences to us and our investors,
including: 



•making it more difficult to satisfy debt service and other obligations;   
•increasing the likelihood of a downgrade of our debt, which can cause future debt payments to increase and consume an even
greater portion of cash flow;   
•increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;   
•reducing the availability of cash flow to fund other corporate purposes and grow our business;   
•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry;  
•placing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged; and  
•limiting, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants relating to such indebtedness, among other things, our
ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise, pay cash dividends or repurchase common stock. 


        The
agreements governing our indebtedness, including the indebtedness of our subsidiaries, limit, but do not prohibit, the incurrence of additional indebtedness. To the extent we become
more leveraged, the risks described above would increase. Further, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Accordingly, our cash flows may not be sufficient to repay
at maturity all

of
the outstanding debt as it becomes due and, in that event, we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms or at all to refinance our debt as it becomes
due. In recent months, these risks have increased as conditions in the global economy, including credit markets worldwide, have deteriorated dramatically. For further discussion of these global
economic conditions and their potential impact on the Company, see Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Credit
Crisis and the Macroeconomic Environment. 


 The AES Corporation is a holding company and its ability to make payments on its outstanding indebtedness, including its public debt securities, is dependent upon the
receipt of funds from its subsidiaries by way of dividends, fees, interest, loans or otherwise.  

        The AES Corporation is a holding company with no material assets, other than the stock of its subsidiaries. All of The AES
Corporation's revenue is generated through its subsidiaries. Accordingly, almost all of The AES Corporation's cash flow is generated by the operating activities of its subsidiaries. Therefore, The AES
Corporation's ability to make payments on its indebtedness and to fund its other obligations is dependent not only on the ability of its subsidiaries to generate cash, but also on the ability of the
subsidiaries to distribute cash to it in the form of dividends, fees, interest, loans or otherwise. 

        However,
our subsidiaries face various restrictions in their ability to distribute cash to The AES Corporation. Most of the subsidiaries are obligated, pursuant to loan agreements,
indentures or project financing arrangements, to satisfy certain restricted payment covenants or other conditions before they may make distributions to The AES Corporation. In addition, the payment of
dividends or the making of loans, advances or other payments to The AES Corporation may be subject to legal or regulatory restrictions. Business performance and local accounting and tax rules may
limit the amount of retained earnings that may be distributed to us as a dividend. Subsidiaries in foreign countries may also be prevented from distributing funds to The AES Corporation as a result of
foreign governments restricting the repatriation of funds or the conversion of currencies. Any right that The AES Corporation has to receive any assets of any of its subsidiaries upon any liquidation,
dissolution, winding up, receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings (and the consequent right of the holders of The AES Corporation's indebtedness to participate in
the distribution of, or to realize proceeds from, those assets) will be effectively subordinated to the claims of any such subsidiary's creditors (including trade creditors and holders of debt issued
by such subsidiary). 

        The
AES Corporation could receive less funds than it expects as a result of the current challenges facing the global economy, which could impact the performance of our businesses and
their ability to distribute cash to The AES Corporation. For further discussion of the macroeconomic environment and its impact on our business, see Item 7—Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Credit Crisis and the Macroeconomic Environment. 

        The
AES Corporation's subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and, unless they have expressly guaranteed any of The AES Corporation's indebtedness, have no obligation,
contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to such debt or to make any funds available whether by dividends, fees, loans or other payments. While some of The AES Corporation's
subsidiaries guarantee its indebtedness under its Senior Secured Credit Facility and certain other indebtedness, none of its subsidiaries guarantee, or are otherwise obligated with respect to, its
outstanding public debt securities. 

 Even though The AES Corporation is a holding company, existing and potential future defaults by subsidiaries or affiliates could adversely affect The AES Corporation.  

        We attempt to finance our domestic and foreign projects primarily under loan agreements and related documents which, except as noted
below, require the loans to be repaid solely from the project's revenues and provide that the repayment of the loans (and interest thereon) is secured solely 

57




 

<A
HREF="#bg19101a_main_toc">Table of Contents



by
the capital stock, physical assets, contracts and cash flow of that project subsidiary or affiliate. This type of financing is usually referred to as non-recourse debt or "project
financing." In some project financings, The AES Corporation has explicitly agreed to undertake certain limited obligations and contingent liabilities, most of which by their terms will only be
effective or will be terminated upon the occurrence of future events. These obligations and liabilities take the form of guarantees, indemnities, letter of credit reimbursement agreements and
agreements to pay, in certain circumstances, the project lenders or other parties. 

        As
of December 31, 2008, we had approximately $18.1 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis, of which approximately $5.2 billion was recourse
debt of The AES Corporation and approximately $12.9 billion was non-recourse debt. In addition, we have outstanding guarantees, letters of credit, and other credit support
commitments which are further described in this Form 10-K in Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Capital Resources and Liquidity—Parent Company Liquidity. 


        Some
of our subsidiaries are currently in default with respect to all or a portion of their outstanding indebtedness. The total debt classified as current in our consolidated balance
sheets related to such defaults was $129 million at December 31, 2008. While the lenders under our non-recourse project financings generally do not have direct recourse to
The AES Corporation (other than to the extent of any credit support given by The AES Corporation), defaults there under can still have important consequences for The AES Corporation, including,
without limitation: 



•reducing The AES Corporation's receipt of subsidiary dividends, fees, interest payments, loans and other sources of cash
since the project subsidiary will typically be prohibited from distributing cash to The AES Corporation during the pendency of any default;   
•triggering The AES Corporation's obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee, letter of credit or other
credit support which The AES Corporation has provided to or on behalf of such subsidiary;   
•causing The AES Corporation to record a loss in the event the lender forecloses on the assets;   
•triggering defaults in The AES Corporation's outstanding debt and trust preferred securities. For example, The AES
Corporation's senior secured credit facility and outstanding senior notes include events of default for certain bankruptcy related events involving material subsidiaries. In addition, The AES
Corporation's senior secured credit facility includes certain events of default relating to accelerations of outstanding debt of material subsidiaries; or   
•the loss or impairment of investor confidence in the Company. 


        None
of the projects that are currently in default are owned by subsidiaries that meet the applicable definition of materiality in The AES Corporation's senior secured credit facility in
order for such defaults to trigger an event of default or permit acceleration under such indebtedness. However, as a result of future write-down of assets, dispositions and other matters
that affect our financial position and results of operations, it is possible that one or more of these subsidiaries could fall within the definition of a "material subsidiary" and thereby upon an
acceleration of such
subsidiary's debt, trigger an event of default and possible acceleration of the indebtedness under The AES Corporation's senior secured credit facility. The risk of such defaults may have increased as
a result of the deteriorating global economy. For further discussion of these conditions, see Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Credit Crisis and the Macroeconomic Environment.

 Risks Associated with our Ability to Raise Needed Capital  

 The AES Corporation has significant cash requirements and limited sources of liquidity.  

        The AES Corporation requires cash primarily to fund: 



•principal repayments of debt;   
•interest and preferred dividends;   
•acquisitions;   
•construction and other project commitments;   
•other equity commitments, including business development investments;   
•taxes; and   
•Parent Company overhead costs. 


        The
AES Corporation's principal sources of liquidity are: 



•dividends and other distributions from its subsidiaries;   
•proceeds from debt and equity financings at the Parent Company level; and   
•proceeds from asset sales. 


        For
a more detailed discussion of The AES Corporation's cash requirements and sources of liquidity, please see Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations—Capital Resources and Liquidity in this 2008 Form 10-K. 

        While
we believe that these sources will be adequate to meet our obligations at the Parent Company level for the foreseeable future, this belief is based on a number of material
assumptions, including, without limitation, assumptions about our ability to access the capital or commercial lending markets, the operating and financial performance of our subsidiaries, exchange
rates, our ability to sell assets, and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. Any number of assumptions could prove to be incorrect and therefore there can be no assurance that these
sources will be available when needed or that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than expected. For example, in the current credit crisis, certain financial institutions have gone
bankrupt. In the event that a bank who is party to our credit agreement or other facilities goes bankrupt or is otherwise unable to fund its commitments, we would need to replace that bank in our
syndicate or risk a reduction in the size of the facility, which would reduce our liquidity. In addition, our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay at maturity the entire principal outstanding
under our credit facilities and our debt securities and we may have to refinance such obligations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such refinancing and any of these
events could have a material effect on us. For further discussion of these global economic conditions and their potential impact on the Company, see Item 7—Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Credit Crisis and the Macroeconomic Environment. 

 Our ability to grow our business could be materially adversely affected if we were unable to raise capital on favorable terms.  

        From time to time, we rely on access to capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating
cash flows. Our ability to arrange for financing on either a recourse or non-recourse basis and the costs of such capital are dependent on numerous factors, some of which are beyond our
control, including: 



•general economic and capital market conditions; 

59




 

<A
HREF="#bg19101a_main_toc">Table of Contents





•the availability of bank credit;   
•investor confidence;   
•the financial condition, performance and prospects of The AES Corporation in general and/or that of any subsidiary
requiring the financing; and   
•changes in tax and securities laws which are conducive to raising capital. 


        Since
2007, credit conditions and credit markets have weakened considerably and deteriorated dramatically in 2008, which has made it difficult for many companies to arrange for financing
on a recourse or non-recourse basis. For further discussion of these global economic conditions and their potential impact on the Company, see Item 7—Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation—Credit Crisis and the Macroeconomic Environment. Should future access to capital not be available to us, we may have
to sell assets or decide not to build new plants or expand or improve existing facilities, either of which would affect our future growth. 


 A downgrade in the credit ratings of The AES Corporation or its subsidiaries could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets which could increase our
interest costs or adversely affect our liquidity and cash flow.  

        If any of the credit ratings of The AES Corporation or its subsidiaries were to be downgraded, our ability to raise capital on
favorable terms could be impaired and our borrowing costs would increase. Furthermore, depending on The AES Corporation's credit ratings and the trading prices of its equity and debt securities,
counterparties may no longer be as willing to accept general unsecured commitments by The AES Corporation to provide credit support. Accordingly, with respect to both new and existing commitments, The
AES Corporation may be required to provide some other form of assurance, such as a letter of credit, to backstop or replace any credit support by The AES Corporation. There can be no assurance that
such counterparties will accept such guarantees in the future. In addition, to the extent The AES Corporation is required and able to provide letters of
credit or other collateral to such counterparties, it will limit the amount of credit available to The AES Corporation to meet its other liquidity needs. 

 We may not be able to raise sufficient capital to fund "greenfield" projects in certain less developed economies which could change or in some cases adversely affect our
growth strategy.  

        Part of our strategy is to grow our business by developing Generation and Utility businesses in less developed economies where the
return on our investment may be greater than projects in more developed economies. Commercial lending institutions sometimes refuse to provide non-recourse project financing in certain
less developed economies, and in these situations we have sought and will continue to seek direct or indirect (through credit support or guarantees) project financing from a limited number of
multilateral or bilateral international financial institutions or agencies. As a precondition to making such project financing available, the lending institutions may also require governmental
guarantees of certain project and sovereign related risks. There can be no assurance, however, that project financing from the international financial agencies or that governmental guarantees will be
available when needed, and if they are not, we may have to abandon the project or invest more of our own funds which may not be in line with our investment objectives and would leave less funds for
other projects. These risks have increased as a result of the recent credit crisis and the deteriorating global economy. For further discussion of these global economic conditions and their potential
impact on the Company, see Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Credit Crisis and the Macroeconomic Environment.

 External Risks Associated with Revenue and Earnings Volatility  

 Our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates experienced at our foreign operations.  


        Our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of
the Consolidated Financial Statements, as
well as from transaction exposure associated with transactions in currencies other than an entity's functional currency. While the Consolidated Financial Statements are reported in U.S. Dollars, the
financial statements of many of our subsidiaries outside the United States are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into U.S. Dollars by applying appropriate
exchange rates. As a result, fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar relative to the local currencies where our subsidiaries outside the United States report could cause significant
fluctuations in our results. In addition, while our expenses with respect to foreign operations are generally denominated in the same currency as corresponding sales, we have transaction exposure to
the extent receipts and expenditures are not denominated in the subsidiary's functional currency. 

        We
also experience foreign transaction exposure to the extent monetary assets and liabilities, including debt, are in a different currency than the subsidiary's functional currency.
Moreover, the costs of doing business abroad may increase as a result of adverse exchange rate fluctuations. Our financial position and results of operations have been significantly affected by
fluctuations in the value of a number of currencies, primarily the Brazilian real, Argentine peso, Chilean peso, Colombian peso and Philippine peso. As our Brazilian and Argentine businesses primarily
identify their local currency as their functional currency, recent depreciation of these currencies has resulted in the increase of deferred translation losses (foreign currency translation
adjustments recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss) based on positive net asset positions. Devaluation has also resulted in foreign currency transaction losses primarily associated with
U.S. Dollar debt at these businesses. 

 Our businesses may incur substantial costs and liabilities and be exposed to price volatility as a result of risks associated with the wholesale electricity markets, which
could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.  

        Some of our Generation businesses sell electricity in the wholesale spot markets in cases where they operate wholly or partially
without long-term power sales agreements. Our Utility businesses and, to the extent they require additional capacity, our Generation businesses, also buy electricity in the wholesale spot
markets. As a result, we are exposed to the risks of rising and falling prices in those markets. The open market wholesale prices for electricity are very volatile and often reflect the fluctuating
cost of coal, natural gas, or oil. Consequently, any changes in the supply and cost of coal, natural gas, and oil may impact the open market wholesale price of electricity. 

        Volatility
in market prices for fuel and electricity may result from among other things: 



•plant availability;   
•competition;   
•demand for energy commodities;   
•electricity usage;   
•seasonality;   
•interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuation;   
•availability and price of emission credits;   
•input prices; 

61




 

<A
HREF="#bg19101a_main_toc">Table of Contents





•hydrology and other weather conditions;   
•illiquid markets;   
•transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies;   
•availability of competitively priced renewables sources;   
•available supplies of natural gas, crude oil and refined products, and coal;   
•generating unit performance;   
•natural disasters, terrorism, wars, embargoes and other catastrophic events;   
•energy, market and environmental regulation, legislation and policies;   
•geopolitical concerns affecting global supply of oil and natural gas; and   
•general economic conditions in areas where we operate which impact energy consumption. 


        The
Company has faced gas curtailments in the past. For example, gas supply in the Argentine market is increasingly scarce and exports have been both taxed and curtailed. Gas supply
curtailments can be exacerbated during the Argentine winter (May through September) when domestic demand for electricity experiences a seasonal increase. Since substantially all of the gas used in the
Chilean power
sector is currently imported from Argentina, gas curtailments can impact our Chilean operations through higher fuel costs and higher costs of purchased energy from the spot market. Our natural
gas-fired plant in Southern Brazil, Uruguaiana, has also been impacted by limited fuel supply. Since 2004, Uruguaiana has had its gas supply interrupted from May to September. During this
period, Uruguaiana purchases energy from the spot market and through bilateral contracts to fulfill its sales contracts and has paid higher fuel prices as a result. During the fourth quarter of 2007,
the combination of gas curtailments and increases in the spot market price of energy triggered an impairment analysis of Uruguaiana's long-lived assets for recoverability. As a result of
this impairment analysis, aggregate pre-tax impairment charges of $388 million were recognized in 2008 and 2007 which represents a full impairment of the fixed assets. 

        In
addition, our business depends upon transmission facilities owned and operated by others. If transmission is disrupted or capacity is inadequate or unavailable, our ability to sell
and deliver power may be limited, which may have a material adverse impact on our business. 

 We may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates.  

        We routinely enter into contracts to hedge a portion of our purchase and sale commitments for electricity, fuel requirements and other
commodities to lower our financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations. As part of this strategy, we routinely utilize fixed-price forward physical purchase and sales contracts, futures,
financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. We also enter into contracts which help us to hedge our interest rate exposure on
variable debt. However, we may not cover the entire exposure of our assets or positions to market price (or interest rate) volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. Furthermore, the risk
management procedures we have in place may not always be followed or may not work as planned. In particular, if prices of commodities (or interest rates) significantly deviate from historical prices
or if the price volatility (or interest rates) or distribution of these changes deviates from historical norms, our risk management system may not protect us from significant losses. As a result,
fluctuating commodity prices may negatively impact our financial results to the extent we have unhedged or inadequately hedged positions. In addition, certain types of economic hedging activities may
not qualify for hedge accounting under GAAP, resulting in increased volatility in our net income. In addition, there is a risk that the current parties to these arrangements may fail or are unable to
perform their obligations under these arrangements. 

62




 

<A
HREF="#bg19101a_main_toc">Table of Contents



 Supplier and/or customer concentration may expose the Company to significant financial credit or performance risks.  

        We often rely on a single contracted supplier or a small number of suppliers for the provision of fuel, transportation of fuel and
other services required for the operation of certain of our facilities. If these suppliers cannot perform, we would seek to meet our fuel requirements by purchasing fuel at market prices, exposing us
to market price volatility and the risk that fuel and transportation may not be available during certain periods at any price. 


        At
times, we rely on a single customer or a few customers to purchase all or a significant portion of a facility's output, in some cases under long-term agreements that
account for a substantial percentage of the anticipated revenue from a given facility. We have also hedged a portion of our exposure to power price fluctuations through forward fixed price power
sales. Counterparties to these agreements may breach or may be unable to perform their obligations. We may not be able to enter into replacement agreements on terms as favorable as our existing
agreements, or at all. If we were unable to enter into replacement PPAs, we would sell our plants' power at market prices. 


        The
failure of any supplier or customer to fulfill its contractual obligations to The AES Corporation or our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
Consequently, the financial performance of our facilities is dependent on the credit quality of, and continued performance by, suppliers and customers. 

 Certain of our businesses are sensitive to variations in weather.  

        Our businesses are affected by variations in general weather conditions and unusually severe weather. Our businesses forecast electric
sales on the basis of normal weather, which represents a long-term historical average. While we also consider possible variations in normal weather patterns and potential impacts on our
facilities and our businesses, there can be no assurance that such planning can prevent these impacts, which can adversely affect our business. Generally, demand for electricity peaks in winter and
summer. Typically, when winters are warmer than expected and summers are cooler than expected, demand for energy is lower, resulting in less demand for electricity than forecasted. Significant
variations from normal weather where our businesses are located could have a material impact on our results of operations. 

        In
addition, we are dependent upon hydrological conditions prevailing from time to time in the broad geographic regions in which our hydroelectric generation facilities are located. If
hydrological conditions result in droughts or other conditions that negatively affect our hydroelectric generation business, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In the
past, our businesses in Latin America have been negatively impacted by lower than normal rainfall. 

 Risks Associated with our Operations  

 We do a significant amount of business outside the United States, including in developing countries, which presents significant risks.  

        A significant amount of our revenue is generated outside the United States and a significant portion of our international operations is
conducted in developing countries. Part of our growth strategy is to expand our business in developing countries because the growth rates and the opportunity to implement operating improvements and
achieve higher operating margins may be greater than those typically achievable in more developed countries. International operations, particularly the operation, financing and development of projects
in developing countries, entail significant risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation: 



•economic, social and political instability in any particular country or region;   
•adverse changes in currency exchange rates; 

63




 

<A
HREF="#bg19101a_main_toc">Table of Contents





•government restrictions on converting currencies or repatriating funds;   
•unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulations or in trade, monetary or fiscal policies;   
•high inflation and monetary fluctuations;   
•restrictions on imports of coal, oil, gas or other raw materials required by our generation businesses to operate;  
•threatened or consummated expropriation or nationalization of our assets by foreign governments;  
•difficulties in hiring, training and retaining qualified personnel, particularly finance and accounting personnel with
U.S. GAAP expertise;   
•unwillingness of governments, government agencies, similar organizations or other counterparties to honor their contracts;  
•unwillingness of governments, government agencies, courts or similar bodies to enforce contracts that are economically
advantageous to subsidiaries of the Company and economically unfavorable to counterparties, against such counterparties, whether such counterparties are governments or private parties;  
•inability to obtain access to fair and equitable political, regulatory, administrative and legal systems;  
•adverse changes in government tax policy;   
•difficulties in enforcing our contractual rights or enforcing judgments or obtaining a just result in local jurisdictions;
and   
•potentially adverse tax consequences of operating in multiple jurisdictions. 


        Any
of these factors, by itself or in combination with others, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, in the
second quarter of 2007, we sold our stake in EDC to Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. ("PDVSA"), the state owned energy company in Venezuela after Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
threatened to expropriate the electricity business in Venezuela. In connection with the sale, we recognized an impairment charge of approximately $680 million. In addition, our Latin American
operations experience volatility in revenues and gross margin which have caused and are expected to cause significant volatility in our results of operations and cash flows. The volatility is caused
by regulatory and economic difficulties, political instability and currency devaluations being experienced in many of these countries. This volatility reduces the predictability and enhances the
uncertainty associated with cash flows from these businesses. 

 The operation of power generation and distribution facilities involves significant risks that could adversely affect our financial results.  


        The operation of power generation and distribution facilities involves many risks, including: 



•equipment failure causing unplanned outages;   
•failure of transmission systems;   
•the dependence on a specified fuel source, including the transportation of fuel;   
•catastrophic events such as fires, explosions, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes and similar occurrences; and  
•environmental compliance. 

64




 

<A
HREF="#bg19101a_main_toc">Table of Contents






        Any
of these risks could have an adverse effect on our generation and distribution facilities. In addition, a portion of our generation facilities were constructed many years ago. Older
generating equipment may require significant capital expenditures for maintenance. This equipment is also likely to require periodic upgrading and improvement. Breakdown or failure of one of our
operating facilities may prevent the facility from performing under applicable power sales agreements which, in certain situations, could result in termination of a power purchase or other agreement
or incurring a liability for liquidated damages. 

        As
a result of the above risks and other potential hazards associated with the power generation and distribution industries, we may from time to time become exposed to significant
liabilities for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage. Power generation involves hazardous activities, including acquiring, transporting and unloading fuel, operating large pieces of
rotating equipment and delivering electricity to transmission and distribution systems. In addition to natural risks, such as earthquakes, floods, lightning, hurricanes and wind, hazards, such as
fire, explosion, collapse and machinery failure, are inherent risks in our operations which may occur as a result of inadequate internal processes, technological flaws, human error or certain external
events. The control and management of these risks depend upon adequate development and training of personnel and on the existence of operational procedures, preventative maintenance plans and specific
programs supported by quality control systems which reduce, but do not eliminate the possibility of the occurrence and impact of these risks. 

        The
hazards described above can cause significant personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment, contamination of, or damage to, the
environment and suspension of operations. The occurrence of any one of these events may result in us being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages, environmental
cleanup costs, personal injury and fines and/or penalties. We maintain an amount of insurance protection that we believe is adequate, but there can be no assurance that our insurance will be
sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject. A successful claim for which we are not fully insured could hurt our financial
results and materially harm our financial condition. Further, due to rising insurance costs and changes in the insurance markets, we cannot provide assurance that insurance coverage will continue to
be available on terms similar to those presently available to us or at all. Any losses not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations
or cash flows. 

 Our ability to attract and retain skilled people could have a material adverse effect on our operations.  

        Our operating success and ability to carry out growth initiatives depends in part on our ability to retain executives and to attract
and retain additional qualified personnel who have experience in our industry and in operating a company of our size and complexity, including people in our foreign businesses. The inability to
attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, because of the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacements. In particular, we routinely are
required to assess the financial and tax impacts of complicated business transactions which occur on a worldwide basis. These assessments are dependent on hiring personnel on a worldwide basis with
sufficient expertise in U.S. GAAP to timely and accurately comply with U.S. reporting obligations. An inability to maintain adequate internal accounting and managerial controls and hire and
retain qualified personnel could have an adverse affect on our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations.

 We have contractual obligations to certain customers to provide full requirements service, which makes it difficult to predict and plan for load requirements and may result
in increased operating costs to certain of our businesses.  

        We have contractual obligations to certain customers to supply power to satisfy all or a portion of their energy requirements. The
uncertainty regarding the amount of power that our power generation and distribution facilities must be prepared to supply to customers may increase our operating costs. A significant under or
over-estimation of load requirements could result in our facilities not having enough or having too much power to cover their obligations, in which case we would be required to buy or sell
power from or to third parties at prevailing market prices. Those prices may not be favorable and thus could increase our operating costs. 

 We may not be able to enter into long-term contracts, which reduce volatility in our results of operations. Even when we successfully enter into
long-term contracts, our generation businesses are dependent on one or a limited number of customers and a limited number of fuel suppliers.  

        Many of our generation plants conduct business under long-term contracts. In these instances, we rely on power sales
contracts with one or a limited number of customers for the majority of, and in some case all of, the relevant plant's output and revenues over the term of the power sales contract. The remaining
terms of the power sales contracts range from 1 to 25 years. In many cases, we also limit our exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices by entering into long-term contracts for fuel
with a limited number of suppliers. In these instances, the cash flows and results of operations are dependent on the continued ability of customers and suppliers to meet their obligations under the
relevant power sales contract or fuel supply contract, respectively. Some of our long-term power sales agreements are at prices above current spot market prices and some of our
long-term fuel supply contracts are at prices below current market prices. The loss of significant power sales contracts or fuel supply contracts, or the failure by any of the parties to
such contracts that prevents us from fulfilling our obligations thereunder, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, depending
on market conditions and regulatory regimes, it may be difficult for us to secure long-term contracts, either where our current contracts are expiring or for new development projects. The
inability to enter into long-term contracts could require many of our businesses to purchase inputs at market prices and sell electricity into spot markets. Because of the volatile nature
of inputs and power prices, the inability to secure long-term contracts could generate increased volatility in our earnings and cash flows and could generate substantial losses during
certain periods which could have a material impact on our business and results of operations. 


        We
have sought to reduce counter party credit risk under our long-term contracts in part by entering into power sales contracts with utilities or other customers of strong
credit quality and by obtaining guarantees from the sovereign government of the customer's obligations. However, many of our customers do not have, or have failed to maintain, an investment grade
credit rating, and our Generation business can not always obtain government guarantees and if they do, the government does not always have an investment grade credit rating. We have also sought to
reduce our credit risk by locating our plants in different geographic areas in order to mitigate the effects of regional economic downturns. However, there can be no assurance that our efforts to
mitigate this risk will be successful. These risks have increased as a result of the deteriorating global economy. For further discussion of these global economic conditions and their potential impact
on the Company, see Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Credit Crisis and the Macroeconomic Environment. 

 Competition is increasing and could adversely affect us.  

        The power production markets in which we operate are characterized by numerous strong and capable competitors, many of whom may have
extensive and diversified developmental or operating

experience
(including both domestic and international) and financial resources similar to or greater than ours. Further, in recent years, the power production industry has been characterized by strong
and increasing competition with respect to both obtaining power sales agreements and acquiring existing power generation assets. In certain markets, these factors have caused reductions in prices
contained in new power sales agreements and, in many cases, have caused higher acquisition prices for existing assets through competitive bidding practices. The evolution of competitive electricity
markets and the development of highly efficient gas-fired power plants have also caused, or are anticipated to cause, price pressure in certain power markets where we sell or intend to
sell power. These competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on us. 

 Our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in our operating performance or cost structure.  

        We are in the business of generating and distributing electricity, which involves certain risks that can adversely affect financial and
operating performance, including: 



•changes in the availability of our generation facilities or distribution systems due to increases in scheduled and
unscheduled plant outages, equipment failure, labor disputes, disruptions in fuel supply, inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements or catastrophic events such as fires, floods,
storms, hurricanes, earthquakes, explosions, terrorist acts or other similar occurrences; and   
•changes in our operating cost structure including, but not limited to, increases in costs relating to: gas, coal, oil and
other fuel; fuel transportation; purchased electricity; operations, maintenance and repair; environmental compliance, including the cost of purchasing emissions offsets and capital expenditures to
install environmental emission equipment; transmission access; and insurance. 


        Any
of the above risks could adversely affect our business and results of operations, and our ability to meet publicly announced projections or analysts' expectations. 

 Some of our subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans and their net pension plan obligations may require additional significant contributions.  


        Certain of our subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of their respective employees. Of the twenty
four defined benefit plans, three are at U.S. subsidiaries and the remaining plans are at foreign subsidiaries. Pension costs are based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected
long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, the expected life span of pension plan beneficiaries and the discount rate used to determine the present value of future pension
obligations. Any of these assumptions could prove to be wrong, resulting in a shortfall of pension plan assets compared to pension obligations under the pension plan. The Company periodically
evaluates the value of the pension plan assets to ensure that they will be sufficient to fund the respective pension obligations. The Company's exposure is mitigated due to the fact that the asset
allocations in our largest plans are more heavily weighted to investments in fixed income securities that have not been as severely impacted by the recent equity market declines. Nevertheless, given
the recent significant declines in financial markets, the value of these pension plan assets has declined and our future pension expense and funding obligations have increased. In addition, future
downturns in the equity markets, or the failure of any of our assumptions underlying the estimates of our subsidiaries' pension plan obligations, could result in an increase in pension expense and
funding requirements in future periods, which may be material. Our subsidiaries who participate in these plans are responsible for funding any shortfall of pension plan assets compared to pension
obligations under the pension plan. This may necessitate additional cash contributions to the pension plans that could adversely affect our and our subsidiaries' liquidity.

        For
additional information regarding the funding position of the Company's pension plans, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Critical Accounting Estimates—Pension and Postretirement Obligations" and Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on
Form 10-K. 

 Our business is subject to substantial development uncertainties.  

        Certain of our subsidiaries and affiliates are in various stages of developing and constructing "greenfield" power plants, some but not
all of which have signed long-term contracts or made similar arrangements for the sale of electricity. Successful completion depends upon overcoming substantial risks, including, but not
limited to, risks relating to failures of siting, financing, construction, permitting, governmental approvals or the potential for termination of the power sales contract as a result of a failure to
meet certain milestones. Financing risk has also increased as a result of the deterioration of the global economy and the crisis in the financial markets, and as a result, we may forgo certain
development opportunities. We believe that capitalized costs for projects under development are recoverable; however, there can be no assurance that any individual project will be completed and reach
commercial operation. If these development efforts are not successful, we may abandon a project under development and write off the costs incurred in connection with such project. At the time of
abandonment, we would expense all capitalized development costs incurred in connection therewith and could incur additional losses associated with any related contingent liabilities. 


 Our acquisitions may not perform as expected.  

        Historically, acquisitions have been a significant part of our growth strategy. We may continue to grow our business through
acquisitions. Although acquired businesses may have significant operating histories, we will have a limited or no history of owning and operating many of these businesses and possibly limited or no
experience operating in the country or region where these businesses are located. Some of these businesses may be government owned and some may be operated as part of a larger integrated utility prior
to their acquisition. If we were to acquire any of these types of businesses, there can be no assurance that: 



•we will be successful in transitioning them to private ownership;   
•such businesses will perform as expected;   
•we will not incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities;   
•such business will generate sufficient cash flow to support the indebtedness incurred to acquire them or the capital
expenditures needed to develop them; or   
•the rate of return from such businesses will justify our decision to invest our capital to acquire them. 


        In
April 2008, the Company completed the purchase of a 92% interest in a 660 gross MW coal-fired thermal power generation facility in Masinloc, Philippines
("Masinloc") from the Power Sector Assets & Liabilities Management Corporation, a state enterprise, for $930 million in cash. Immediately after the acquisition, the Company embarked upon
a comprehensive rehabilitation program to improve the output, reliability and general condition of the plant. As a result, operating losses have been reduced and the business is expected to generate a
profit in 2009. However, in the event that the progress made does not continue, or Masinloc performs worse than expected, the Company could incur further operating losses which could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations. Further losses could also trigger an impairment of the assets held by Masinloc.

 In some of our joint venture projects, we have granted protective rights to minority holders or we own less than a majority of the equity in the project and do not manage or
otherwise control the project, which entails certain risks.  

        We have invested in some joint ventures where we own less than a majority of the voting equity in the venture. Very often, we seek to
exert a degree of influence with respect to the management and operation of projects in which we have less than a majority of the ownership interests by operating the project pursuant to a management
contract, negotiating to obtain positions on management committees or to receive certain limited governance rights, such as rights to veto significant actions. However, we do not always have this type
of control over the project in every instance; and we may be dependent on our co-venturers to operate such projects. Our co-venturers may not have the level of experience,
technical expertise, human resources, management and other attributes necessary to operate these projects optimally. The approval of co-venturers also may be required for us to receive
distributions of funds from projects or to transfer our interest in projects. 

        In
some joint venture agreements where we do have majority control of the voting securities, we have entered into shareholder agreements granting protective minority rights to the other
shareholders. For example, Brasiliana Energia ("Brasiliana") is a holding company in which we have a controlling equity interest and through which we own three of our four Brazilian businesses:
Eletropaulo, Tietê and Uruguaiana. We entered into a shareholders' agreement with an affiliate of the Brazilian National Development Bank ("BNDES") which owns more than
49 percent of the voting equity of Brasiliana. Among other things, the shareholders' agreement requires the consent of both parties before taking certain corporate actions, grants both parties
rights of first refusal in connection with the sale of interests in Brasiliana and grants drag-along rights to BNDES. In May, 2007, BNDES notified us that it intends to sell all of its
interest in Brasiliana pursuant to public auction (the "Brasiliana Sale"). BNDES also informed us that if we fail to exercise our right of first refusal to purchase all of its interest in Brasiliana,
then BNDES intends to exercise its drag-along rights under the shareholders' agreement and cause us to sell all of our interests in Brasiliana in the Brasiliana Sale as well. After the
auction, if a third party offer has been received in the Brasiliana Sale, we will have 30 days to exercise our right of first refusal to purchase all of BNDES's interest in Brasiliana on the
same terms as the third- party offer. If we do not exercise this right and BNDES proceeds to exercise its drag-along rights, then we may be forced to sell all of our interest in
Brasiliana. Due to the uncertainty in the sale price at this point in time, we are uncertain whether we will exercise our right of first refusal should BNDES receive a valid third-party offer in the
Brasiliana Sale and, if we do, whether we would do it alone or with joint venture partners. Even if we desire to exercise our right of first refusal, we cannot assure that we will have the cash on
hand or that debt or equity financing will be available at acceptable terms in order to purchase BNDES's interest in Brasiliana. If we do not exercise our right of first refusal, we cannot be assured
that we will not have to record a loss if the sale price is below the book value of our investment in Brasiliana. 

 Our renewable energy projects and other initiatives face considerable uncertainties including, development, operational and regulatory challenges.  

        AES Wind Generation, AES Solar, our projects in climate solutions and our investments in projects such as energy storage are subject to
substantial risks. Projects of this nature are relatively new, are supported financially by favorable regulatory incentives and have been developed through advancement in technologies which may not be
proven, or which are unrelated to our core business. 

        As
a result, these projects face considerable risk, including the risk that favorable regulatory regimes expire or are adversely modified. In addition, because these projects depend on
technology outside of our expertise in Generation and Utilities, there are risks associated with our ability to develop and manage such projects profitably. Furthermore, at the development or
acquisition stage, because of the nascent nature of these industries, our ability to predict actual performance results may be hindered and the projects may not perform as predicted. There are also
risks associated with the 

69




 

<A
HREF="#bg19101a_main_toc">Table of Contents



fact
that many of these projects exist in new or emerging markets, where long-term fixed price contracts for the major cost and revenue components may be unavailable, which in turn may
result in these projects having relatively high levels of volatility. 


        These
projects can be capital-intensive and generally require that we obtain third party financing, which may be difficult to obtain. As a result, these capital constraints may reduce
our ability to develop these projects. These risks may be exacerbated by the current global economic crisis, including our management's increased focus on liquidity, which may also result in slower
growth in the number of projects we can pursue. The economic downturn could also impact the value of our assets in these countries and our ability to develop these projects. If the value of these
assets decline, this could result in a material impairment or a series of impairments which are material in the aggregate, which would adversely affect our financial statements. 


 The global credit crisis could impact our growth plans and the values of our assets.  

        In the second half of 2007, conditions in the credit markets began to deteriorate in the United States and abroad. In the third and
fourth quarter of 2008, this crisis and associated market conditions worsened dramatically, with unprecedented market volatility, widening credit spreads, volatile currencies, illiquidity, and
increased counterparty credit risk. As a result of the deterioration in the global economy, the Company has placed a greater emphasis on preservation of liquidity. The Company currently intends to
complete the projects it has under construction, those that have obtained financing and a select group of projects which may be able to obtain financing in these challenging financial markets. In the
event that management determines that, because of macroeconomic challenges or other factors, certain of these or other projects in the pipeline cannot be financed, will not provide the returns
originally anticipated, or are otherwise unfeasible, or that other uses of capital such as debt repayment or stock repurchases offer a better return on the Company's capital, or that the funds should
be used for working capital, the Company may determine that it will not pursue certain projects in its pipeline, which will affect our growth. 

        In
addition, the global recession could impact the value of our assets around the world. For example, in 2008, we impaired certain projects in our pipeline, resulting in a charge to 2008
earnings. Further declines in asset values could result in additional write-downs, which could be material to our financial statements. 

 An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill would negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth.  

        Goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or more
frequently if impairment indicators are present. In assessing the recoverability of goodwill, we make estimates and assumptions about sales, operating margin growth rates and discount rates based on
our budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management's judgment in applying
these factors. The fair value of a reporting unit has been determined using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. We could be required to evaluate
the recoverability of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience situations, including but not limited to, disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating
results, divestiture of a significant component of our business or sustained market capitalization declines. There could also be impairments if our acquisitions do not perform as expected. See further
discussion in Risk Factor, "Our Acquisitions May Not Perform as Expected." These types of events and the resulting analyses could result in goodwill
impairment charges in the future. Impairment charges could substantially affect our financial results in the periods of such charges. As of December 31, 2008, we had $1.4 billion of
goodwill, which represented approximately 4.1% of total assets. If current conditions in the global economy continue or worsen, this could increase the risk that we will have to impair goodwill.

 Risks associated with Governmental Regulation and Laws  

 Our operations are subject to significant government regulation and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the law or regulatory
schemes.  

        Our inability to predict, influence or respond appropriately to changes in law or regulatory schemes, including any inability to obtain
expected or contracted increases in electricity tariff rates or tariff adjustments for increased expenses, could adversely impact our results of operations or our ability to meet publicly announced
projections or analyst's expectations. Furthermore,
changes in laws or regulations or changes in the application or interpretation of regulatory provisions in jurisdictions where we operate, particularly our Utilities where electricity tariffs are
subject to regulatory review or approval, could adversely affect our business, including, but not limited to: 



•changes in the determination, definition or classification of costs to be included as reimbursable or
pass-through costs, including but not limited to costs incurred to upgrade our power plants to comply with more stringent environmental regulations;   
•changes in the determination of what is an appropriate rate of return on invested capital or a determination that a
utility's operating income or the rates it charges customers is too high, resulting in a reduction of rates or consumer rebates;   
•changes in the definition or determination of controllable or non-controllable costs;  
•changes in the definition of events which may or may not qualify as changes in economic equilibrium;  
•changes in the timing of tariff increases; or   
•other changes in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions. 


        Any
of the above events may result in lower margins for the affected businesses, which can adversely affect our business. 

        For
example, as noted in Item 1—Business—Regulatory Matters—Hungary of this Form 10-K, in June 2008 the European Commission
("the Commission") reached its decision that the PPAs, including AES Tisza's PPA, contain elements of illegal state aid. The decision requires Hungary to terminate the PPAs within six months of the
June 2008 publication of the decision, and to recover the alleged illegal state aid from the generators within ten months of publication. Hungary and the Commission are in the process of resolving
confidentiality matters relating to the wording of the decision, which has not yet been notified by the Commission to the generators. AES Tisza is challenging the Commission's decision in the Court of
First Instance of the European Communities. Referring to the Commission's decision, Hungary adopted act number LXX of 2008 which terminates all long-term PPAs in Hungary, including AES
Tisza's PPA, as of December 31, 2008, and requires generators to repay the alleged illegal state aid that was allegedly received by the generators through the PPAs, and provides for the
possibility to offset stranded costs of the generators from the repayable state aid. It is possible that the Company may face additional regulatory actions of this type and, depending on the outcome,
such actions could have a material adverse impact on the Company. 

        In
addition, in many countries where we conduct business, the regulatory environment is constantly changing or the regulations can be difficult to interpret. As a result, there is risk
that we may not properly interpret certain regulations and may not understand the impact of certain regulations on our business. For example, in October 2006, ANEEL, which regulates our utility
operations at Sul and Eletropaulo in Brazil, issued Normative Resolution 234 requiring that utilities begin amortizing a liability called "Special Obligations" beginning with their second tariff reset
cycle in 2007 or a later year as an offset to depreciation expense. As of May 23, 2007, the date of the filing of our 2006 Form 10-K, no industry positions or any other
consensus had been reached regarding how ANEEL guidance should be applied at that date and accordingly, no adjustments to the financial statements were made relating to Special Obligations in Brazil.
Subsequent to May 23, 2007, industry discussions 

71




 

<A
HREF="#bg19101a_main_toc">Table of Contents



occurred
and other Brazilian companies filed Forms 20-F with the SEC reflecting the impact of Resolution 234 in their December 31, 2006 financial statements differently from
how the Company accounted for Resolution 234. In the absence of any significant regulatory developments between May 23, 2007 and the date of these other filings, the Company determined that
Resolution 234 required us to record an adjustment to our Special Obligations liability as of December 31, 2006. In part, the decision to record the adjustment led to the restatement of our
financial statements in the third quarter of 2007. If we face additional challenges interpreting regulations or changes in regulations, it could have a material adverse impact on our business. 

 Our Generation business in the United States is subject to the provisions of various laws and regulations administered in whole or in part by the FERC, including the Public
Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 ("PURPA") and the Federal Power Act. The recently enacted EPAct 2005 made a number of changes to these and other laws that may affect our business. Actions by
the FERC and by state utility commissions can have a material effect on our operations.  

        EPAct 2005 authorizes the FERC to remove the obligation of electric utilities under Section 210 of PURPA to enter into new
contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity from or to QF's if certain market conditions are met. Pursuant to this authority, the FERC has instituted a rebuttable presumption that utilities
located within the control areas of the Midwest Transmission System Operator, Inc., PJM ("Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland") Interconnection, L.L.C., ISO New England, Inc., the New
York Independent System Operator and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. are not required to purchase or sell power from or to QFs above a certain size. In addition, the FERC is
authorized under the new law to remove the purchase/sale obligations of individual utilities on a case-by-case basis. While the new law does not affect existing contracts, as a
result of the changes to PURPA, our QF's may face a more difficult market environment when their current long-term contracts expire. 

        EPAct
2005 repealed PUHCA 1935 and enacted PUHCA 2005 in its place. PUHCA 1935 had the effect of requiring utility holding companies to operate in geographically proximate regions and
therefore limited the range of potential combinations and mergers among utilities. By comparison, PUHCA 2005 has no such restrictions and simply provides the FERC and state utility commissions with
enhanced access to the books and records of certain utility holding companies. The repeal of PUHCA 1935 removed barriers to mergers and other potential combinations which could result in the creation
of large, geographically dispersed utility holding companies. These entities may have enhanced financial strength and therefore an increased ability to compete with us in the U.S. generation market. 

        In
accordance with Congressional mandates in the EPAct 1992 and now in EPAct 2005, the FERC has strongly encouraged competition in wholesale electric markets. Increased competition may
have the effect of lowering our operating margins. Among other steps, the FERC has encouraged RTOs and ISOs to develop demand response bidding programs as a mechanism for responding to peak electric
demand. These programs may reduce the value of our peaking assets which rely on very high prices during a relatively small number of hours to recover their costs. Similarly, the FERC is encouraging
the construction of new transmission infrastructure in accordance with provisions of EPAct 2005. Although new transmission lines may increase market opportunities, they may also increase the
competition in our existing markets. 

        While
the FERC continues to promote competition, some state utility commissions have reversed course and begun to encourage the construction of generation facilities by traditional
utilities to be paid for on a cost-of-service basis by retail ratepayers. Such actions have the effect of reducing sale opportunities in the competitive wholesale generating
markets in which we operate. 

 Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations.  

        Our activities are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations by many federal, state and local authorities, international
treaties and foreign governmental authorities. These laws and 

72




 


<A
HREF="#bg19101a_main_toc">Table of Contents



regulations
generally concern emissions into the air, effluents into the water, use of water, wetlands preservation, remediation of contamination, waste disposal, endangered species and noise
regulation, among others. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations or to obtain any necessary environmental permits pursuant to such laws and regulations could result in fines or other
sanctions. Environmental laws and regulations affecting power generation and distribution are complex and have tended to become more stringent over time. Congress and other domestic and foreign
governmental authorities have either considered or implemented various laws and regulations to restrict or tax certain emissions, particularly those involving air and water emissions. See the various
descriptions of these laws and regulations contained in Item 1 Business—Regulatory Matters—Environmental and Land Use Regulations of this Form 10-K.
These laws and regulations have imposed, and proposed laws and regulations could impose in the future, additional costs on the operation of our power plants. We have incurred and will continue to
incur significant capital and other expenditures to comply with these and other environmental laws and regulations. Changes in, or new, environmental restrictions may force us to incur significant
expenses or expenses that may exceed our estimates. There can be no assurance that we would be able to recover all or any increased environmental costs from our customers or that our business,
financial condition or results of operations would not be materially and adversely affected by such expenditures or any changes in domestic or foreign environmental laws and regulations. 


 Regulators, politicians, non-governmental organizations and other private parties have expressed concern about greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions and are taking
actions which, in addition to the potential physical risks associated with climate change, could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash
flows.  

        As discussed in Item 1—Business—Regulatory Matters—Environmental and Land Use Regulations,
at the international, federal and various regional and state levels, policies are under development to regulate GHG emissions, thereby effectively putting a cost on such emissions in order to create
financial incentives to reduce them. In 2008, the Company's subsidiaries operated businesses which had total approximate CO2 emissions of 83.8 million metric tonnes (ownership adjusted).
Approximately 41.5 million metric tonnes of the 83.8 million metric tonnes were emitted by businesses located in the United States (both figures ownership adjusted). Federal, state or regional
regulation of GHG emissions could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial performance. The actual impact on the Company's financial performance and the financial performance of the
Company's subsidiaries will depend on a number of factors, including among others, the GHG reductions required under any such legislation or regulations, the price and availability of offsets, the
extent to which market based compliance options are available, the
extent to which our subsidiaries would be entitled to receive GHG emissions allowances without having to purchase them in an auction or on the open market and the impact of such legislation or
regulation on the ability of our subsidiaries to recover costs incurred. As a result of these factors, our cost of compliance could be substantial and could have a material impact on our results of
operations. Another factor is the success of our climate solutions projects, which may generate credits that will help offset our GHG emissions. However, as set forth in the Risk Factor titled
"Our renewable energy projects and other initiatives face considerable uncertainties including development, operational and regulatory challenges,"
there is no guarantee that the climate solutions projects will be successful. Also, the level of potential benefit is unclear given current uncertainties regarding legislation and/or litigation
concerning GHG emissions.

Table of Contents 

        In January 2005, based on European Community "Directive 2003/87/EC on Greenhouse Gas Emission Allowance Trading," the European Union Greenhouse Gas Emission
Trading Scheme ("EU ETS") commenced operation as the largest multi-country GHG emission trading scheme in the world. On February 16, 2005, the Kyoto Protocol became effective. The Kyoto
Protocol requires the 40 developed countries that have ratified it to substantially reduce their GHG emissions, including CO2. To date, compliance with the Kyoto Protocol and the EU ETS
has not had a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 

        The
United States has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol. In the United States, there currently are no federal mandatory GHG emission reduction programs (including CO2)
affecting the electric power generation facilities of the Company's subsidiaries. However, there are several proposed GHG legislative initiatives in the United States Congress that would, if enacted,
constrain GHG emissions, including CO2, and/or impose costs on us that could be material to our business or results of operations. 


        On
April 2, 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in a case involving the regulation under the CAA of CO2 emissions from motor vehicles. The Court ruled
that CO2 is a pollutant which potentially could be subject to regulation under the CAA and that the U.S. EPA has a duty to determine whether CO2 emissions contribute to climate
change or to provide some reasonable explanation why it will not exercise its authority. In response to the Court's decision, on July 11, 2008, the U.S. EPA issued an ANPR to solicit public
input on whether CO2 emissions should be regulated from both mobile and stationary sources under the CAA. The U.S. EPA has not yet made any such
determination. Since electric power generation facilities, particularly coal-fired facilities, are a significant source of CO2 emissions both in the United States and globally,
the Court's decision, coupled with stimulus from the new administration, regulators, members of Congress, states, non-governmental organizations, private parties, the courts and other
factors could result in a determination by the U.S. EPA to regulate CO2 emissions from electric power generation facilities. While the majority of current state, regional and federal
initiatives regarding CO2 emissions contemplate market-based compliance mechanisms (e.g., cap-and-trade), such a determination by the U.S. EPA could result
in CO2 emission limits on stationary sources that do not include market-based compliance mechanisms (e.g., carbon tax, CO2 emission limits, etc.). Any such regulations
could increase our costs directly and indirectly and have a material adverse affect on our business and/or results of operations. 


        At
the state level, RGGI, a cap-and-trade program covering CO2 emissions from electric power generation facilities in the Northeast, became effective
in January 2009, and the WCI, is also developing market-based programs to address GHG emissions in seven western states. In addition, several states, including California, have adopted comprehensive
legislation that, when implemented, will require mandatory GHG reductions from several industrial sectors, including the electric power generation industry. See "Business—Regulatory
Matters—Environmental and Land Use Regulations" of this Form 10-K for further discussion about the environmental regulations we face. At this time, other than with
regard to RGGI (further described below), the Company cannot estimate the costs of compliance with U.S. federal, regional or state CO2 emissions reductions legislation or initiatives, due
to the fact that these proposals are in earlier stages of development and any final regulations, if adopted, could vary drastically from current proposals. 

        The
RGGI program became effective in January 2009. The first regional auction of RGGI allowances needed to be acquired by power generators to comply with state programs implementing RGGI
was held in September 2008 and the second was held in December 2008. The third auction is scheduled for March 2009. Our subsidiaries in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Maryland are subject to
RGGI. Of the approximately 41.5 million metric tonnes of CO2 emitted in the United States by our subsidiaries in 2008 (ownership adjusted), approximately 11.8 million metric tonnes were
emitted in U.S. states participating in RGGI. We believe that due to the absence of allowance allocations, 

74




 

<A
HREF="#bg19101a_main_toc">Table of Contents



RGGI
as currently contemplated could have an adverse impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. While Co2 emissions from businesses
operated by subsidiaries of the Company are calculated globally in metric tonnes, RGGI allowances are denominated in short tons. (1 metric tonne equals 2,200 pounds and 1 short ton
equals 2,000 pounds.) For forecasting purposes, the Company has modeled the impact of CO2 compliance for 2009-2011 for its businesses that are subject to RGGI and that may not
be able to pass through compliance costs. The model includes a conversion from metric tonnes to short tons as well as the impact of some market recovery by merchant plants and contractual and
regulatory provisions. The model also utilizes an allowance price of $3.38 per metric tonne under RGGI. The source of this per allowance price estimate was the clearing price at the December 2008 RGGI
allowance auction. The model also assumes, among other things, that RGGI will be structured solely on the public auction of allowances and that certain costs will be recovered by our subsidiaries.
Based on these assumptions, the Company estimates that the RGGI compliance costs could be approximately $29.1 million per year
from 2009 through 2011, which is the last year of the first RGGI compliance period. Given all of the uncertainties surrounding RGGI, including those discussed in
Item 1—Business—Regulatory Matters—Environmental and Land Use Regulations of this Form 10-K and the fact that the assumptions utilized in
the model may prove to be incorrect, there is a significant risk that our actual compliance costs under RGGI will differ from estimates by a material amount. If the actual costs are higher, this could
have a material impact on our business and financial results. 

        In
addition to government regulators, other groups such as politicians, environmentalists and other private parties have expressed increasing concern about GHG emissions. For example,
certain financial institutions have expressed concern about providing financing for facilities which would emit GHGs, which can affect our ability to obtain capital, or if we can obtain capital, to
receive it on commercially viable terms. In addition, rating agencies may decide to downgrade our credit ratings based on the emissions of the businesses operated by our subsidiaries or increased
compliance costs which could make financing unattractive. In addition, as disclosed in Item 3—Legal Proceedings of this Form 10-K, the New York Attorney General
has issued a subpoena to the Company seeking documents and information concerning the Company's analysis and public disclosure of the potential impacts that GHG legislation and climate change from GHG
emissions might have on the Company's operations and financial results. Environmental groups and other private plaintiffs have brought and may decide to bring additional private lawsuits against the
Company because of its subsidiaries' GHG emissions. 

        Furthermore,
according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, physical risks from climate change could include, but are not limited to, increased runoff and earlier spring
peak discharge in many glacier and snow fed rivers, warming of lakes and rivers, an increase in sea level, changes and variability in precipitation and in the intensity and frequency of extreme
weather events. Physical impacts may have the potential to significantly affect the Company's business and operations. For example, extreme weather events could result in increased downtime and
operation and maintenance costs at the electric power generation facilities and support facilities of the Company's subsidiaries. Variations in weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity,
attributable to climate change, also would be expected to affect the energy needs of customers. A decrease in energy consumption could decrease the revenues of the Company's subsidiaries. In addition,
while revenues would be expected to increase if the energy consumption of customers increased, such increase could prompt the need for additional investment in generation capacity. Changes in the
temperature of lakes and rivers and changes in precipitation that result in drought could adversely affect the operations of the fossil-fuel fired electric power generation facilities of
the Company's subsidiaries. Changes in temperature, precipitation and snow pack conditions also could affect the amount and timing of hydroelectric generation. 


        If
any of the foregoing risks materialize, costs may increase or revenues may decrease and there could be a material adverse effect on the electric power generation businesses of the
Company's
