Beginning in 2016, we will offer new services and technical innovations including cloud connectivity for machines.  Presort ServicesWe are a national outsource provider of mail presort services for first-class, standard-class and flat mail in the U.S. and a workshare partner of the United States Postal Service (USPS). Our Presort Services network and fully-customized proprietary technology provides our clients with end-to-end solutions from pick up at their location to delivery into the postal system network. We process approximately 15 billion pieces of mail annually and are able to expedite mail delivery and optimize postage savings for our clients.Digital Commerce SolutionsWithin the Digital Commerce Solutions group, we provide a broad range of solutions, including customer information management, location intelligence and customer engagement software and shipping management and cross border ecommerce solutions for businesses of all sizes. These solutions are primarily delivered as traditional software licenses, enterprise platforms, software-as-a-service (SaaS) and on-demand applications. Our Digital Commerce Solutions group includes Software Solutions and Global Ecommerce. Software SolutionsCustomer information management solutions help businesses harness and deliver a deep and broad understanding of their customers and their context, such as location, relationships, propensity, sentiment and influence. The trusted data and associated insights allow our clients to deliver a personalized customer experience across multiple channels, manage risk and compliance, and improve sales, marketing and service effectiveness. We are one of the market leaders in the data quality segment. Large corporations and government agencies rely on our products in complex, high-volume, transactional environments to support their business processes.Location intelligence solutions enable our clients to organize and understand the complex relationships between location, geographic and other forms of data to drive business decisions and customer experiences. Our location intelligence solutions use predictive analytics, location, geographic and socio-demographic characteristics, which enable our clients to harness the power of location to better serve their customers, solve business problems, deliver location-based services and ultimately drive business growth.Customer engagement solutions provide clients with insight and understanding into customer behavior and interactions across the entire customer lifecycle, enabling them to orchestrate impactful, relevant and timely physical and digital interactions.

With our proprietary technology, we are able to manage all aspects of the international shopping and shipping experience, including multi-currency pricing, payment processing, fraud management, calculation of fully landed costs by quoting duty, taxes and shipping at checkout, compliance with product restrictions, export complexities and documentation requirements for customs clearance and brokerage and global logistics services. Our cross-border ecommerce software platforms are currently utilized by over 250 direct merchants as well as a major online marketplace enabling millions of parcels to be shipped to over 200 countries and territories worldwide. In 2015, we expanded our cross-border ecommerce capabilities through the acquisition of Borderfree, Inc. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Shipping management solutions enable clients to reduce transportation and logistics costs, select the best carrier based on need and cost, improve delivery times and track packages in real-time. We also offer scalable global logistics management systems that can be integrated into mail centers for the office and retail markets, as well as desktop and production shipping environments.See Item 7, "Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional segment and geographic information. Client ServiceWe have a client care service organization that provides telephone, online and on-site support to diagnose and repair our increasingly complex mailing equipment, production printers and sophisticated software solutions. Most of our support services are provided under annual contracts.Sales and MarketingWe market our products and services through a direct and inside sales force, direct mailings, telemarketing, independent dealers and distributors and web channels. We sell to a variety of business, governmental, institutional and other organizations, and in our Ecommerce business only, we also sell to consumers as well as a variety of businesses. We have a broad base of clients and are not dependent upon any one client or type of client for a significant part of our total revenue.  In 2014, we began a phased roll-out in our SMB Solutions operations of a strategy designed to provide clients broader access to products and services, improve the sales process and reduce costs by shifting more of our client coverage from field sales to inside sales. During 2015, we successfully rolled out this strategy worldwide and in 2016, we will begin shifting more client coverage activity to web channels.   We have made, and are continuing to make, significant investments in the rebranding of the company. These investments include marketing and advertising spending designed to build market awareness and client demand for our products and services, and enhance our operational and go-to-market changes, including how we sell to and service clients.CompetitionAll of our businesses face competition from a number of companies. Our competitors range from large, multinational companies that compete against many of our businesses to smaller, more narrowly focused regional and local firms. We compete on the basis of technology and innovation; breadth of product offerings; our ability to design and tailor solutions to specific client needs; performance; client service and support; price; quality and brand.We must continue to invest in our current technologies, products and solutions, and in the development of new technologies, products and solutions in order to maintain and improve our competitive position. We will encounter new competitors as we transition to higher value markets and offerings and enter new markets.  A summary of the competitive environment for each of our business segments is as follows:North America Mailing and International MailingWe face significant competition from other mail equipment and software companies, companies that offer products and services as alternative means of message communications and non-traditional competitors that offer shipping and mailing products and services through online solutions. The principal competitive factors include the composition of offerings between software and hardware solutions, pricing, available financing and payment offerings, product reliability, support services, industry knowledge and expertise and attractiveness of alternative communication methods. Our competitive advantage includes our breadth of physical and web-based digital offerings, customer service and our extensive knowledge of the shipping and mailing industry.  5Through our wholly owned subsidiary, The Pitney Bowes Bank (the Bank), we offer a revolving credit solution to our SMB clients in the United States that enables them to pay for postage, the rental of certain mailing equipment and purchase products, supplies and services. The Bank also provides an interest-bearing deposit solution to those clients in the United States who prefer to prepay postage. We also provide similar revolving credit solutions to our clients in Canada and the U.K but do not offer these through the Bank in overseas markets. Our financing operations face competition, in varying degrees, from large, diversified financial institutions, including leasing companies, commercial finance companies and commercial banks, as well as small, specialized firms. Not all our competitors are able to offer these financing and payment solutions to their customers and we believe these solutions differentiate us from our competitors and are a source of competitive advantage. The Bank is chartered as an Industrial Bank under the laws of the State of Utah, and regulated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions.  Production MailWe face competition from other companies that offer large production printers, inserters or sorters. We also face competition from the fact that some companies choose to outsource although those outsource providers can also be our customers. Our competitive advantage lies in our ability to offer all of these products and services and integrate them into an end-to-end solution. The principal competitive factors include functionality, reliability, productivity, price and support. Presort ServicesWe face competition from regional and local presort providers, service bureaus that offer presort solutions as part of a larger bundle of outsourcing services and large entities that have the capability to presort their own mailings in-house. The principal competitive factors include innovative service, delivery speed, industry expertise and economies of scale. Our competitive advantage includes our extensive network of presort facilities capable of processing significant volumes of mail and our innovative and proprietary technology that enables us to provide our clients with reliable and accurate services at maximum discounts. Software Solutions We operate in several highly competitive and rapidly evolving markets and face competition ranging from large global companies that offer a broad suite of solutions to smaller, more narrowly-focused companies that can design very targeted solutions. The principal competitive factors include reliability, functionality and ease of integration and use, scalability, innovation, support services and price. We compete based on the accuracy and processing speed of our solutions, particularly those used in our location intelligence solutions, the breadth and scalability of our products and solutions, our geocoding and reverse geocoding capabilities, and our ability to identify rapidly changing customer needs and develop technologies and solutions to meet these changing needs.  Global EcommerceThe market for international ecommerce software and fulfillment services is highly fragmented, and includes competitors of various sizes, including companies with greater financial resources than us, some that specialize in point solutions or freight forwarding services, full-service ecommerce business process outsourcers and online marketplaces with international logistic support. In addition, major global delivery services companies are acquiring the technology to improve their cross border ecommerce shipping capabilities. The principal competitive factors include reliability, functionality and ease of integration and use, scalability, innovation, support services and price. We compete based on the accuracy, reliability and scalability of our platform, and our ability to provide our clients and their customers a one-stop full-service cross border ecommerce experience. Financing SolutionsWe offer a variety of finance and payment solutions to clients to finance their equipment and product purchases, rental and lease payments, postage replenishment and supplies purchases. We establish credit approval limits and procedures based on the credit quality of the client and the type of product or service provided to control risk in extending credit to clients. In addition, we utilize a systematic decision program for certain leases. This program is designed to facilitate low dollar transactions by utilizing historical payment patterns and losses realized for clients with common credit characteristics. The program defines the criteria under which we will accept a client without performing a more detailed credit investigation, such as maximum equipment cost, a client's time in business and payment experience. We closely monitor the portfolio by analyzing industry sectors and delinquency trends by product line, industry and client to ensure reserve levels and credit policies reflect current trends. Management continues to closely monitor credit lines and collection resources and revise credit policies as necessary to be more selective in managing the portfolio. 6Research, Development and Intellectual PropertyWe invest in research and development programs to develop new products and solutions, enhance the effectiveness and functionality of existing products and solutions and deliver high value technology, innovative software and differentiated services in high value segments of the market. As a result of our research and development efforts, we have been awarded a number of patents with respect to several of our existing and planned products. However, our businesses are not materially dependent on any one patent or license or group of related patents or licenses. Research and development expenditures were $110 million, in each of 2015, 2014 and 2013. Material SuppliersWe depend on third-party suppliers for a variety of services, components, supplies and a large portion of our product manufacturing.  In certain instances, we rely on single-sourced or limited-sourced suppliers around the world because the relationship is advantageous due to quality, price, or there are no alternative sources. We have not historically experienced shortages in services, components or products and believe that our available sources for materials, components, services and supplies are adequate.Regulatory Matters We are subject to the regulations of postal authorities worldwide related to product specifications and business practices involving our postage meters. We are further subject to the regulations of the State of Utah Department of Financial Institutions and the FDIC with respect to the operations of the Bank and certain company affiliates that provide services to the Bank. We are also subject to the regulations of transportation, customs and other trade authorities worldwide related to the cross-border shipment of equipment, materials and parcels. In addition, we are subject to regulations worldwide concerning data privacy and security for our businesses that use, process and store certain personal, confidential or proprietary data. Employees and Employee Relations At December 31, 2015, we have approximately 10,500 employees in North America and 4,300 employees internationally. We believe that our current relations with employees are good. Management keeps employees informed of decisions and encourages and implements employee suggestions whenever practicable.Available InformationOur Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments thereto filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), are available, free of charge, through the Investor Relations section of our website at www.pb.com/investorrelations or from the SEC's website at www.sec.gov, as soon as reasonably practicable after these reports are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.

RISK FACTORSOur operations face certain risks that should be considered in evaluating our business. We manage and mitigate these risks on a proactive basis, including through the use of an enterprise risk management program. Nevertheless, the following risk factors, some of which may be beyond our control, could materially impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, brand and reputation, and may cause future results to be materially different than our current expectations. These risk factors are not intended to be all inclusive.We are subject to postal regulations and processes, which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability.A significant portion of our revenue and profitability is directly or indirectly subject to regulation and oversight by postal authorities worldwide. We depend on a healthy postal sector in the geographic markets where we do business, which could be influenced positively or negatively by legislative or regulatory changes in those countries. Our revenue and profitability in a particular country could be affected by adverse changes in postal regulations, the business processes and practices of individual posts, the decision of a post to enter into particular markets in direct competition with us and the impact of any of these changes on postal competitors that do not use our products or services. These changes could affect product specifications, service offerings, client behavior and the overall mailing industry. If we are not able to respond to the continuing decline in the volume of physical mail delivered via traditional postal services, our results of operations and profitability could be adversely impacted. Declining mail volumes has had an adverse impact on our revenues and profitability and is expected to continue to influence our revenue and profitability in the future. We continue to employ strategies for stabilizing the mailing business which include new product and service offerings, transitioning our current products and services to more digital offerings and providing our clients broader access to products and services through online and direct sales channels. There is no guarantee that these offerings will be widely accepted in the marketplace, and they will likely face competition from existing and emerging alternative products and services. Further, an accelerated or sudden decline in physical mail volumes could have an adverse effect on our mailing business.  An accelerated or sudden decline could result from, among other things, changes in our clients' communication behavior, changes in communication technologies or legislation or regulations that mandate electronic substitution, prohibit certain types of mailings, increase the difficulty of using information or materials in the mail, or impose higher taxes or fees on mailing or postal services.  If we are not successful at meeting the continuing challenges faced in our mailing business, or if physical mail volumes were to experience an accelerated or sudden decline, our financial results could be negatively impacted.  We may not realize the anticipated benefits from our implementation of a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, and the transition to the new ERP system may not be uninterrupted or error-free.We have made, and will continue to make, significant investments in the development and implementation of a new ERP system that is expected to provide operating cost savings through the elimination of redundant systems and strategic efficiencies through the use of a standardized, integrated system. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we completed the implementation of the ERP system for our Canadian operations and will begin implementing this system in the U.S. in 2016.  If the implementation of the ERP system in the U.S. is not successful, or is delayed, the expected operating cost savings and strategic efficiencies may be delayed or may not be obtained or sustainable and may prevent us from introducing new products or services.   Further, the transition to the new ERP system will affect numerous systems necessary for the company's operation. If we fail to correctly implement one or more components of the ERP system, we could experience significant disruption to our operations. Such disruptions could include, among other things, temporary loss of data, inability to process certain orders, failure of systems to communicate with each other and the inability to track or reconcile key data.9If we are unable to protect our information technology systems against service interruptions, misappropriation of data, or breaches of security resulting from cyber-attacks or other events, or we encounter other unforeseen difficulties in the operation of our information technology systems, our operations could be disrupted, our reputation may be harmed and we could be subject to legal liability or regulatory enforcement action.We rely on the continuous and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems to support numerous business processes and activities, to support and service our clients, to support consumer transactions and to support postal services. Several of our businesses use, process and store proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our businesses, our clients, consumers and our employees. Privacy laws and similar regulations in many jurisdictions where we do business require that we take significant steps to safeguard such information, and such legal requirements continue to evolve. In today's environment there are numerous risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including individual and groups of criminal hackers, industrial espionage, employee errors and/or malfeasance and technological errors. These cyber threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. We have security systems and procedures in place designed to ensure the continuous and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems and protect against unauthorized access to such information. However, there is no guarantee that these security measures will prevent or detect the unauthorized access by experienced computer programmers, hackers or others. Successful breaches could, among other things, result in the unauthorized disclosure, theft and misuse of company, client, consumer and employee sensitive and confidential information, disrupt the performance of our information technology systems and deny services to our clients. Additionally, we could be exposed to potential liability, litigation, governmental inquiries, investigations or regulatory enforcement actions, our brand and reputation damaged, and we could be subject to the payment of fines or other penalties, legal claims by our clients and significant remediation costs.Our systems are also subject to adverse acts of nature, computer viruses, vandalism, power loss, computer or communications failures and other unexpected events. We have business continuity and disaster recovery plans in place to protect our business operations in case of such events; however, there can be no guarantee that these plans will function as designed. If our information technology systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we could be prevented from fulfilling orders and servicing clients and postal services. Also, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace these systems, and could suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our operations. We depend on third-party suppliers and outsource providers and our business could be adversely affected if we fail to manage these vendors effectively.We depend on third-party suppliers and outsource providers for a variety of services, components and supplies, including a large portion of our product manufacturing, the hosting of our software-as-a-service offerings, as well as the logistics portion of our cross-border ecommerce business, and some non-core functions and operations. In certain instances, we rely on single-sourced or limited-sourced suppliers and outsourcing vendors around the world because doing so is advantageous due to quality, price or lack of alternative sources. If production or services were interrupted and we were not able to find alternate third-party suppliers, we could experience disruptions in manufacturing and operations including product shortages, higher freight costs and re-engineering costs. If outsourcing services were interrupted, not performed, or the performance was poor, our ability to process, record and report transactions with our clients, consumers and other constituents could be impacted. Such interruptions in the provision of supplies and/or services could impact our ability to meet client demand, damage our reputation and client relationships and adversely affect our revenue and profitability.Capital market disruptions and credit rating downgrades could adversely affect our ability to provide competitive financing services to our clients and to fund various discretionary priorities.  Our financing activities include, among other things, providing competitive financing offerings to our clients and funding various discretionary priorities, such as business investments, strategic acquisitions, share repurchases and dividend payments. We fund these activities through a combination of cash generated from operations, deposits held in the Bank, commercial paper borrowings and long-term borrowings.Our ability to fund these activities is dependent, in part, upon our ability to borrow and the cost of borrowing in U.S. capital markets. This ability and the cost, in turn, is dependent upon our credit ratings and is subject to capital market volatility. A credit ratings downgrade, an increase in the company's credit default swap spread, material capital market disruptions, significant withdrawals by depositors at the Bank, adverse changes to our industrial loan charter or a significant decline in cash flow could impact our ability to provide competitive finance offerings to our clients and fund other financing activities, which in turn, could adversely affect our revenue, profitability and financial condition. 10The international nature of our Global Ecommerce segment subjects us to increased customs and regulatory risks from cross-border transactions, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Further, the loss of any of our largest clients in our Global Ecommerce segment could have a material adverse effect on the segment.International sales generated by our clients processing transactions through our platform are the primary source of both revenue and profit for the Global Ecommerce segment. Our Global Ecommerce segment is subject to significant trade regulations, taxes, and duties throughout the world. Any changes to these regulations could potentially impose increased documentation and delivery requirements, increase costs, delay delivery times, and subject us to additional liabilities, which could negatively impact our ability to compete in international markets and adversely impact our revenues and profitability.  The operating results of, and sales generated from, many of our clients’ internationally focused websites running on our platform are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Currently, our platforms are located in the United States and United Kingdom and a majority of consumers making purchases through these platforms are in a limited number of foreign countries. A strengthening of the U.S. Dollar or British Pound relative to currencies in the countries where we do the most business impacts our ability to compete internationally as the cost of similar international products improves relative to the cost of U.S. and U.K. retailers' products. A strong U.S. Dollar or British Pound would likely result in a decrease in international sales volumes, which would adversely affect the segment's revenue and profitability.The Global Ecommerce segment is dependent on a relatively small number of significant clients and business partners for a large portion of its revenue.  The loss of any of these larger clients or business partners, or a substantial reduction in their use of our products or services, could have a material adverse effect on the revenue and profitability of the segment.  There can be no assurance that our larger clients and business partners will continue to utilize our products or services at current levels, or that we would be able to replace any of these clients or business partners with others who can generate revenue at current levels.  Our inability to obtain and protect our intellectual property and defend against claims of infringement by others may negatively impact our operating results.  Our business success depends in part upon protecting our intellectual property rights, including proprietary technology developed or obtained through acquisitions. We rely on copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secrets and other intellectual property laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position may suffer which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability. From time to time, third-parties may claim that we, our clients, or our suppliers, have infringed their intellectual property rights. These claims, if successful, may require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements, pay damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain products. If we fail to comply with government contracting regulations, our operating results, brand name and reputation could suffer.We have a significant number of contracts with governmental entities. Government contracts are subject to extensive and complex procurement laws and regulations, along with regular audits and investigations by government agencies. If one or more government agencies discovers instances of contractual non-compliance in the course of an audit or investigation, we may be subject to various civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, which could include the termination of the contract, reimbursement of payments received, fines and debarment from doing business with one or more governments.  Any of these events could not only affect us financially, but also adversely affect our brand and reputation.We may not realize the anticipated benefits of strategic acquisitions and divestitures, which may harm our financial results.As we increase our focus towards providing more digital technology and software solutions while maintaining a leadership role in the mailing industry, we may make strategic acquisitions or divest certain businesses. These acquisitions and divestitures may involve significant risks and uncertainties, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results, including:•difficulties in achieving anticipated benefits or synergies from acquisitions and divestitures; •difficulties in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations, including combining product and service offerings and entering new markets, or reducing fixed costs previously associated with divested businesses;•the loss of key employees or clients of businesses acquired or divested; and•significant charges to earnings for employee severance and other restructuring costs, goodwill and asset impairments and legal, accounting and financial advisory fees.11Our investment in rebranding the company and enhancing marketing programs to build the market awareness necessary to create demand for our businesses may not result in increased revenue and could adversely affect our profitability.Our new brand strategy and identity are important to the next phase of our global business transformation. Our phased roll-out of the new branding through an advertising campaign, which is now entering a new phase in its progress, is integrated into the way we sell and service clients, and acquire new clients, including sales collateral and the digital experience of getting information, service performance and transacting on our website. These factors are important to maintaining acceptance of our products and services by our existing clients and achieving increased acceptance with new clients. We expect increased spending in brand development and marketing promotion activities and if this increased spending does not result in increased revenue sufficient to offset these expenses, our profitability could be adversely affected. Our operational costs could increase from changes in environmental regulations, or it could be subject to significant liabilities.We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations around the world, including without limitation, those related to the manufacture, distribution, use, packaging, labeling, recycling or disposal of our products or the products of our clients for whom we perform services. Environmental rules concerning products and packaging can have a significant impact on the cost of operations or affect our ability to do business in certain countries. We are also subject to laws concerning use, discharge or disposal of materials. All of these laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. If we are found to have violated these laws, we could be fined, criminally charged, otherwise sanctioned by regulators, or we could be subject to liability and clean-up costs. These risk can apply to both current and legacy operations and sites. From time to time, we may be involved in litigation over these issues. The amount and timing of costs under environmental laws are difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that these costs will not have an adverse effect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.12ITEM 1B
