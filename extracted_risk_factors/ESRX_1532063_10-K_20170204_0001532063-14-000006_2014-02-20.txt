 — Risk Factors” in this Annual Report and any other information included or incorporated by reference in this Report, and information which may be contained in our other filings with the SEC, should be carefully considered when reviewing any forward-looking statement. We note these factors for investors as permitted under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Investors should understand that it is impossible to predict or identify all such factors or risks. As such, you should not consider either foregoing lists, or the risks identified in our SEC filings, to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.Item 1A — Risk FactorsGeneral Risk FactorsWe operate in a very competitive industry, which could compress our margins and impair our ability to attract and retain clients. Our failure to effectively differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors could magnify the impact of the competitive environment.We operate in a highly competitive environment and an industry that is subject to significant market pressures brought about by customer demands, legislative and regulatory developments and other market factors. We must remain competitive in order to attract new clients and retain and cross-sell additional products and services to our existing clients. Strong competition in the PBM marketplace has generated greater client demand for lower pricing, increased revenue sharing and enhanced product and service offerings. These competitive factors have historically created pressure on our operating margins and caused many PBMs, including us, to reduce the prices charged for core products and services while sharing a greater portion of the formulary fees and related revenues received from pharmaceutical manufacturers with clients. We cannot assume that positive trends such as lower drug purchasing costs, increased generic usage, drug price inflation, increased rebates, favorable demographics and specialty growth would offset these pressures in the future. Our inability to maintain these positive trends, or failure to identify and implement new ways to mitigate pricing pressures, could negatively impact our ability to attract or retain clients which could negatively impact our margins and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.In addition, our clients are well informed and organized and can easily move between us and our competitors. Our client contracts are generally three years and our larger clients typically seek competing bids from our competitors prior to contract expiration. These factors together with the impact of competitive pressures could make it difficult for us to attract new clients, retain existing clients and cross-sell additional services, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.In order to succeed in the highly competitive PBM marketplace, it is imperative that we maintain a strong reputation as well as differentiate our business offerings by innovating and delivering products and services that demonstrate enhanced value to our clients, particularly in response to market changes from public policy. The negative reputational impact of a significant event, including a failure to execute on client contracts or to successfully integrate the business of ESI and Medco or to otherwise successfully operate the complex structure of our business or otherwise innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate greater value to our clients, could therefore affect our ability to grow and retain profitable clients which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.The managed care industry has undergone periods of substantial consolidation and may continue to consolidate in the future. If one or more of our managed care clients is acquired, and the acquiring entity is not a client, then we may be unable to retain all or a portion of the acquired business. If such acquisitions, individually or in the aggregate, are material, they could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.The delivery of healthcare-related products and services is an evolving and rapidly changing industry. Our failure to anticipate or appropriately adapt to changes or trends within the industry could have a negative impact on our ability to compete and adversely affect our business and results of operations.We have designed our business model to compete within the current industry structure. Our client contracts are generally three years and our pharmaceutical manufacturer and retail contracts are typically non-exclusive and terminable on relatively short notice by either party. Any significant shifts in the structure of the PBM industry or the healthcare products and 18Table of Contentsservices industry in general could alter the industry dynamics and adversely affect our ability to attract or retain clients. Such industry shifts could result from, among others: a large intra- or inter-industry merger, a new entrant (including the government), a new business model, a general decrease in drug utilization, reduced USPS service or the consolidation of shipping carriers, or the necessary changes or unintended consequences of the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the “Health Reform Laws”). Our failure to anticipate or appropriately adapt to changes in the industry could negatively impact our competitive position and adversely affect our business and results of operations.We operate in a complex and rapidly evolving regulatory environment. Changes in applicable laws, rules or regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, or the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, could require us to make significant changes to our business operations or result in the imposition of fines or penalties. Further, we may be required to spend significant resources in order to comply with new, changing or existing laws, rules and regulations. Numerous state and federal laws, rules and regulations affect our business and operations and include, among others, the following:•healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, which prohibit certain types of payments and referrals as well as false claims made in connection with health benefit programs•ERISA and related regulations, which regulate many aspects of healthcare plan arrangements•state legislation regulating PBMs or imposing fiduciary status on PBMs•consumer protection and unfair trade practice laws and regulations•network pharmacy access laws, including “any willing provider” and “due process” legislation, that affect aspects of our pharmacy network contracts•wholesale distributor laws•legislation imposing benefit plan design restrictions and requirements, which limit how our clients can design their drug benefit plans•various licensure laws, such as managed care and third-party administrator licensure laws•drug pricing legislation, including “most favored nation” pricing•pharmacy laws and regulations•state insurance regulations applicable to our insurance subsidiaries•information privacy and security laws and regulations, including those under the HIPAA omnibus rule•Medicare prescription drug program participation requirements including coverage standards and beneficiary protections•other Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement regulations, including subrogation•the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Reform Laws, including regulations applicable to clients operating qualified health plans through the state and federal marketplace (“Health Insurance Exchange”)•federal laws related to our Department of Defense arrangement•federal antitrust laws related to our pharmacy, pharmaceutical manufacturer and client relationships•international lawsThese and other regulatory matters are discussed in more detail under “Part I — Item 1 — Business — Government Regulation and Compliance” above.We believe that we are operating our business in substantial compliance with all existing material legal requirements applicable to us. However, significant uncertainties exist regarding the application of many of these legal requirements to our business. From time to time, state and federal law enforcement agencies and regulatory agencies have initiated investigations or litigation involving certain aspects of our business or our competitors’ businesses and, consequently, we cannot provide any assurance that one or more of these agencies will not interpret or apply these legal requirements in a manner adverse to our business, or, if there is an enforcement action brought against us, that our interpretation would prevail. In addition, there are numerous proposed healthcare laws, rules and regulations at the federal and state levels, many of which could materially affect aspects of our business or adversely affect our results of operations. We are unable to predict whether 19Table of Contentsadditional federal or state legislation or regulatory initiatives relating to our business or the healthcare industry in general will be enacted in the future or what effect, if any, such legislation or regulations may have on us. Due to these uncertainties, we may be required to spend significant resources in connection with any such investigation or litigation or to comply with new or existing laws and regulations.In addition, the laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject, including those related to financial disclosure, are complex and require significant resources to remain compliant. Any substantial non-compliance with such legal and regulatory requirements could result in significant fines and penalties or a restatement of our financial statements, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.Various governmental agencies have conducted investigations and audits into certain PBM business practices. Many of these investigations and audits have resulted in other PBMs agreeing to civil penalties, including the payment of money and corporate integrity agreements. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such governmental investigations and audits may ultimately have on us or on the PBM industry in general (see “Part I — Item 3 — Legal Proceedings”). However, we may experience additional government scrutiny and audit activity related to Medco’s government program services, including audits that Accredo Health Group face or may face which result in payment or offset of prior reimbursement from the government.In 2010, the federal court in the District of Columbia overturned a previously enacted statute by the District of Columbia that purports to declare that a PBM is a fiduciary with respect to its clients (see “Part I — Item 1 — Business — Government Regulation and Compliance — State Fiduciary Legislation”). However, other states are considering but have not yet enacted similar fiduciary statutes, and we cannot predict what effect, if any, these and similar statutes, if enacted, may have on our business and financial results, nor can we predict how other courts may view such laws.Policies designed to manage healthcare costs or alter healthcare financing practices or changes to government policies in general may adversely impact our business and results of operations.From time to time, certain legislative and/or regulatory proposals are made which seek to manage the cost of healthcare, including prescription drug cost. Such proposals include “single-payer” government funded healthcare, changes in reimbursement rates, restrictions on access or therapeutic substitution, limits on more efficient delivery channels, taxes on goods and services, price controls on prescription drugs and other significant healthcare reform proposals. In addition, changes to government policies not specifically targeted to the healthcare industry, such as an increase in the corporate tax rate or government spending cuts, could have significant impacts on the PBM marketplace. We are unable to predict whether any such policies or proposals will be enacted, or the specific terms thereof. Certain of these policies or proposals, however, if enacted, could adversely impact our business and results of operations.The implementation of the Health Reform Laws could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In March 2010, the federal government enacted the Health Reform Laws, which will be gradually phased in through 2020 (see “Part I — Item 1 — Business — Government Regulation and Compliance — Federal Healthcare Reform”). The Health Reform Laws contain many provisions that directly or indirectly apply to us, our clients, employers and benefit providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, healthcare providers and others with whom we do business, including:•PBM disclosure requirements in the context of Medicare Part D and the Health Insurance Exchanges•new federal regulations applicable to health plans offered by insurance companies, employers and other plan sponsors•state and federal regulations applicable to health plans offered in the Health Insurance Exchanges•medical loss ratio requirements, which require insurers to spend a specified percentage of premium revenues on incurred claims or healthcare quality improvements, and require some of our clients to report certain types of PBM proprietary information•various health insurance taxes and fees•changes to the calculation of average manufacturer price (“AMP”) of drugs and an increase in the rebate amounts drug manufacturers must pay to states for drugs reimbursed by state Medicaid programs, including through Medicaid managed care organizations•imposition of new fees on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers of brand-name prescription drugs•expansion of the 340B drug discount program, which limits the costs of certain outpatient drugs to qualified health centers and hospitals20Table of Contents•risk adjustments, risk corridors and reinsurance requirements that affect certain of our clients•closing of the so-called donut hole under Medicare Part D by lowering beneficiary coinsurance amounts•elimination of the tax deduction for employers who receive Medicare Part D retiree drug subsidy payments•mandated changes to client plan designs•changes to certain healthcare fraud and abuse lawsThe scope and ultimate effect of such provisions on our business remains uncertain and we cannot predict the impact that any interim or final implementation will have on our business and results of operations.We face risks associated with general economic conditions.The state of the economy can have a significant impact on our business and results of operations. An unfavorable or uncertain economic environment could significantly and adversely affect our businesses and profitability and generate the following risks to our business:•clients, employers and other benefit providers served by our clients may reduce or slow the growth of their workforce or covered membership, or may elect to discontinue or diminish provided benefits, which would result in a reduction in the number of members we serve•consumers may be less willing or able to incur health care related expenses, whether due to personal economic circumstances, reduction in the level of the health care benefit provided to the consumer or otherwise, which would result in lower than anticipated utilization•our clients, or potential clients, may increase demands and expectations with respect to pricing, rebates or service levels (including with respect to performance guarantees), which would impact margins, or our ability to obtain new clients or retain existing clients•our clients, or potential clients, may be less willing to purchase additional products and services from us, which would impact our financial performanceUnfavorable and uncertain economic conditions may also cause disruptions in the credit markets which could increase our cost of borrowing or make credit unavailable on acceptable terms to the extent we need additional funds. Such developments may adversely affect our business and results of operations.Our ability to conduct operations depends on the security and stability of our technology infrastructure as well as the effectiveness of, and our ability to execute, business continuity plans across our operations. A failure in the security of our technology infrastructure or a significant disruption in service within our operations could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.We maintain, and are dependent on, a technology infrastructure platform that is essential for many aspects of our business operations. We have many different information systems and it is imperative that we securely store and transmit confidential data, including personal health information, while maintaining the integrity of our confidential information. Any failure to protect against a security breach or a disruption in service could negatively impact our reputation and materially adversely impact our business operations and results of operations. Our technology infrastructure platform requires significant resources to maintain and enhance systems in order to keep pace with rapid technological change as well as evolving industry and regulatory standards. Emerging and advanced security threats, including coordinated attacks, require additional layers of security which may disrupt or impact efficiency of operations. From time to time, we may obtain significant portions of our systems-related or other services or facilities from independent third parties, which may make our operations vulnerable to such third parties’ failure to adequately perform or protect against a security breach or service disruption. In the event we or our vendors experience:•a malfunction in business processes•security breaches (including from cyber- or phishing-attacks)•failure to maintain effective and up-to-date information systems or•otherwise experience unauthorized or non-compliant actions by any individualWe could incur disruptions to our business operations or negative impacts to patient safety, customer and member disputes, damage to our reputation, exposures to risk of loss, litigation or regulatory violations, increased administrative expenses or other adverse consequences.21Table of ContentsWe operate dispensing pharmacies, call centers, data centers and corporate facilities that depend on the security and stability of our technology infrastructure. Our technology infrastructure could be disrupted by any number of events including a general failure of the technology, malfunction of business process or a disaster or other catastrophic event. In addition, our vendor and supply chain is dependent on a number of different products and third parties and could be disrupted. Such disruptions could, temporarily or indefinitely, significantly reduce, or partially or totally eliminate our ability to process and dispense prescriptions and provide products and services to our clients and members. Any such service disruption at these facilities or to this infrastructure or our failure to implement adequate business continuity and disaster recovery strategies could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.A substantial portion of our business is concentrated in certain significant client contracts. Our failure to execute on or other issues arising under, such contracts or conditions or trends impacting certain of our key clients could adversely affect our business and results of operations.As described in greater detail in the discussion of our business in Item 1 above (see “Part I — Item 1 — Business — Clients”), we have long-term contracts with WellPoint, Inc. (“WellPoint”) and the United States Department of Defense (“DoD”). Our top 5 clients, including WellPoint and DoD, collectively represented 38.4% and 39.3% of our revenue during 2013 and 2012, respectively.On July 21, 2011, Medco announced that its pharmacy benefit services agreement with UnitedHealth Group would not be renewed, although Medco continued to provide services under an agreement, which expired on December 31, 2012. A transition agreement was in place throughout 2013, during which time patients moved in tranches off of the Medco platform.If one or more of our large clients either terminates or does not renew a contract for any reason or if the provisions of a contract with a large client are modified, renewed or otherwise changed with terms that are less favorable to us, our financial results could be materially adversely affected and we could experience a negative reaction in the investment community resulting in stock price declines or other adverse effects.If we are not able to replace lost business or margin by generating new sales with comparable operating margins or successfully executing other corporate strategies, our revenues and results of operations could suffer. In addition, if certain of our key clients are negatively impacted by business conditions or other economic trends, or if such clients are acquired, consolidated or otherwise fail to successfully maintain or grow their business, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.If significant changes occur within the pharmacy provider marketplace, or if other issues arise with respect to our pharmacy networks, including the loss of or adverse change in our relationship with one or more key pharmacy providers, our business and financial results could be impaired.More than 68,000 retail pharmacies, which represent over 95% of all United States retail pharmacies, participated in one or more of our networks at December 31, 2013. The ten largest retail pharmacy chains represent approximately 60% of the total number of stores in our largest network. In certain geographic areas of the United States, our networks may be comprised of higher concentrations of one or more large pharmacy chains. Contracts with retail pharmacies are generally non-exclusive and are terminable on relatively short notice by either party. If one or more of the larger pharmacy chains terminates its relationship with us, or is able to renegotiate terms that are substantially less favorable to us, our members’ access to retail pharmacies and/or our business could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the entry of one or more large pharmacy chains into the PBM business in addition to the current pharmacy chain competitors, or the consolidation of existing pharmacy chains, could increase the likelihood of negative changes in our relationship with such pharmacies. Changes in the overall composition of our pharmacy networks, or reduced pharmacy access under our networks, could have a negative impact on our claims volume and/or our competitiveness in the marketplace, which could cause us to fall short of certain guarantees in our contracts with clients or otherwise impair our business or results of operations.Regulatory or business changes relating to our participation in Medicare Part D, the loss of Medicare Part D eligible members, or our failure to otherwise execute on our strategies related to Medicare Part D, could adversely impact our business and our results of operations. Certain of our subsidiaries have been approved to function as a Part D prescription drug plan (“PDP”) sponsor for the purpose of making employer/union-only group waiver plans available for eligible clients and certain of our insurance subsidiaries have been approved by CMS to participate in the Medicare Part D program as a national PDP sponsor that provides direct services to Medicare Part D eligible members. We also provide other products and services in support of our clients’ Medicare Part D plans or federal Retiree Drug Subsidy. We have made, and may be required to make further, substantial investments in the personnel and technology necessary to administer our Medicare Part D strategy and operations. There are many uncertainties about the financial and regulatory risks of participating in the Medicare Part D program, and we can give no assurance that these risks will not materially adversely impact our business and results of operations.22Table of ContentsCertain of our insurance subsidiaries are subject to various contractual and regulatory compliance requirements associated with participating in Medicare Part D. As insurers organized and licensed under applicable state laws, certain subsidiaries are subject to aspects of state laws regulating the business of insurance in all jurisdictions in which they offer PDP services. As PDP sponsors, certain subsidiaries are required to comply with certain federal Medicare Part D laws and regulations applicable to PDP sponsors. Additionally, the receipt of federal funds made available through the Part D program by us, our affiliates or clients is subject to compliance with the Part D regulations and established laws and regulations governing the federal government’s payment for healthcare goods and services, including the anti-kickback laws and the federal False Claims Act. If material contractual or regulatory non-compliance was to be identified, including, for example, during CMS audits or client audits in cases where we service PDP sponsors, recoupment, monetary penalties and/or applicable sanctions, including suspension of enrollment and marketing or debarment from participation in Medicare programs, could be imposed. Further, the adoption or promulgation of new or more complex regulatory requirements or changes in the interpretation of existing regulatory requirements, in each case, associated with Medicare may require us to incur significant compliance-related costs which could adversely impact our business and our results of operations.In addition, due to the availability of Medicare Part D, some of our employer clients may stop providing pharmacy benefit coverage to retirees, instead allowing retirees to choose their own Part D plans, which could cause a reduction in utilization for our services. Extensive competition among Medicare Part D plans could also result in the loss of Medicare members by our managed care customers, which would cause a decline in our membership base. Further, certain of our Part D product offerings require premium payment from members for the ongoing benefit, as well as amounts due from CMS, and as a result of the demographics of the calculations, as well as the potential magnitude and timing of settlement for amounts due from CMS, these accounts receivable are subject to billing and realization risk in excess of what is experienced in the core PBM business.Like many aspects of our business, the administration of the Medicare Part D program is complex and any failure to effectively execute the provisions of the Medicare Part D program may have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows. As discussed above, the Health Reform Laws contain various changes to the Part D program and could have a financial impact on our PDP and our clients’ demand for our other Part D products and services.We have historically engaged in strategic transactions, including the acquisition of other companies or businesses, and may engage in similar transactions in the future. Our failure to effectively execute on such transactions or to integrate any acquired businesses could adversely impact our business and results of operations. The successful acquisition and integration of any such business will create significant transaction costs and require significant resources and management attention.We have historically engaged in strategic transactions, including the acquisition of other companies and businesses. These transactions typically involve the integration of core business operations and technology infrastructure platforms that require significant resources and management attention and, among other things, risk client service disruption. A failure or significant delay in the integration process could have a material adverse effect on our client service or our business and results of operations. In addition, such transactions may yield higher operating costs, greater customer attrition or more significant business disruption than anticipated. Further, even if the integration is successful, there can be no assurance that a transaction will result in the realization of the expected benefits of synergies, cost savings, innovation and operational efficiencies, or that any realized benefits will be achieved within the anticipated time frame or an otherwise reasonable period of time.Strategic transactions, including the pursuit of such transactions, often require us to incur significant up-front costs. These costs are typically non-recurring expenses related to the assessment, due diligence, negotiation and execution of the transaction. We may also incur additional costs to retain key employees as well as transaction fees and costs related to executing our integration plans. Although we would generally pursue the realization of efficiencies related to the integration of a business to offset incremental transaction and acquisition-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all.Our business operations involve the substantial receipt and use of confidential health information concerning individuals and a failure to adequately protect such information could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Most of our activities involve the receipt or use of protected health information concerning individuals. We also use aggregated and anonymized data for research and analysis purposes, and in some cases, provide access to such data to pharmaceutical manufacturers and third-party data aggregators and analysts. There is substantial regulation at the federal and state levels addressing the use, disclosure and security of patient identifiable health information. At the federal level, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the regulations issued thereunder (collectively “HIPAA”) impose extensive requirements governing the transmission, use and disclosure of health information by all participants in health care delivery, including physicians, hospitals, insurers and other payors. Many of these obligations were expanded under the Health Information and Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (the “HITECH Act”), passed as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Failure to comply with standards issued pursuant to federal or state statutes or regulations may result in criminal penalties and civil sanctions. In addition to these regulations, future regulations and 23Table of Contentslegislation that severely restricts or prohibits our use of patient identifiable or other information could limit our ability to use information critical to the operation of our business. Furthermore, if we violate a patient’s privacy or are found to have violated any federal or state statute or regulation with regard to confidentiality or dissemination or use of protected health information, we could be liable for significant damages, fines or penalties and suffer reputational harm, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Difficulty in integrating the business of Express Scripts, Inc. and Medco or uncertainty around realization of the anticipated benefits of the Merger, including the expected amount and timing of cost savings and operating synergies and difficulty in retaining clients of the respective companies, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations as well as cause a decline of our stock price.The success of the Merger depends, in part, on our ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits from the combination, including synergies, cost savings, innovation and operational efficiencies. If we are unable to fully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits may not be fully realized or at all, and the value of our common stock may decline.The combination of Medco’s business and ESI’s business has been, and will continue to be, a complex, costly and time-consuming process. The ongoing integration of the two companies has resulted, and may continue to result, in challenges, some of which may be material, including, without limitation:•the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business concerns and performance shortfalls at one or both of the companies as a result of the devotion of management’s attention to the completion of the integration•managing a larger combined company•the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process•retaining existing clients and attracting new clients on profitable terms•retaining long-term client relationships which comprise a substantial portion of our revenues•unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems•managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating the operations of the combined company•unforeseen expenses associated with the MergerAny one or more of these factors could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues, diversion of management’s time and energy or other negative impacts on the business. Delays or issues encountered in the ongoing integration process could have a material adverse effect on the revenues, expenses, operating results and financial condition of the combined company and there can be no assurance that we will fully realize these anticipated benefits.Further, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs in connection with the integration process. The substantial majority of these costs are non-recurring expenses related to the facilities and systems consolidation costs. We may also incur other unanticipated integration costs as well as costs to maintain employee morale and additional costs related to formulating and revising integration plans.If, among other things, we are unable to fully achieve the expected growth in earnings, or if our operational cost savings estimates are not fully realized, or if the integration costs are greater than expected, the market price of our common stock may decline. The market price also may decline if we do not fully achieve the perceived benefits of the Merger as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts or if the financial results of the combined company are not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts.Our debt service obligations reduce the funds available for other business purposes, and the terms and covenants relating to our indebtedness could adversely impact our financial performance and liquidity.We currently have debt outstanding (see summary of indebtedness within Note 7 - Financing), including indebtedness of ESI and Medco guaranteed by us. Our debt service obligations reduce the funds available for other business purposes. Increases in interest rates on variable rate indebtedness would increase our interest expense and could materially adversely affect our financial results. At December 31, 2013, we had $2,000.0 million of gross obligations, or $8.6 million net of cash, which were subject to variable rates of interest under our credit agreement. A hypothetical increase in interest rates of 1% would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately $20.0 million (pre-tax), assuming that obligations subject to variable interest rates remained constant.We are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing, such as the insufficiency of cash flow to meet required debt service payment obligations and the inability to refinance existing indebtedness. In addition, certain of our debt instruments contain covenants which include limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, create or permit liens 24Table of Contentson assets, and engage in mergers, consolidations or disposals. The covenants under our credit agreement also include, among others, a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. If we fail to satisfy one or more of the covenants under our credit agreement or the senior notes indentures, we would be in default under the credit agreement and/or the senior notes indentures, and may be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources or otherwise not be able to draw down against our revolving credit facility. Under such circumstances, other sources of capital may not be available to us, or be available only on unattractive terms. See Note 7 - Financing to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II — Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.A delay, reduction, suspension or cancellation of government spending or appropriations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Certain of our revenues are ultimately sourced from government spending and appropriated funds. The failure to provide for continued appropriations or regular ongoing scheduled payments to us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.If we lose our relationship with one or more key pharmaceutical manufacturers, or if the payments made or discounts provided by pharmaceutical manufacturers decline, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.We maintain contractual relationships with numerous pharmaceutical manufacturers which provide us with, among other things:•discounts for drugs we purchase to be dispensed from our home delivery pharmacies•rebates based upon distributions of drugs from our home delivery pharmacies and through pharmacies in our retail networks•administrative fees for managing rebate programs, including the development and maintenance of formularies which include the particular manufacturer’s products•access to limited distribution specialty pharmaceuticalsIf several of these contractual relationships are terminated or materially altered by the pharmaceutical manufacturers or we are otherwise unable to renew such contracts or enter into similar contracts on favorable terms, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, formulary fee programs have been the subject of debate in federal and state legislatures and various other public and governmental forums. Adoption of new laws, rules or regulations or changes in, or new interpretations of, existing laws, rules or regulations, relating to any of these programs could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.Changes in industry pricing benchmarks could materially impact our financial performance.Contracts in the prescription drug industry, including our contracts with retail pharmacy networks and with PBM and specialty pharmacy clients, generally use “average wholesale price” or “AWP,” which is published by a third party as a benchmark to establish pricing for prescription drugs. In the event that AWP is no longer published by third parties or if we adopt other pricing benchmarks for establishing prices within the industry, we can give no assurance that the short- or long-term impact of such changes to industry pricing benchmarks will not have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Legislation and other regulations affecting drug prices are discussed in more detail under “Part I — Item 1 — Business — Government Regulation and Compliance — Legislation and Regulation Affecting Drug Prices” above.Pending and future litigation or other proceedings could subject us to significant monetary damages or penalties and/or require us to change our business practices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.We are subject to risks relating to litigation, enforcement action, regulatory proceedings, government inquiries and investigations and other similar actions in connection with our business operations, including without limitation the dispensing of pharmaceutical products by our specialty and home delivery pharmacies, services rendered in connection with our disease management offering, our pharmaceutical services operations, pharmacy benefit management services and mergers and acquisitions activity. A list of the significant proceedings pending against us is included under “Part I — Item 3 — Legal Proceedings,” including certain proceedings that purport to be class action lawsuits. These proceedings seek unspecified monetary damages and/or equitable relief. While we believe these proceedings are without merit and intend to contest them vigorously, we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any such proceedings. If one or more of these proceedings has an unfavorable outcome, we cannot provide any assurance that it would not have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, including our ability to attract and retain clients as a result of the negative reputational impact of such an 25Table of Contentsoutcome. Further, while certain costs are covered by insurance, we may incur uninsured costs that are material to our financial performance in the defense of such proceedings.Commercial liability insurance coverage continues to be difficult to obtain for companies in our business sector, as such insurance can cause unexpected volatility in premiums and/or retention requirements dictated by insurance carriers. We have established certain self-insurance accruals to cover anticipated losses within our retained liability for previously reported claims and the cost to defend these claims. However, there can be no assurance that such accruals will cover actual losses or that general, professional, managed care errors and omissions, and/or other liability insurance coverage will be reasonably available in the future or such insurance coverage, together with our self-insurance accruals, will be adequate to cover future claims. A claim, or claims, in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.We face significant competition in attracting and retaining talented employees. Further, managing succession and retention for our Chief Executive Officer and other key executives is critical to our success, and our failure to do so could have an adverse impact on our future performance.We believe that our ability to attract and retain a qualified and experienced workforce is essential to meet current and future goals and objectives. There is no guarantee that we will be able to attract and retain such employees or that competition among potential employers will not result in increased salaries or other benefits. An inability to retain existing employees or attract additional employees could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Our failure to adequately plan for succession of our Chief Executive Officer, senior management and other key employees or the failure of key employees to successfully transition into new roles could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. While we have succession plans in place and employment arrangements with certain key executives, these do not guarantee that the services of these executives will continue to be available to us.Item 1B
