In order to grow we need to continue to acquire investment properties.  The acquisition of investment properties may be subject to competitive pressures.
We face competition in the acquisition, operation and sale of property. We expect competition from:
 
·                  Businesses;
·                  Individuals;
·                  Fiduciary accounts and plans; and
·                  Other entities engaged in real estate investment and financing.
 
Some of these competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources. This competition may result in a higher cost for properties we wish to purchase.
 
Negative market conditions or adverse events affecting our existing or potential tenants, or the industries in which they operate, could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract new tenants, re-lease space, collect rent or renew leases, which could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and inhibit growth.
Cash flow from operations depends in part on the ability to lease space to tenants on economically favorable terms. We could be adversely affected by various facts and events over which we have limited or no control, such as:
 
·                  Lack of demand in areas where our properties are located;
·                  Inability to retain existing tenants and attract new tenants;
·                  Oversupply of space and changes in market rental rates;
·                  Declines in our tenants’ creditworthiness and ability to pay rent, which may be affected by their operations, the current economic situation and competition within their industries from other operators;
·                  Defaults by and bankruptcies of tenants, failure of tenants to pay rent on a timely basis, or failure of tenants to comply with their contractual obligations;
·                  Economic or physical decline of the areas where the properties are located; and
·                  Deterioration of physical condition of our properties.
 
At any time, any tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its operating results or overall financial condition. As a result, a tenant may delay lease commencement, fail to make rental payments when due, decline to extend a lease upon its expiration, become insolvent or declare bankruptcy. Any tenant bankruptcy or insolvency, leasing delay or failure to make rental payments when due could result in the termination of the tenant’s lease and material losses to us.
 
If tenants do not renew their leases as they expire, we may not be able to rent or sell the properties.  Furthermore, leases that are renewed, and some new leases for properties that are re-leased, may have terms that are less economically favorable than expiring lease terms, or may require us to incur significant costs, such as renovations, tenant improvements or lease transaction costs. Negative market conditions may cause us to sell vacant properties for less than their carrying value, which could result in impairments. Any of these events could adversely affect cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to shareholders and service indebtedness. A significant portion of the costs of owning property, such as real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance, are not necessarily reduced when circumstances cause a decrease in rental revenue from the properties. In a weakened financial condition, tenants may not be able to pay these costs of ownership and we may be unable to recover these operating expenses from them.
 
Further, the occurrence of a tenant bankruptcy or insolvency could diminish the income we receive from the tenant’s lease or leases. In addition, a bankruptcy court might authorize the tenant to terminate its leases with us. If that happens, our claim against the bankrupt tenant for unpaid future rent would be subject to statutory limitations that most likely would result in rent payments that would be substantially less than the remaining rent we are owed under the leases or we may elect not to pursue claims against the tenant for terminated leases. In addition, any claim we have for unpaid past rent, if any, may not be paid in full, or at all. Moreover, in the case of a tenant’s leases that are not terminated as a result of its bankruptcy, we may be required or elect to reduce the rent payable under those leases or provide other concessions, reducing amounts we receive under those leases. As a result, tenant bankruptcies may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  Any of these events could adversely affect cash from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and service indebtedness.

Eighty-four of our properties were available for lease or sale at December 31, 2012, all but one of which were single-tenant properties. At December 31, 2012, 32 of our properties under lease were unoccupied and available for sublease by the tenants, all of which were current with their rent and other obligations. During 2012, each of our tenants accounted for less than 10% of our rental revenue.
 
For the fourth quarter of 2012, our tenants in the “convenience stores” industry accounted for 14.9% of our rental revenue. A downturn in this industry, whether nationwide or limited to specific sectors of the United States, could adversely affect tenants in this industry, which in turn could have a material adverse affect on our financial position, results of operations and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock.
 
We believe that the ongoing economic recession has also had an adverse effect on many casual dining restaurants.  The impact of bankruptcy filings by any tenants in the casual dining industry could adversely affect us. Individually, each of the other industries in our property portfolio accounted for less than 10% of our rental revenue for the fourth quarter of 2012. Nevertheless, downturns in these other industries could also adversely affect our tenants, which in turn could also have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common and preferred stock.  In addition, we may in the future make additional investments in the “convenience stores” industry, which would increase this industry’s percentage of our rental revenues, thereby increasing the effect that such a downturn in this industry would have on us.
 
In addition, a substantial number of our properties are leased to middle-market retail and other commercial enterprises that generally have more limited financial and other resources than certain upper-market retail and other commercial enterprises, and therefore, they are more likely to be adversely affected by a downturn in their respective businesses or in the regional, national or international economy.
 
Furthermore, we have made and may continue to make selected acquisitions of properties that fall outside our historical focus on freestanding, single-tenant, net-lease retail locations in the United States. We may be exposed to a variety of new risks by expanding into new property types and/or new jurisdictions outside the United States and properties leased to tenants engaged in non-retail businesses. These risks may include a limited knowledge and understanding of the industry in which the tenant operates, limited experience in managing certain types of new properties, new types of real estate locations and lease structures, and the laws and culture of any non-U.S. jurisdiction.
 
The acquisition of American Realty Capital Trust, Inc. presents certain risks to our business and operations.
On January 22, 2013, we completed our acquisition of American Realty Capital Trust, Inc., or ARCT, in a transaction valued at approximately $3.1 billion.  Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the agreement, at the effective time of the acquisition, each outstanding share of ARCT common stock was converted into $0.35 of cash and 0.2874 shares of our common stock.  In connection with the acquisition, we paid $552.9 million at closing to repay amounts then outstanding and terminated the commitments under ARCT’s revolving credit facility. In conjunction with our acquisition of ARCT in January 2013, we assumed approximately $516.3 million of mortgages payable.  With this acquisition, we added 515 properties to our portfolio.
 
The acquisition presents certain risks to our business and operations, including, among other things, the following:
 
·                  We may encounter difficulties and incur substantial expenses in integrating ARCT’s properties and systems into our operations and systems and, in any event, the integration may require a substantial amount of time on the part of both our management and employees and therefore divert their attention from other aspects of our business;

·                  ARCT’s real estate portfolio includes a number of industries which are new to us, including U.S. General Services Administration assets, as well as tenants in the aerospace, financial services, freight, health care, home maintenance, manufacturing, pharmacy, retail banking, technology and telecommunications businesses;
 
·                  We may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of ARCT, or those benefits may be less than we and securities and industry analysts had anticipated, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, preferred stock and debt securities;
 
·                  Our level of indebtedness has increased in conjunction with the acquisition of ARCT;
 
·                  Our future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded portfolio;
 
·                  The market price of our common stock, preferred stock and debt securities may decline, particularly if we do not achieve the perceived benefits of the ARCT acquisition as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by securities or industry analysts or if the effect of the acquisition on our results of operations and financial condition is not consistent with the expectations of these analysts;
 
·                  We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue paying dividends on our common stock or preferred stock at the current rates;
 
·                  If ARCT failed to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Realty Income may inherit significant tax liabilities, and Realty Income could lose its REIT status should disqualifying activities continue after the acquisition;
 
·                  We may incur unanticipated capital expenditures in order to maintain or improve the properties and businesses of ARCT;
 
·                  We may encounter difficulties in managing a substantially larger and more complex business with properties in new geographic areas;
 
·                  Many of ARCT’s tenants operated in industries where we do not have any prior experience, which may make it difficult for us to evaluate their business and operations, and the ARCT acquisition increased our tenant concentration in certain industries;
 
·                  We may need to implement or improve internal controls, procedures, policies and systems with respect to ARCT’s properties and businesses, which may require substantial time and expenditure;
 
·                  We may continue to incur substantial expenses related to the acquisition, including legal, accounting, and financial advisory expenses;
 
·                  We may be required to recognize write-offs, impairment charges or amortization charges resulting from the ARCT acquisition; and
 
·                  We may encounter unanticipated or unknown liabilities relating to the acquired businesses and properties.
 
In addition, eight lawsuits were filed in conjunction with the acquisition of ARCT.  All of the below actions name as defendants ARCT, members of the ARCT board of directors, Realty Income, and Tau Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Realty Income, or Merger Sub. In each case, the plaintiffs allege that the ARCT directors breached their fiduciary duties to ARCT and/or its stockholders in negotiating and approving the agreement, that the acquisition consideration negotiated in the agreement improperly values ARCT, that the ARCT stockholders will not receive fair value for their ARCT common stock in the acquisition, and that the terms of the agreement impose improper deal-protection devices that purportedly preclude competing offers. The complaints further allege that Realty Income, Merger Sub, and, in some cases, ARCT aided and abetted those alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. The various amended complaints add allegations that disclosures regarding the merger in the joint proxy statement/prospectus filed on October 1, 2012, or the definitive proxy statement/prospectus filed on December 6, 2012, are inadequate. Plaintiffs seek

injunctive relief, including enjoining or rescinding the acquisition, and an award of other unspecified attorneys’ and other fees and costs, in addition to other relief.  Realty Income believes that these actions have no merit and intends to respond to them in due course:
 
Maryland Actions. Since the announcement of the proposed acquisition of ARCT on September 6, 2012, six alleged class actions and/or shareholder derivative actions were filed on behalf of alleged ARCT stockholders and/or ARCT itself in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland, under the following captions: Quaal v. American Realty Capital Trust Inc., et al., No. 24-C-12-005306, filed September 7, 2012; Hill v. American Realty Capital Trust, Inc., et al., No. 24-C-12-005502, filed September 19, 2012; Goldwurm v. American Realty Capital Trust, Inc., et al., No. 24-C-12-005524, filed September 20, 2012; Gordon v. Schorsch, et al., No. 24-C-12-005571, filed September 21, 2012; Gregor v. Kahane, et al., No. 24-C-12-005563, filed September 21, 2012; and Rooker v. American Realty Capital Trust, Inc., et al., No. 24-C-12-005924, filed October 5, 2012. On October 23, 2012, defendants moved to dismiss the actions and, on November 8, 2012, moved to stay discovery pending disposition of the motions to dismiss. On November 13, 2012, all plaintiffs except Sydelle Goldwurm filed motions to compel discovery and to expedite discovery. On November 16, 2012, the court consolidated the actions into a single action captioned In re American Capital Realty Trust, Inc. Shareholder Litigation, No. 24-C-12-005306 (the “Maryland State Action”).  On November 21, 2012, the court appointed plaintiff Randell Quaal as lead plaintiff and Brower Piven, P.C. as lead counsel for plaintiffs. On December 3, 2012, plaintiff Goldwurm voluntarily dismissed her action in Maryland state court without prejudice. On December 11, 2012, plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction and to compel expedited discovery. On December 13, 2012, the court granted defendants’ motion to stay discovery and denied plaintiffs’ motion to expedite discovery. On December 14, 2012, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint, and defendants filed amended motions to dismiss the amended complaint on December 21, 2012.
 
On January 6, 2013, the parties in the Maryland State Action entered into a memorandum of understanding regarding settlement of all claims asserted on behalf of the alleged class of ARCT stockholders. In connection with the settlement contemplated by the memorandum of understanding, the Maryland State Action and all claims asserted in the litigation will be dismissed, subject to court approval. The proposed settlement terms required ARCT to make certain additional disclosures related to the merger, as set forth in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by ARCT on January 8, 2013. The parties also agreed that plaintiffs may seek attorneys’ fees and costs in an as-yet undetermined amount, with ARCT to pay such fees and costs if and to the extent they are approved by the Maryland state court. The memorandum of understanding further contemplates that the parties will enter into a stipulation of settlement, which will be subject to customary conditions, including confirmatory discovery and court approval following notice to ARCT’s stockholders. If the parties enter into a stipulation of settlement, a hearing will be scheduled at which the court will consider the fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy of the settlement. There can be no assurance that the parties will ultimately enter into a stipulation of settlement, that the court will approve any proposed settlement, or that any eventual settlement will be under the same terms as those contemplated by the memorandum of understanding.
 
After the Maryland state court denied plaintiff Goldwurm’s motion for appointment of lead plaintiff and lead counsel in the Maryland State Action, plaintiff Goldwurm filed a class action and shareholder derivative action on November 29, 2012, in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, captioned Goldwurm v. American Realty Capital Trust, Inc., et al., No. 1:12-cv-03516-JKB (the “Maryland Federal Action”). On December 12, 2012, plaintiff Goldwurm moved for expedited discovery. Defendants moved to stay the federal case on December 13, 2012, and moved to dismiss it on December 19, 2012. On January 11, 2013, plaintiff Goldwurm moved for a temporary restraining order seeking to enjoin the shareholder vote on the proposed merger set to take place on January 16, 2013.
 
On January 14, 2013, the parties in the Maryland Federal Action entered into an agreement to settle all claims.  In connection with the settlement, on January 25, 2013, the parties agreed to voluntarily dismiss the case with prejudice.  On January 28, 2013, the Maryland federal court dismissed the action.
 
New York Actions. Two alleged class actions were filed on behalf of alleged ARCT stockholders in the Supreme Court of the State of New York for New York, New York, under the following captions: The Carol L. Possehl Living Trust v. American Realty Capital Trust, Inc., et al., No. 653300-2012, filed September 20, 2012; and Salenger v. American Realty Capital Trust, Inc. et al., No. 353355-2012, filed September 25, 2012. On October 19, 2012, the court consolidated the actions into a single action captioned In re American Realty Capital Trust Shareholders Litigation, No. 653300-2012 (the “New York Action”) and appointed Robbins Geller Rudman

& Dowd LLP as lead counsel for plaintiffs. On October 19, 2012, defendants moved for a stay of proceedings. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on October 23, 2012. On November 9, 2012, the Court granted defendants’ motion to stay the New York Action pending the Maryland state actions.
 
As a property owner, we may be subject to unknown environmental liabilities.
Investments in real property can create a potential for environmental liability. An owner of property can face liability for environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property. We can face such liability regardless of:
 
·                  Our knowledge of the contamination;
·                  The timing of the contamination;
·                  The cause of the contamination; or
·                  The party responsible for the contamination of the property.
 
There may be environmental problems associated with our properties of which we are unaware. In that regard, a number of our properties are leased to operators of convenience stores that sell petroleum-based fuels, as well as to operators of oil change and tune-up facilities and operators that use chemicals and other waste products. These facilities, and some other of our properties, use, or may have used in the past, underground lifts or underground tanks for the storage of petroleum-based or waste products, which could create a potential for the release of hazardous substances.
 
The presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to lease or sell that property and we may incur substantial remediation costs. Although our leases generally require our tenants to operate in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from the tenants’ activities on the property, we could nevertheless be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest. There also can be no assurance that our tenants could or would satisfy their indemnification obligations under their leases. The discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, our financial condition or our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness.
 
In addition, several of our properties were built during the period when asbestos was commonly used in building construction and other buildings with asbestos may be acquired by us in the future. Environmental laws govern the presence, maintenance and removal of asbestos-containing materials, or ACMs, and require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, that they adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers.
 
It is also possible that some of our properties may contain or develop harmful mold, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediation of the problem. When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing, as exposure to mold may cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. As a result, should our tenants or their employees or customers be exposed to mold at any of our properties we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected property, which would reduce our cash available for distribution. In addition, exposure to mold by our tenants or others could expose us to liability if property damage or health concerns arise.
 
Compliance.  We have not been notified by any governmental authority, and are not otherwise aware, of any material noncompliance, liability or claim relating to hazardous substances, toxic substances, or petroleum products in connection with any of our properties. In addition, we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all present federal, state and local laws relating to ACMs. Nevertheless, if environmental contamination should exist, we could be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest.

Insurance and Indemnity.  In July 2012, we entered into a ten-year environmental insurance policy which expires in July 2022 and replaced our previous seven-year environmental insurance policy. The limits on our current policy are $10 million per occurrence and $60 million in the aggregate.  The limits on the excess policy are $5 million per occurrence and $10 million in the aggregate.  Therefore, the primary and excess ten-year policies together provide a total limit of $15 million per occurrence and $70 million in the aggregate.
 
It is possible that our insurance could be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation and that, in the future, we could be unable to obtain insurance for environmental matters at a reasonable cost, or at all. Our tenants are generally responsible for, and indemnify us against, liabilities for environmental matters that occur on our properties.  For properties that have underground storage tanks, in addition to providing an indemnity in our favor, the tenants generally obtain environmental insurance or rely upon the state funds in the states where these properties are located to reimburse tenants for environmental remediation.
 
If we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust, the amount of dividends we are able to pay would decrease, which could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and could adversely affect the value of our debt securities.
Commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1994, we believe that we have been organized and have operated, and we intend to continue to operate, so as to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code. However, we cannot assure you that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that has satisfied the requirements for qualification as a REIT, or that we will continue to be organized or operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a REIT.
 
Qualification as a REIT involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements under highly technical and complex Code provisions, for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations, as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control.
 
For example, in order to qualify as a REIT, at least 95% of our gross income in each year must be derived from qualifying sources, and we must pay distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income (excluding net capital gains).
 
In the future, it is possible that legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a REIT, or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification.
 
If we fail to satisfy all of the requirements for qualification as a REIT, we may be subject to certain penalty taxes or, in some circumstances, we may fail to qualify as a REIT.  If we were to fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year:
 
·                  We would be required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates;
·                  We would not be allowed a deduction in computing our taxable income for amounts distributed to our stockholders;
·                  We could be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost;
·                  We would no longer be required to make distributions to stockholders; and
·                  This treatment would substantially reduce amounts available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability for the years involved, which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities.
 
Even if we qualify for and maintain our REIT status, we may be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. For example, if we have net income from a prohibited transaction, that income will be subject to a 100% tax. In addition, our taxable REIT subsidiaries, including Crest, are subject to federal and state taxes at the applicable tax rates on their income and property.

Table of Contents
 
Distributions requirements imposed by law limit our flexibility.
To maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we generally are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income, excluding net capital gains, each year. We also are subject to tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our taxable income (including net capital gains) each year.
 
In addition, we are subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax to the extent that we fail to distribute during any calendar year at least the sum of 85% of our ordinary income for that calendar year, 95% of our capital gain net income for the calendar year, and any amount of that income that was not distributed in prior years.
 
We intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the distribution requirements of the Code as well as to reduce our exposure to federal income taxes and the nondeductible excise tax. Differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses to arrive at taxable income, along with the effect of required debt amortization payments, could require us to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a REIT.
 
Future issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our common stock.
Our future growth will depend, in large part, upon our ability to raise additional capital. If we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities, we could dilute the interests of holders of our common stock. The interests of our common stockholders could also be diluted by the issuance of shares of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding options or pursuant to stock incentive plans. Likewise, our Board of Directors is authorized to cause us to issue preferred stock of any class or series (with dividend, voting and other rights as determined by the Board of Directors). Accordingly, the Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting, dividend and other similar rights that could dilute, or otherwise adversely affect, the interest of holders of our common stock.
 
We are subject to risks associated with debt and capital stock financing.
We intend to incur additional indebtedness in the future, including borrowings under our $1 billion acquisition credit facility. At December 31, 2012, we had $158 million of outstanding borrowings under our acquisition credit facility, a total of $2.55 billion of outstanding unsecured senior debt securities and $175.9 million of outstanding mortgage debt. To the extent that new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase. As a result, we are and will be subject to risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments on our debt. We also face variable interest rate risk as the interest rate on our acquisition credit facility is variable and could therefore increase over time.  We also face the risk that we may be unable to refinance or repay our debt as it comes due. Given past disruptions in the financial markets and the ongoing global financial crisis (which includes concerns that certain European countries may be unable to repay their national debt), we also face the risk that one or more of the participants in our acquisition credit facility may not be able to lend us money.
 
In addition, our acquisition credit facility contains provisions that could limit or, in certain cases, prohibit the payment of distributions on our common stock and preferred stock.  In particular, our acquisition credit facility provides that, if an event of default (as defined in the credit facility) exists, neither we nor any of our subsidiaries may make any distributions on (except distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the shareholders of that class), or repurchase or redeem, among other things, any shares of our common stock or preferred stock, during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters in an aggregate amount in excess of the greater of:
 
·                  The sum of (a) 95% of our adjusted funds from operations (as defined by the credit facility agreement) for that period plus (b) the aggregate amount of cash distributions on our preferred stock for that period, and
·                  The minimum amount of cash distributions required to be made to our shareholders in order to maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes,
 
except that we may repurchase or redeem preferred stock with the net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock or preferred stock. The acquisition credit facility further provides that, in the event of a failure to pay principal, interest or any other amount payable thereunder when due or upon the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to us or with respect to any of our subsidiaries
 
-28-






Table of Contents
 
that have guaranteed amounts payable under the credit facility or that meet a significance test set forth in the credit facility, we and our subsidiaries may not pay any distributions on (except distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the shareholders of that class), or repurchase or redeem, among other things, any shares of our common stock or preferred stock.  If any such event of default under our acquisition credit facility were to occur, it would likely have a material adverse effect on the market price of our outstanding common and preferred stock and on the market value of our debt securities, could limit the amount of distributions payable on our common stock and preferred stock or prevent us from paying those distributions altogether, and may adversely affect our ability to qualify, or prevent us from qualifying, as a REIT.
 
Our indebtedness could also have other important consequences to holders of our common and preferred stock, including:
 
·                  Increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
·                  Limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements;
·                  Requiring the use of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures and general corporate requirements;
·                  Limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and
·                  Putting us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness.
 
If we default under a mortgage loan, we will automatically be in default of any other loan that has cross-default provisions, and we may lose the properties securing these loans.
 
Our business operations may not generate the cash needed to make distributions on our capital stock or to service our indebtedness.
Our ability to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock and payments on our indebtedness, and to fund planned acquisitions and capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future.  We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock, to pay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs.
 
The market value of our capital stock and debt securities could be substantially affected by various factors.
The market value of our capital stock and debt securities will depend on many factors, which may change from time to time, including:
 
·                  Prevailing interest rates, increases in which may have an adverse effect on the market value of our capital stock and debt securities;
·                  The market for similar securities issued by other REITs;
·                 General economic and financial market conditions;
·                  The financial condition, performance and prospects of us, our tenants and our competitors;
·                  Changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts with respect to us, our competitors or our industry;
·                  Changes in our credit ratings; and
·                  Actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results of us and our competitors.
 
In addition, over the last several years, prices of common stock and debt securities in the U.S. trading markets have been experiencing extreme price fluctuations, and the market values of our common stock and debt securities have also fluctuated significantly during this period. As a result of these and other factors, investors who purchase our capital stock and debt securities may experience a decrease, which could be substantial and rapid, in the market value of our capital stock and debt securities, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects.

Real estate ownership is subject to particular economic conditions that may have a negative impact on our revenue.
We are subject to all of the inherent risks associated with the ownership of real estate.  In particular, we face the risk that rental revenue from our properties may be insufficient to cover all corporate operating expenses, debt service payments on indebtedness we incur and distributions on our capital stock. Additional real estate ownership risks include:
 



·    

Adverse changes in general or   local economic conditions;       


·    

Changes in supply of, or demand   for, similar or competing properties;       


·    

Changes in interest rates and   operating expenses;       


·    

Competition for tenants;       


·    

Changes in market rental rates;       


·    

Inability to lease properties upon   termination of existing leases;       


·    

Renewal of leases at lower rental   rates;       


·    

Inability to collect rents from   tenants due to financial hardship, including bankruptcy;       


·    

Changes in tax, real estate,   zoning and environmental laws that may have an adverse impact upon the value   of real estate;       


·    

Uninsured property liability;       


·    

Property damage or casualty   losses;       


·    

Unexpected expenditures for   capital improvements or to bring properties into compliance with applicable   federal, state and local laws;       


·    

The need to periodically renovate   and repair our properties;       


·    

Physical or weather-related damage   to properties;       


·    

The potential risk of functional   obsolescence of properties over time;       


·    

Acts of terrorism and war; and       


·    

Acts of God and other factors   beyond the control of our management.         
 
An uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the policy limits on our properties could subject us to lost capital or revenue on those properties.
Under the terms and conditions of the leases currently in force on our properties, tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons, air, water, land or property, due to activities conducted on the properties, except for claims arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of us or our agents. Additionally, tenants are generally required, at the tenant’s expense, to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease, liability and property damage insurance policies. The insurance policies our tenants are required to maintain for property damage are generally in amounts not less than the full replacement cost of the improvements less slab, foundations, supports and other customarily excluded improvements. Our tenants are generally required to maintain general liability coverage varying between $1,000,000 and $10,000,000 depending on the tenant and the industry in which the tenant operates.
 
In addition to the indemnities and required insurance policies identified above, many of our properties are also covered by flood and earthquake insurance policies (subject to substantial deductibles) obtained and paid for by the tenants as part of their risk management programs. Additionally, we have obtained blanket liability, flood and earthquake (subject to substantial deductibles) and property damage insurance policies to protect us and our properties against loss should the indemnities and insurance policies provided by the tenants fail to restore the properties to their condition prior to a loss. However, should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above, or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy, we could lose all or part of our capital invested in, and anticipated revenue from, one or more of the properties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. Given the recent disruptions in the insurance industry, we also face the risk that our insurance carriers may not be able to provide payment under any potential claims that might arise under the terms of our insurance policies, and we may not have the ability to purchase insurance policies we desire.

Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and fire, safety, and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures that could adversely impact our results of operations.
Our properties are generally required to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the ADA. The ADA has separate compliance requirements for “public accommodations” and “commercial facilities,” but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities. Compliance with the ADA requirements could require removal of access barriers and non-compliance could result in imposition of fines by the U.S. government or an award of damages to private litigants. The retailers to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ADA provisions, and we believe that these retailers may be obligated to cover costs associated with compliance. If required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated, or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated, the ability of these retailers to cover costs could be adversely affected and we could be required to expend our own funds to comply with the provisions of the ADA, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. In addition, we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations, building codes and other land use regulations, as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties. We may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders.
 
Property taxes may increase without notice.
The real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we develop or acquire in the future may increase as property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities.
 
We depend on key personnel.
We depend on the efforts of our executive officers and key employees. The loss of the services of our executive officers and key employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. It is possible that we will not be able to recruit additional personnel with equivalent experience in the net-lease industry.
 
Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the value of our debt and equity securities, the markets in which we operate and our results of operations.
Terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations, the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities. There can be no assurance that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the United States or U.S. businesses. These attacks, or armed conflicts, may directly impact our physical facilities or the businesses of our tenants.
 
If events like these were to occur, they could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the U.S. and worldwide financial markets and economy. They also could result in or prolong an economic recession in the U.S. or abroad. Any of these occurrences could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and revenues and on the market price of our capital stock and on the value of our debt securities. It could also have an adverse effect on our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt securities or other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders.
 
Disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of our common stock.
Over the last several years, the United States stock and credit markets have experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which have caused market prices of many stocks and debt securities to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. In addition, the ongoing global financial crisis (which includes concerns that certain European countries may be unable to pay their national debt) has had a similar effect. These circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets, making terms for certain financings less attractive, and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of financing. Unrest in certain Middle Eastern countries and resultant fluctuation in petroleum prices have added to the uncertainty in the capital markets.  Continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing at

reasonable terms, which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions. A prolonged downturn in the stock or credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly. In addition, these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell, as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of financing or difficulties in obtaining financing. These events in the stock and credit markets may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock or preferred stock or debt securities. These disruptions in the financial markets also may have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, the income we receive from our properties and the lease rates we can charge for our properties, as well as other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy in general.
 
Inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Although inflation has not materially impacted our results of operations in the recent past, increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on any variable rate debt we incur in the future and on our results of operations. During times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, as provided for in our leases, rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation. Likewise, even though net leases reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation, substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue, which may adversely affect the tenants’ ability to pay rent.
 
Current volatility in market and economic conditions may impact the accuracy of the various estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and footnotes to the financial statements.
Various estimates are used in the preparation of our financial statements, including estimates related to asset and liability valuations (or potential impairments), and various receivables. Often these estimates require the use of market data values which are currently difficult to assess, as well as estimates of future performance or receivables collectability which can also be difficult to accurately predict. Although management believes it has been prudent and used reasonable judgment in making these estimates, it is possible that actual results may differ from these estimates.
 
Changes in accounting standards may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.
The SEC is currently considering whether issuers in the U.S. should be required to prepare financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS, instead of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.  IFRS is a comprehensive set of accounting standards promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board, or IASB, which are rapidly gaining worldwide acceptance.  If the SEC decides to require IFRS, it expects that U.S. issuers would first report under the new standards beginning in approximately 2015 or later, although the timeframe has not been finalized.  Additionally, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, is considering various changes to GAAP, some of which may be significant, as part of a joint effort with the IASB to converge accounting standards.  Although the FASB and IASB currently have a project on their agenda to examine the accounting for leases, the project may not result in the issuance of a final standard or a standard that would be comparable to current GAAP.  If IFRS is adopted, the potential issues associated with lease accounting, along with other potential changes associated with the adoption or convergence with IFRS, may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.
