.    Risk FactorsAn investment in Harley-Davidson, Inc. involves risks, including those discussed below. These risk factors should be considered carefully before deciding whether to invest in the Company.•The Company may not be able to successfully execute its long-term business strategy. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to drive growth to the extent desired through its focus of efforts and resources on its long-term business strategy and the Harley-Davidson brand or to enhance productivity and profitability to the extent desired through pricing and continuous improvement.•Changes in general economic conditions, tightening of credit, political events or other factors may adversely impact dealers’ retail sales. The motorcycle industry is impacted by general economic conditions over which motorcycle manufacturers have little control. These factors can weaken the retail environment and lead to weaker demand for discretionary purchases such as motorcycles. Tightening of credit can limit the availability of funds from financial institutions and other lenders and sources of capital which could adversely affect the ability of retail consumers to obtain loans for the purchase of motorcycles from lenders, including HDFS. Should general economic conditions or motorcycle industry demand decline, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition may be substantially adversely affected. The motorcycle industry can also be affected by political conditions and other factors over which motorcycle manufacturers have little control.•The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. The Company sells its products internationally and in most markets those sales are made in the foreign country’s local currency. As a result, a weakening in those foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar can adversely affect the Company's revenue and margin, and cause volatility in results of operations. The Company is also subject to risks associated with changes in prices of commodities. Earnings from the Company’s financial services business are affected by changes in interest rates. Although the Company uses derivative financial instruments to some extent to attempt to manage a portion of its exposure to foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, the Company 10does not attempt to manage its entire expected exposure, and these instruments generally do not extend beyond one year and may expose the Company to credit risk in the event of counterparty default to the derivative financial instruments. There can be no assurance that in the future the Company will successfully manage these risks.•The Company sells its products at wholesale and must rely on a network of independent dealers to manage the retail distribution of its products. The Company depends on the capability of its independent dealers to develop and implement effective retail sales plans to create demand among retail purchasers for the motorcycles and related products and services that the dealers purchase from the Company. If the Company’s independent dealers are not successful in these endeavors, then the Company will be unable to maintain or grow its revenues and meet its financial expectations. Further, independent dealers may experience difficulty in funding their day-to-day cash flow needs and paying their obligations resulting from adverse business conditions such as weakened retail sales and tightened credit. If dealers are unsuccessful, they may exit or be forced to exit the business or, in some cases, the Company may seek to terminate relationships with certain dealerships. As a result, the Company could face additional adverse consequences related to the termination of dealer relationships. Additionally, liquidating a former dealer’s inventory of new and used motorcycles can add downward pressure on new and used motorcycle prices. Further, the unplanned loss of any of the Company’s independent dealers may lead to inadequate market coverage for retail sales of new motorcycles and for servicing previously sold motorcycles, create negative impressions of the Company with its retail customers, and adversely impact the Company’s ability to collect wholesale receivables that are associated with that dealer.•A cybersecurity breach may adversely affect the Company’s reputation, revenue and earnings. The Company and certain of its third-party service providers and vendors receive, store, and transmit digital personal information in connection with the Company’s human resources operations, financial services operations, e-commerce, the Harley Owners Group, dealer management, and other aspects of its business. The Company’s information systems, and those of its third-party service providers and vendors, are vulnerable to the increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to these systems or the information the Company and its third-party service providers and vendors maintain and use through fraud or other means of deceiving our employees and third-party service providers and vendors. Hardware, software or applications the Company develops or obtains from third-parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security and/or the Company’s operations. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect. The Company has implemented and regularly reviews and updates processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of secured data and to prevent data loss. However, the ever-evolving threats mean the Company and third-party service providers and vendors must continually evaluate and adapt systems and processes, and there is no guarantee that they will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches or misuses of data. The Company has experienced information security attacks, but to date they have not compromised the Company’s computing environment or resulted in a material impact on the Company’s business or operations or the release of confidential information about employees, customers, dealers, suppliers or other third parties. Any future significant compromise or breach of the Company’s data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of customer, employee, dealer, supplier or Company data could result in disruption to the Company’s operations, significant costs, lost sales, fines and lawsuits, and/or damage to the Company’s reputation. In addition, as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, with new and evolving requirements, compliance could also result in the Company being required to incur additional costs. •The Company’s marketing strategy of appealing to and growing sales to multi-generational and multi-cultural customers worldwide may not continue to be successful. The Company has been successful in marketing its products in large part by promoting the experience of Harley-Davidson motorcycling. To sustain and grow the business over the long-term, the Company must continue to be successful selling products and promoting the experience of motorcycling to both core customers and outreach customers such as women, young adults and ethnically diverse adults. The Company must also execute its multi-generational and multi-cultural strategy without adversely impacting the strength of the brand with core customers. Failure to successfully drive demand for the Company's products may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and results of operations.•The Company’s ability to remain competitive is dependent upon its capability to develop and successfully introduce new, innovative and compliant products. The motorcycle market continues to change in terms of styling preferences and advances in new technology and, at the same time, be subject to increasing regulations related to safety and emissions. The Company must continue to distinguish its products from its competitors’ products with unique styling and new technologies. As the Company incorporates new and different features and technology into its products, the Company must protect its intellectual property from imitators and ensure its products do not infringe the intellectual property of other companies. In addition, these new products must comply with applicable regulations 11worldwide and satisfy the potential demand for products that produce lower emissions and achieve better fuel economy. The Company must make product advancements while maintaining the classic look, sound and feel associated with Harley-Davidson products. The Company must also be able to design and manufacture these products and deliver them to a global marketplace in an efficient and timely manner. There can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in these endeavors or that existing and prospective customers will like or want the Company’s new products.•Expanding international sales and operations subjects the Company to risks that may have a material adverse effect on its business. Expanding international sales and operations is a part of the Company’s long-term business strategy. To support that strategy, the Company must increase its presence outside the U.S., including additional employees and investment in business infrastructure and operations. International operations and sales are subject to various risks, including political and economic instability, local labor market conditions, the imposition of foreign tariffs and other trade barriers, the impact of foreign government laws and regulations and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to international operations, and the effects of income and withholding taxes, governmental expropriation and differences in business practices. The Company may incur increased costs and experience delays or disruptions in product deliveries and payments in connection with international operations and sales that could cause loss of revenues and earnings. Unfavorable changes in the political, regulatory and business climate could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s net sales, financial condition, profitability or cash flows. Violations of laws that apply to the Company's foreign operations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, could result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt the Company's business and result in an adverse effect on the Company's reputation, business and results of operations.•Retail sales of the Company's independent dealers may be impacted by weather. The Company has observed that abnormally cold and/or wet conditions in a region could have the effect of reducing demand or changing the timing for purchases of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Reduced demand for new Harley-Davidson motorcycles ultimately leads to reduced shipments by the Company.•Retail sales of new motorcycles by the Company’s independent dealers may be adversely impacted by increased supply of and/or declining prices for used motorcycles and excess supply of new motorcycles. The Company has observed that when prices for used Harley-Davidson motorcycles have declined, it can have the effect of reducing demand among retail purchasers for new Harley-Davidson motorcycles (at or near manufacturer’s suggested retail prices). Further, the Company and its independent dealers can and do take actions that influence the markets for new and used motorcycles. For example, introduction of new motorcycle models with significantly different functionality, technology or other customer satisfiers can result in increased supply of used motorcycles, and a decrease in the inventory of used motorcycles available for sale at Harley-Davidson dealers in the U.S. may result in an increased supply or decreased demand in the market for used Harley-Davidson-branded motorcycles, which could result in declining prices for used motorcycles, and prior model-year new motorcycles. Also, while the Company has taken steps designed to balance production volumes for its new motorcycles with demand, those steps may not be effective, or the Company’s competitors could choose to supply new motorcycles to the market in excess of demand at reduced prices which could also have the effect of reducing demand for new Harley-Davidson motorcycles (at or near manufacturer’s suggested retail prices). Ultimately, reduced demand among retail purchasers for new Harley-Davidson motorcycles leads to reduced shipments by the Company.•The Company must comply with governmental laws and regulations that are subject to change and involve significant costs. The Company’s sales and operations in areas outside the U.S. may be subject to foreign laws, regulations and the legal systems of foreign courts or tribunals. These laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies may result in increased costs or restrictions on the ability of the Company to sell its products in certain countries. The Company’s international sales operations may also be adversely affected by U.S. laws affecting foreign trade and taxation.The Company’s domestic sales and operations are subject to governmental policies and regulatory actions of agencies of the United States Government, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), SEC, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Department of Labor and Federal Trade Commission. In addition, the Company’s sales and operations are also subject to laws and actions of state legislatures and other local regulators, including dealer statutes and licensing laws. Changes in regulations or the imposition of additional regulations may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations.12Tax - The Company is subject to income and non-income based taxes in the U.S. and in various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the Company's worldwide income tax liabilities and other tax liabilities. The Company believes that it complies with applicable tax law. If the governing tax authorities have a different interpretation of the applicable law or if there is a change in tax law, the Company's financial condition and/or results of operations may be adversely affected.Environmental - The Company’s motorcycle products use internal combustion engines. These motorcycle products are subject to statutory and regulatory requirements governing emissions and noise, including standards imposed by the EPA, state regulatory agencies, such as California Air Resources Board, and regulatory agencies in certain foreign countries where the Company’s motorcycle products are sold. The Company is also subject to statutory and regulatory requirements governing emissions and noise in the conduct of the Company’s manufacturing operations. Any significant change to the regulatory requirements governing emissions and noise may substantially increase the cost of manufacturing the Company’s products. If the Company fails to meet existing or new requirements, then the Company may be unable to sell certain products or may be subject to fines or penalties. Further, in response to concerns about global climate changes and related changes in consumer preferences, the Company may face greater regulatory or customer pressure to develop products that generate less emissions. This may require the Company to spend additional funds on research, product development, and implementation costs and subject the Company to the risk that the Company’s competitors may respond to these pressures in a manner that gives them a competitive advantage. Financial Services - The Company’s financial services operations are governed by various foreign, federal and state laws that more specifically affect general financial and lending institutions. The financial services operations originate the majority of its consumer loans through its subsidiary, Eaglemark Savings Bank, a Nevada state thrift chartered as an industrial loan company. Congress has previously considered and may in the future impose additional regulation and supervision over the financial services industry. Depending on the provisions of the applicable laws and regulations, the interpretation of laws and regulations and the specific facts and circumstances involved, violations of or non-compliance with these laws may limit the ability of HDFS to collect all or part of the principal or interest on applicable loans, may entitle the borrower to rescind the loan or obtain a refund of amounts previously paid, could subject HDFS to payment of damages or penalties and administrative sanctions, including "cease and desist" orders, and could limit the number of loans eligible for HDFS securitizations programs. Such regulatory requirements and associated supervision could limit the discretion of HDFS in operating its business. Noncompliance with applicable statutes or regulations could result in the suspension or revocation of any charter, license or registration at issue, as well as the imposition of civil fines, criminal penalties and administrative sanctions. The Company cannot assure that the applicable laws or regulations will not be amended or construed in ways that are adverse to HDFS, that new laws and regulations will not be adopted in the future, or that laws and regulations will not attempt to limit the interest rates charged by HDFS, any of which may adversely affect the business of HDFS or its results of operations.In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) was passed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act is a sweeping piece of legislation, and the financial services industry is still assessing the impacts. Congress detailed some significant changes, but the Dodd-Frank Act leaves many details to be determined by regulation and further study. The full impact will not be fully known for years, as regulations that are intended to implement the Dodd-Frank Act are adopted by the appropriate agencies, and the text of the Dodd-Frank Act is analyzed by impacted stakeholders and possibly the courts. The Dodd-Frank Act also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), housed in the Federal Reserve. The CFPB has been granted significant enforcement and rule-making authority in the area of consumer financial products and services. The direction that the CFPB will take, the regulations it will adopt, and its interpretation of existing laws and regulations are all elements that are not yet known. Compliance with the law may be costly and could affect operating results as the implementation of new forms, processes, procedures and controls and infrastructure may be required to comply with the regulations. Compliance may create operational constraints and place limits on pricing. Failure to comply with these regulations, changes in these or other regulations, or the imposition of additional regulations, could affect HDFS’ earnings, limit its access to capital, limit the number of loans eligible for HDFS securitization programs and have a material adverse effect on HDFS’ business and results of operations. On September 17, 2014 the CFPB proposed a rule that would expand the scope of its supervisory authority to include non-bank larger participants in the vehicle financing market. This proposed rule became effective on August 31, 2015, giving the CFPB supervisory authority over a non-bank subsidiary of HDFS, allowing the CFPB to conduct comprehensive and rigorous on-site examinations that could result in enforcement actions, fines, regulatorily mandated changes to processes and procedures, product-related changes or consumer refunds, or other actions.13U.S. Public Company - The Company is also subject to policies and actions of the SEC and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Many major competitors of the Company are not subject to the requirements of the SEC or the NYSE rules. As a result, the Company may be required to disclose certain information that may put the Company at a competitive disadvantage to its principal competitors.•The Company relies on third party suppliers to obtain raw materials and provide component parts for use in the manufacture of its motorcycles. The Company may experience supply problems relating to raw materials and components such as unfavorable pricing, poor quality, or untimely delivery. In certain circumstances, the Company relies on a single supplier to provide the entire requirement of a specific part, and a change in this established supply relationship may cause disruption in the Company’s production schedule. In addition, the price and availability of raw materials and component parts from suppliers can be adversely affected by factors outside of the Company’s control such as the supply of a necessary raw material or natural disasters. Further, Company suppliers may experience difficulty in funding their day-to-day cash flow needs because of tightening credit caused by financial market disruption. In addition, adverse economic conditions and related pressure on select suppliers due to difficulties in the global manufacturing arena could adversely affect their ability to supply the Company. These supplier risks may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations.•The Company must invest in and successfully implement new information systems and technology. The Company is continually modifying and enhancing its systems and technology to increase productivity and efficiency and to mitigate failure risks from older/aged technologies currently in its portfolio. The Company has several large, strategic information system projects in process. As new systems and technologies (and related strategies) are implemented, the Company could experience unanticipated difficulties resulting in unexpected costs and adverse impacts to its manufacturing and other business processes. When implemented, the systems and technology may not provide the benefits anticipated and could add costs and complications to ongoing operations and older technologies may fail, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations.•The Company must prevent and detect issues with its products, components purchased from suppliers, and its and its suppliers’ manufacturing processes to reduce the risk of recall campaigns, increased warranty costs or litigation, increased product liability claims or litigation, delays in new model launches, and inquiries or investigations by regulatory agencies. The Company must also complete any recall campaigns within cost expectations. The Company must continually improve and adhere to product development and manufacturing processes, and ensure that its suppliers and their sub-tier suppliers adhere to product development and manufacturing processes, to ensure high quality products are sold to retail customers. If product designs or manufacturing processes are defective, the Company could experience delays in new model launches, product recalls, inquiries or investigations from regulatory agencies, warranty claims, and product liability claims, which may involve purported class actions. While the Company uses reasonable methods to estimate the cost of warranty, recall and product liability costs and appropriately reflects those in its financial statements, there is a risk the actual costs could exceed estimates. Further, selling products with poor quality and the announcement of recalls may also adversely affect the Company’s reputation and brand strength. •The Company relies on third parties to perform certain operating and administrative functions for the Company. Similar to suppliers of raw materials and components, the Company may experience problems with outsourced services, such as unfavorable pricing, untimely delivery of services, or poor quality. Also, these suppliers may experience adverse economic conditions due to difficulties in the global economy that could lead to difficulties supporting the Company's operations. In light of the amount and types of functions that the Company has outsourced, these service provider risks may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and results of operations.•The Company manufactures products that create exposure to product liability claims and litigation. To the extent plaintiffs are successful in showing that personal injury or property damage result from defects in the design or manufacture of the Company’s products, the Company may be subject to claims for damages that are not covered by insurance. The costs associated with defending product liability claims, including frivolous lawsuits, and payment of damages could be substantial. The Company’s reputation may also be adversely affected by such claims, whether or not successful.•The Company is and may in the future become subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes. The uncertainty associated with substantial unresolved claims and lawsuits may harm the Company’s business, financial condition, reputation and brand. The defense of the lawsuits may result in the expenditures of significant financial resources and the diversion of management’s time and attention away from business operations. In addition, although the Company is unable to determine the amount, if any, that it may be required to pay in 14connection with the resolution of the lawsuits by settlement or otherwise, any such payment may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. Refer to the Company’s disclosures concerning legal proceedings in the periodic reports that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for additional detail regarding lawsuits and other claims against the Company.•The Company’s success depends upon the continued strength of the Harley-Davidson brand. The Company believes that the Harley-Davidson brand has significantly contributed to the success of its business and that maintaining and enhancing the brand is critical to expanding its customer base. Failure to protect the brand from infringers or to grow the value of the Harley-Davidson brand may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations.•The Company must maintain stakeholder confidence in its operating ethics and corporate governance practices. The Company believes it has a history of good corporate governance. Prior to the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Company had in place many of the corporate governance procedures and processes now mandated by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related rules and regulations, such as Board Committee Charters and a Corporate Governance Policy. In 1992, the Company established a Code of Business Conduct that defines how employees interact with various Company stakeholders and addresses issues such as confidentiality, conflict of interest and fair dealing. Failure to maintain its reputation for good corporate governance may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations.•The Company may not be able to successfully execute its manufacturing strategy. The Company’s manufacturing strategy is designed to continuously improve product quality and increase productivity, while reducing costs and increasing flexibility to respond to ongoing changes in the marketplace. The Company believes flexible manufacturing, including flexible supply chains and flexible labor agreements, is the key element to enable improvements in the Company’s ability to respond to customers in a cost effective manner. To execute this strategy, the Company must be successful in its continuous improvement efforts which are dependent on the involvement of management, production employees and suppliers. Any inability to achieve these objectives could adversely impact the profitability of the Company’s products and its ability to deliver the right product at the right time to the customer.•The Company, its suppliers, and its independent dealers must successfully accommodate a seasonal retail motorcycle sales pattern. The Company records the wholesale sale of a motorcycle when it is shipped to the Company’s independent dealers. The Company's flexible production capability allows it to more closely correlate motorcycle production and wholesale shipments with the retail selling season. Any difficulties in executing flexible production could result in lost production or sales. The Company, its suppliers, and its independent dealers must be able to successfully manage changes in production rates, inventory levels and other business processes associated with flexible production. Failure by the Company, its suppliers, or its independent dealers to make such adjustments may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations.•The Company incurs substantial costs with respect to employee pension and healthcare benefits. The Company’s cash funding requirements and its estimates of liabilities and expenses for pensions and healthcare benefits for both active and retired employees are based on several factors that are outside the Company’s control. These factors include funding requirements of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, the rate used to discount the future estimated liability, the rate of return on plan assets, current and projected healthcare costs, healthcare reform or legislation, retirement age and mortality. Changes in these factors can impact the expense, liabilities and cash requirements associated with these benefits which could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations, liquidity or shareholders’ equity. In addition, costs associated with these benefits put the Company under significant cost pressure as compared to its competitors that may not bear the costs of similar benefit plans. Furthermore, costs associated with complying with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act may produce additional cost pressure on the Company and its health care plans.•The ability of the Company to expand international sales may be impacted by existing or new laws and regulations that impose motorcycle licensing restrictions and limit access to roads and highways. Expanding international sales is a part of the Company’s long-term business strategy. A number of countries have tiered motorcycle licensing requirements that limit the ability of new and younger riders to obtain licenses to operate the Company’s motorcycles, and many countries are considering the implementation of such requirements. These requirements only allow new and/or younger riders to operate smaller motorcycles for certain periods of time. Riders typically are only permitted to obtain a license to ride larger motorcycles upon reaching certain ages and/or having been licensed to ride smaller motorcycles for a certain period of time, and only after passing additional tests and paying additional fees. These requirements pose obstacles to large displacement motorcycle ownership. Other 15countries have laws and regulations that prohibit motorcycles from being operated on certain roads and highways. These types of laws and regulations could adversely impact the Company’s plans to expand international sales.•The Company has a number of competitors, some of which have greater financial resources than the Company. Many of the Company’s competitors are more diversified than the Company, and they may compete in all segments of the motorcycle market, other powersports markets and/or the automotive market. Certain competitors appear to be increasing their investment in products that compete with the Company's products. Also, the Company’s manufacturer’s suggested retail price for its motorcycles is generally higher than its competitors, and if price becomes a more important competitive factor for consumers in the markets in which the Company competes, the Company may be at a competitive disadvantage. Furthermore, many competitors headquartered outside the U.S. experience a financial benefit from a strengthening in the U.S. dollar relative to their home currency that can be used to fund discounted prices to U.S. consumers. In addition, the Company’s financial services operations face competition from various banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions that may have access to additional sources of capital at more competitive rates and terms, particularly for borrowers in higher credit tiers. The Company's responses to these competitive pressures, or its failure to adequately address and respond to these competitive pressures, may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations.•The Company’s operations are dependent upon attracting and retaining skilled employees, including skilled labor, executive officers and other senior leaders. The Company’s future success depends on its continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, retain and promote skilled personnel for all areas of its organization. The Company’s current and future total compensation arrangements, which include benefits and incentive awards, may not be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating the Company’s existing employees. In addition, the Company must cultivate and sustain a work environment where employees are engaged and energized in their jobs to maximize their performance. If the Company does not succeed in attracting new personnel, retaining existing personnel, implementing effective succession plans and motivating and engaging personnel, including executive officers, the Company may be unable to develop and distribute products and services and effectively execute its plans and strategies.•The Financial Services operations rely on external sources to finance a significant portion of its operations. Liquidity is essential to the Company’s Financial Services business. Disruptions in financial markets may cause lenders and institutional investors to reduce or cease to loan money to borrowers, including financial institutions. The Company’s Financial Services operations may be negatively affected by difficulty in raising capital in the long-term and short-term capital markets. These negative consequences may in turn adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations in various ways, including through higher costs of capital, reduced funds available through its financial services operations to provide loans to independent dealers and their retail customers, and dilution to existing share value through the use of alternative sources of capital.•The Financial Services operations are highly dependent on accessing capital markets to fund their operations at competitive interest rates, the Company’s access to capital and its cost of capital are highly dependent upon its credit ratings, and any negative credit rating actions will adversely affect its earnings and results of operations. The ability of the Company and its Financial Services operations to access unsecured capital markets is influenced by their short-term and long-term credit ratings. If the Company’s credit ratings are downgraded or its ratings outlook is negatively changed, the Company’s cost of borrowing could increase, resulting in reduced earnings and interest margins, or the Company’s access to capital may be disrupted or impaired. The Company borrowed $750,000,000 in 2015 to fund the repurchase of its Common Stock, which increased the Company's leverage. Having increased leverage increases the risk of a downgrade in the Company's credit ratings.•The Financial Services operations are exposed to credit risk on its retail and wholesale receivables. Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from a failure by a customer, including the Company's independent dealers, to meet the terms of any contract with the Company’s financial services operations. Credit losses are influenced by general business and economic conditions, including unemployment rates, bankruptcy filings and other factors that negatively affect household incomes, as well as contract terms and customer credit profiles. Credit losses are also influenced by the markets for new and used motorcycles, and the Company and its independent dealers can and do take actions that impact those markets. For example, the introduction of new models by the Company that represent significant upgrades on previous models or a decrease in the inventory of used motorcycles available for sale at Harley-Davidson dealers in the U.S. may result in increased supply or decreased demand in the market for used Harley-Davidson-branded motorcycles, including motorcycles securing credit that HDFS has extended. This in turn could adversely impact the prices at which those motorcycles may be sold, which may lead to increased credit losses for HDFS. 16Negative changes in general business, economic or market factors may have an additional adverse impact on the Company’s financial services credit losses and future earnings. The Company believes HDFS' retail credit losses may continue to increase over time due to changing consumer credit behavior and HDFS' efforts to increase prudently structured loan approvals in the sub-prime lending environment. Increases in the frequency of loss and decreases in the value of repossessed Harley-Davidson branded motorcycles also adversely impact credit losses. If there are adverse circumstances that involve a material decline in values of Harley-Davidson branded motorcycles, those circumstances or any related decline in resale values for Harley-Davidson branded motorcycles could contribute to increased delinquencies and credit losses.•The Company’s Motorcycles segment is dependent upon unionized labor. Substantially all of the hourly production employees working in the Motorcycles segment are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements. Harley-Davidson Motor Company is currently a party to five collective bargaining agreements with local affiliates of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers and the United Steelworkers of America. Current collective bargaining agreements with hourly employees in Missouri, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania will expire in 2018, 2019 and 2022, respectively. Collective bargaining agreements generally cover wages, healthcare benefits and retirement plans, seniority, job classes and work rules. There is no certainty that the Company will be successful in negotiating new agreements with these unions that extend beyond the current expiration dates or that these new agreements will be on terms that will allow the Company to be competitive. Failure to renew these agreements when they expire or to establish new collective bargaining agreements on terms acceptable to the Company and the unions could result in the relocation of production facilities, work stoppages or other labor disruptions which may have a material adverse effect on customer relationships and the Company’s business and results of operations.•The Company’s operations may be affected by greenhouse emissions and climate change and related regulations. Climate change is receiving increasing attention worldwide. Many scientists, legislators and others attribute climate change to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Congress has previously considered and may in the future implement restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, several states, including states where the Company has manufacturing plants, have previously considered and may in the future implement greenhouse gas registration and reduction programs. Energy security and availability and its related costs affect all aspects of the Company’s manufacturing operations in the United States, including the Company’s supply chain. The Company’s manufacturing plants use energy, including electricity and natural gas, and certain of the Company’s plants emit amounts of greenhouse gas that may be affected by these legislative and regulatory efforts. Greenhouse gas regulation could increase the price of the electricity the Company purchases, increase costs for use of natural gas, potentially restrict access to or the use of natural gas, require the Company to purchase allowances to offset the Company’s own emissions or result in an overall increase in costs of raw materials, any one of which could increase the Company’s costs, reduce competitiveness in a global economy or otherwise negatively affect the Company’s business, operations or financial results. Many of the Company’s suppliers face similar circumstances. Physical risks to the Company’s business operations as identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and other expert bodies include scenarios such as sea level rise, extreme weather conditions and resource shortages. Extreme weather may disrupt the production and supply of component parts or other items such as natural gas, a fuel necessary for the manufacture of motorcycles and their components. Supply disruptions would raise market rates and jeopardize the continuity of motorcycle production.•Regulations related to conflict minerals and other materials that the Company purchases to use in its products will cause the Company to incur additional expenses and may have other adverse consequences. The SEC adopted inquiry, diligence and disclosure requirements related to certain minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo and surrounding countries, or "conflict minerals", that are necessary to the functionality of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by an SEC reporting company. Compliance with the disclosure requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of some of the minerals that the Company uses in the manufacturing of its products. The Company's supply chain is complex, and if it is not able to determine the source and chain of custody for all conflict minerals used in its products that are sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo and surrounding countries or determine that its products are "conflict free", then the Company may face reputational challenges with customers, investors or others. Additionally, as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering "conflict free" minerals, if the Company chooses to use only conflict minerals that are "conflict free", the Company cannot be sure that it will be able to obtain necessary materials from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Accordingly, the Company could incur significant costs related to the compliance process, including potential difficulty or added costs in satisfying the disclosure requirements. Other laws or regulations impacting our supply chain, such as the UK Modern Slavery Act, may have similar consequences.17The Company disclaims any obligation to update these Risk Factors or any other forward-looking statements. The Company assumes no obligation (and specifically disclaims any such obligation) to update these Risk Factors or any other forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or other factors affecting such forward-looking statements.
