Item 1A. Risk Factors” and the section entitled “Cautionary Language Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Item 7. MD&A.  In particular, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results are expected to be materially affected by the final outcome of the CPUC’s pending investigative enforcement proceedings against the Utility.  These investigations relate to (1) the Utility’s safety recordkeeping for its natural gas transmission system, (2) the Utility’s operation of its natural gas transmission pipeline system in or near locations of higher population density, and (3) the Utility’s pipeline installation, integrity management, recordkeeping and other operational practices, and other events or courses of conduct, that could have led to or contributed to the pipeline accident that occurred in San Bruno, California on September 9, 2010.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows have been materially affected by the costs the Utility has incurred related to shareholder funded safety work, the ongoing regulatory investigations, and civil lawsuits that commenced following the San Bruno accident.  In addition, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could be materially affected by the outcome of the federal criminal prosecution of the Utility and the other enforcement matters discussed in “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Item 7. MD&A.

Regulatory Environment 




The Utility's business is subject to a complex set of energy, environmental and other laws, regulations, and regulatory proceedings at the federal, state, and local levels.  This section and the “Ratemaking Mechanisms” section below summarize some of the more significant laws, regulations, and regulatory proceedings affecting the Utility.  See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” and “Ratemaking and Other Regulatory Proceedings” in Item 7. MD&A for discussion of specific pending regulatory matters that are expected to materially affect PG&E Corporation and the Utility.




PG&E Corporation is a “public utility holding company” as defined under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 and is subject to regulatory oversight by the FERC.  PG&E Corporation and its subsidiaries are exempt from all requirements of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 other than the obligation to provide access to their books and records to the FERC and the CPUC for ratemaking purposes.

 


The California Public Utilities Commission  

 



The CPUC consists of five members appointed by the Governor of California and confirmed by the California State Senate for staggered six-year terms.  The CPUC has jurisdiction over the rates and terms and conditions of service for the Utility's electricity and natural gas distribution operations, electricity generation, and natural gas transmission and storage services.  The CPUC also has jurisdiction over the Utility's issuances of securities, dispositions of utility assets and facilities, energy purchases on behalf of the Utility's electricity and natural gas retail customers, rates of return, rates of depreciation, oversight of nuclear decommissioning, and aspects of the siting of facilities used in providing electric and natural gas utility service.





The California Legislature also directs the CPUC to implement state laws and policies, such as the laws relating to increasing renewable energy resources, the development and widespread deployment of distributed generation and self-generation resources, the reduction of GHG emissions, and the development of energy storage technologies and facilities.  In addition, the CPUC is responsible for approving funding and administration of state-mandated public purpose programs such as energy efficiency and other customer programs. 




The CPUC enforces state laws that set forth safety requirements pertaining to the design, construction, testing, operation, and maintenance of utility electric and gas facilities.  The CPUC also has authority to enforce compliance with certain federal regulations related to the safety of natural gas facilities.  The CPUC has adopted a gas safety enforcement program and authorized the SED to issue citations and impose fines for violations of certain state and federal regulations that relate to the safety of natural gas facilities and operating practices.  (See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Item 7. MD&A for information about the presiding officer decisions issued in the three CPUC investigative enforcement proceedings pending against the Utility and SED’s enforcement actions taken against the Utility.)  In December 2014, the CPUC also adopted an interim electric safety enforcement program that became effective January 1, 2015.  (On January 7, 2015, the Utility requested that the CPUC reconsider this decision.)  Under both the gas and electric programs, the SED can impose fines up to $50,000 per violation, per day.  The CPUC is expected to review both safety programs during 2015 to determine whether any further changes are needed.

 

In addition, the CPUC conducts audits and reviews of the Utility’s accounting, performance and compliance with regulatory guidelines, as well as investigations into various matters, such as deregulation, competition, and the environment, in order to determine its future policies.  The CPUC has imposed various conditions that govern the relationship between the Utility and PG&E Corporation and other affiliates, including financial conditions that require PG&E Corporation’s Board of Directors to give first priority to the capital requirements of the Utility, as determined to be necessary and prudent to meet the Utility's obligation to serve or to operate the Utility in a prudent and efficient manner. (For more information, see “Liquidity and Financial Resources” in Item 7. MD&A and Item 1A. Risk Factors.)

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the California Independent System Operator




The FERC has jurisdiction over the Utility's electricity transmission revenue requirements and rates, the licensing of substantially all of the Utility's hydroelectric generation facilities, and the interstate sale and transportation of natural gas. The FERC regulates interconnections of transmission systems with other electric systems and generation facilities, tariffs and conditions of service of regional transmission organizations and the terms and rates of wholesale electricity sales.  The FERC also is charged with adopting and enforcing mandatory standards governing the reliability of the nation’s electricity transmission grid, including standards to protect the nation’s bulk power system against potential disruptions from cyber and physical security breaches. The FERC has authority to impose fines of up to $1 million per day for violation of certain federal statutes and regulations.




The CAISO is the FERC-approved regional transmission organization for the Utility’s service territory.  The CAISO controls the operation of the transmission system in California and provides open access transmission service on a nondiscriminatory basis.  The CAISO also is responsible for planning transmission system additions, ensuring the maintenance of adequate reserves of generation capacity, and ensuring that the reliability of the transmission system is maintained.

 

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission




The NRC oversees the licensing, construction, operation and decommissioning of nuclear facilities, including the Utility’s two nuclear generating units at Diablo Canyon and the Utility’s retired nuclear generating unit at Humboldt Bay.  (See “Electric Generation Resources” below.)  NRC regulations require extensive monitoring and review of the safety, radiological, seismic, environmental, and security aspects of these facilities.  In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines or to force a shutdown of a nuclear plant, or both.  NRC safety and security requirements have, in the past, necessitated substantial capital expenditures at Diablo Canyon, and substantial capital expenditures could be required in the future.

 

Other Regulation




The California Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission, commonly called the CEC, is the state's primary energy policy and planning agency.  The CEC is responsible for licensing all thermal power plants over 50 MW within California.  The CEC also is responsible for forecasts of future energy needs used by the CPUC in determining the adequacy of the utilities' electricity procurement plans.




The CARB is the state agency charged with setting and monitoring GHG and other emission limits.  The CARB also is responsible for adopting and enforcing regulations to implement state law requirements to gradually reduce GHG emissions in California to 1990 levels by 2020.  (See “Environmental Regulation — Air Quality and Climate Change” below.)




In addition, the Utility obtains permits, authorizations, and licenses in connection with the construction and operation of the Utility's generation facilities, electricity transmission lines, natural gas transportation pipelines, and gas compressor station facilities.  The Utility also periodically obtains permits, authorizations, and licenses in connection with distribution of electricity and natural gas that grant the Utility rights to occupy and/or use public property for the operation of the Utility's business and to conduct certain related operations.  The Utility has franchise agreements with approximately 300 cities and counties that permit the Utility to install, operate, and maintain the Utility's electric and natural gas facilities in the public streets and roads.  In exchange for the right to use public streets and roads, the Utility pays annual fees to the cities and counties.  In most cases, the Utility’s franchise agreements are for an indeterminate term, with no expiration date.

Ratemaking Mechanisms




The Utility’s rates for electricity and natural gas utility services are set at levels that are intended to allow the Utility to recover its costs of providing service including a return on invested capital (“cost-of-service ratemaking”).  Before setting rates, the CPUC and the FERC conduct various proceedings to determine the annual amount that the Utility will be authorized to collect from its customers (“revenue requirements”).  The Utility’s revenue requirements consist primarily of a base amount set to enable the Utility to recover its reasonable operating expenses (maintenance, administration and general expenses) and capital costs (depreciation, tax, and financing expenses).  In addition, the CPUC authorizes the Utility to collect revenues to recover costs that it is allowed to “pass-through” to customers, including its costs to procure electricity, natural gas and nuclear fuel, to administer public purpose and customer programs, and to decommission its nuclear facilities.

 

The Utility’s rate of return on electric transmission assets is determined in the FERC TO proceedings.  The authorized rate of return on all other assets is set in the CPUC’s cost of capital proceeding.  Other than its electric transmission and certain gas transmission and storage revenues, the Utility’s base revenues are “decoupled” from its sales volume.  Regulatory balancing accounts, or revenue adjustment mechanisms, ensure that the Utility will fully collect its authorized base revenue requirements.  The Utility’s earnings primarily depend on its ability to manage its base operating and capital costs (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs that Impact Earnings” in Item 7. MD&A) within its authorized base revenue requirements.




To develop retail rates, authorized revenue requirements are allocated among customer classes which are mainly residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural.  Rate changes become effective prospectively on or after the date of CPUC or FERC decisions.




California AB 327, which became effective on January 1, 2014, repealed prior law that restricted the CPUC’s ability to change residential electric rates and to reduce the level of rate assistance for certain low-income customers.  AB 327 also authorized the CPUC to approve fixed charges to be collected from residential customers.  In 2012, the CPUC opened a rulemaking proceeding to examine residential rate design in California that, consistent with AB 327, allows the CPUC to simplify the rate structure to bring marginal rates closer to reflecting the Utility’s actual costs.  In February 2014, as ordered by the CPUC, the Utility submitted a long-term residential rate reform plan that proposes a fixed customer charge, gradual flattening of the tiered rate structure, and an optional time-of-use rate.  The CPUC is expected to issue a final decision by the summer of 2015.




AB 327 also requires the CPUC to develop a new structure for net energy metering by December 31, 2015, that must be implemented no later than July 1, 2017.  California’s net energy metering program currently allows customers installing renewable distributed generation to receive bill credits for power delivered to the grid at their full retail rate.  Increasing levels of self-generation of electricity by customers, coupled with net metering and retail rates that do not reflect the Utility’s cost structure, has shifted costs to the remaining customers.  AB 327 gives the CPUC new authority to reduce the cost shift associated with renewable distributed generation through residential rate and net energy metering reform.  In July 2014, the CPUC began a rulemaking proceeding to develop a successor to the existing net energy metering program to comply with the requirements of AB 327.  The CPUC is expected to issue a proposed decision in the fall of 2015.




From time to time, the CPUC may use incentive ratemaking mechanisms that provide the Utility an opportunity to earn additional revenues.  For example, the Utility has earned incentives for the successful implementation of energy efficiency programs.  (See “Results of Operations” in Item 7. MD&A.)

Base Revenues

 

General Rate Cases




The GRC is the primary proceeding in which the CPUC determines the amount of base revenue requirements that the Utility is authorized to collect from customers to recover the Utility’s anticipated costs, including return on rate base, related to its electricity and natural gas distribution and Utility owned electricity generation operations.  The CPUC generally conducts a GRC every three years.  The CPUC approves the annual revenue requirements for the first year (or “test year”) of the GRC period and typically authorizes the Utility to receive annual increases (known as “attrition adjustments”) in revenue requirements for the subsequent years of the GRC period.  Attrition rate adjustments are generally provided for cost increases related to inflation and increases in invested capital.  Parties in the Utility's GRC include the ORA and TURN, who generally represent the overall interests of residential customers, as well as a myriad of other intervenors who represent residential and other customer interests.




On August 14, 2014, the CPUC issued a decision in the Utility’s 2014 GRC, authorizing the Utility to collect a total 2014 revenue requirement of approximately $7.1 billion to recover anticipated costs associated with electric generation, as well as electric and natural gas distribution (See “Results of Operations” in Item 7. MD&A.) The CPUC also authorized attrition increases of $324 million for 2015 and $371 million for 2016.  




On December 9, 2014, the CPUC issued a decision adopting a risk-based decision-making framework for the CPUC to use in evaluating future major rate cases.  The CPUC ordered the utilities to file an application on May 1, 2015, to initiate a new proceeding called the Safety Model Assessment Proceeding in which the CPUC will review the models the utilities use to assess and prioritize risks.  After this proceeding concludes, each utility would file an application to initiate the first phase of their next GRC.  In this phase, known as the Risk Assessment Mitigation Phase, the CPUC will examine the utility’s assessment of its key risks and its proposed programs for mitigating those risks.   




Natural Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Cases




The CPUC determines the Utility’s authorized revenue requirements and rates for its natural gas transmission and storage services in the GT&S rate case.  In December 2013, the Utility filed its 2015 GT&S rate case application (covering 2015 through 2017) requesting the CPUC approve a total annual revenue requirement of $1.29 billion for anticipated costs of providing natural gas transmission and storage services beginning on January 1, 2015.  See “Ratemaking and Other Regulatory Proceedings – 2015 GT&S Rate Case” in Item 7. MD&A for additional information.  




Cost of Capital Proceedings




The CPUC periodically conducts a cost of capital proceeding to authorize the Utility's capital structure and rates of return for its electric generation, electric and natural gas distribution, and natural gas transmission and storage rate base.  The CPUC has authorized the Utility’s capital structure through 2016, consisting of 52% common equity, 47% long-term debt, and 1% preferred stock.  The CPUC also authorized the Utility to earn a 10.40% ROE effective January 1, 2013, compared to the 11.35% previously authorized.  The Utility’s ROE can be automatically adjusted if the utility bond index changes by certain thresholds on an annual basis.  The index changes to date have not exceeded the threshold so the 2015 ROE has remained at 10.40%.  The Utility’s next cost of capital application is due in April 2016.




Electricity Transmission Owner Rate Cases




The FERC determines the amount of authorized revenue requirement, including rate of return on electric transmission assets, that the Utility may collect in rates in the TO tariff rate case.  The Utility generally files a TO tariff rate case every year.  The FERC typically authorizes the Utility to charge new rates based on the requested revenue requirement, subject to refund, before the FERC has issued a final decision.  These FERC-approved rates are included by the CPUC in the Utility's retail electric rates and are collected from retail electric customers.  (See “Ratemaking and Other Regulatory Proceedings – FERC Transmission Owner Rate Cases” in Item 7. MD&A.)  The Utility also recovers revenue requirements for its wholesale electric transmission costs through charges collected under specific contracts with wholesale transmission customers that the Utility entered into before the CAISO began its operations in 1998.  These wholesale customers are charged individualized rates based on the terms of their contracts.

Revenues to Recover Energy Procurement and Other Pass-Through Costs




Electricity Procurement Costs




California investor-owned electric utilities are responsible for procuring electricity required to meet customer demand, plus applicable reserve margins, that are not satisfied from their own generation facilities and existing electricity contracts.  The utilities are responsible for scheduling and bidding electric generation resources, including electricity procured from third parties or the wholesale market, to meet customer demand according to which resources are the least expensive (i.e., using the principles of “least-cost dispatch”).  In addition, the utilities are required to obtain CPUC approval of their procurement plans based on long-term demand forecasts.  In January 2012, the CPUC approved the Utility’s procurement plan (covering 2012 through 2020).




California law allows electric utilities to recover the costs incurred in compliance with their CPUC-approved electricity procurement plans without further after-the-fact reasonableness review.  Costs associated with electricity purchases may be disallowed if they are not in compliance with the CPUC-approved plan or if the utility failed to follow the principles of least-cost dispatch.  The Utility recovers its electricity procurement costs annually through the energy resource recovery account (“ERRA”).  (See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)  Each year, the CPUC reviews the Utility’s forecasted procurement costs related to power purchase agreements, derivative instruments, GHG costs, and generation fuel expense and approves a forecasted revenue requirement.  The CPUC may adjust a utility’s retail electricity rates more frequently if the forecasted aggregate over-collections or under-collections in the ERRA exceed five percent of its prior year electricity procurement revenues.  The CPUC performs an annual compliance review of the transactions recorded in the ERRA.




The CPUC has approved various power purchase agreements that the Utility has entered into with third parties in accordance with the Utility’s CPUC-approved procurement plan, the renewable energy mandate, and resource adequacy requirements.  See “Electric Utility Operations – Electricity Resources” below as well as Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information.




Natural Gas Procurement and Transportation Costs




The Utility sets the natural gas procurement rate for small commercial and residential customers (referred to as “core” customers) monthly, based on the forecasted costs of natural gas, core pipeline capacity and storage costs.  The Utility recovers the cost of gas purchased on behalf of core customers as well as the cost of derivative instruments through its retail gas rates subject to limits as set forth in its Core Procurement Incentive Mechanism (“CPIM”).  The Utility reflects the difference between actual natural gas purchase costs and forecasted natural gas purchase costs in several natural gas balancing accounts, with under-collections and over-collections taken into account in subsequent monthly rates.  This is accomplished through monthly advice letters that are effective upon filing.  The Utility recovers the cost of gas used in generation facilities as a cost of electricity that is recovered annually through retail electricity rates.




The CPIM protects the Utility against after-the-fact reasonableness reviews of these gas procurement costs.  Under the CPIM, the Utility’s natural gas purchase costs for a fixed 12-month period are compared to an aggregate market-based benchmark based on a weighted average of published monthly and daily natural gas price indices at the points where the Utility typically purchases natural gas.  Costs that fall within a tolerance band, which is 99% to 102% of the commodity benchmark, are considered reasonable and are fully recovered in customers’ rates.  One-half of the costs above 102% of the benchmark are recoverable in customers’ rates, and the Utility's customers receive in their rates 80% of any savings resulting from the Utility’s cost of natural gas that is less than 99% of the benchmark.  The Utility retains the remaining amount of savings as incentive revenues, subject to a cap equal to 1.5% of total natural gas commodity costs.  While this incentive mechanism remains in place, changes in the price of natural gas, consistent with the market-based benchmark, are not expected to materially impact net income.

The Utility incurs transportation costs under various agreements with interstate and Canadian third-party transportation service providers.  These providers transport natural gas from the points at which the Utility takes delivery of natural gas (typically in Canada, the U.S. Rocky Mountains, and the southwestern United States) to the points at which the Utility's natural gas transportation system begins.  These agreements are governed by FERC-approved tariffs that detail rates, rules, and terms of service for the provision of natural gas transportation services to the Utility on interstate and Canadian pipelines.  United States tariffs are approved for each pipeline for service to all of its shippers, including the Utility, by the FERC in a FERC ratemaking review process, and the applicable Canadian tariffs are approved by the Alberta Utilities Commission and the National Energy Board.  The transportation costs the Utility incurs under these agreements are recovered through CPUC-approved rates as core natural gas procurement costs or as a cost of electricity.




Costs Associated with Public Purpose and Customer Programs




The CPUC authorizes the Utility to recover the costs of various public purpose and other customer programs through the collection of rates from most Utility customers.  These programs relate to energy efficiency, demand response, distributed generation, energy research and development, and other matters.  Additionally, the CPUC has authorized the Utility to provide a discount rate for low-income customers, known as California Alternate Rates for Energy (“CARE”), which is subsidized by the Utility’s other customers.




Nuclear Decommissioning Costs




The Utility's nuclear power facilities consist of two units at Diablo Canyon and the retired facility at Humboldt Bay.  Nuclear decommissioning requires the safe removal of nuclear facilities from service and the reduction of residual radioactivity to a level that permits termination of the NRC license and release of the property for unrestricted use.  The Utility files an application with the CPUC every three years requesting approval of the Utility’s estimated decommissioning costs and authorization to recover the estimated costs through rates.  Nuclear decommissioning charges collected through rates are held in nuclear decommissioning trusts to be used for the eventual decommissioning of each nuclear unit.




Electric Utility Operations




The Utility generates electricity and provides electricity transmission and distribution services throughout its service territory in northern and central California to residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural customers.  The Utility provides “bundled” services (i.e., electricity, transmission and distribution services) to most customers in its service territory.  Customers also can obtain electricity from alternative providers such as municipalities or CCAs, as well as from self-generation resources, such as rooftop solar installations.




During 2014, the Utility continued to make improvements to its electric transmission and distribution systems to accommodate the integration of new renewable energy resources, distributed generation resources, and energy storage facilities, and to help create a platform for the development of new Smart Grid technologies.  The Utility plans to continue making similar improvements in 2015.  In December 2014, the CPUC issued a decision that permits the California investor-owned electric utilities to own EV retail charging equipment in their respective service territories to help meet the state’s goal of reducing GHG emissions by promoting cleaner transportation.  On February 9, 2015, the Utility filed an application to request that the CPUC approve the Utility’s proposal to develop, maintain, and operate an EV-charging infrastructure in its service territory.  (For more information about the Utility’s application, see “Ratemaking And Other Regulatory Proceedings” in Item 7. MD&A.)

Electricity Resources




The Utility is required to maintain physical generating capacity adequate to meet its customers’ demand for electricity (“load”), including peak demand and planning and operating reserves, deliverable to the locations and at times as may be necessary to provide reliable electric service.  The Utility is required to dispatch, or schedule all of the electricity resources within its portfolio in the most cost-effective way.




The following table shows the percentage of the Utility’s total deliveries of electricity to customers in 2014 represented by each major electricity resource, and further discussed below.

Renewable Energy Resources.  California law requires load-serving entities, such as the Utility, to gradually increase the amount of renewable energy they deliver to their customers to at least 33% of their total annual retail sales.  This program, known as the RPS program, became effective in December 2011, established three multi-year compliance periods that have gradually increasing RPS targets:  2011 through 2013, 2014 through 2016, and 2017 through 2020.  After 2020, the RPS compliance periods will be annual.




Renewable generation resources, for purposes of the RPS program, include bioenergy such as biogas and biomass, certain hydroelectric facilities (30 MW or less), wind, solar, and geothermal energy.  During 2014, 27% of the Utility’s energy deliveries were from renewable energy sources, exceeding the annual RPS target of 23.3%.  Approximately 22% of the renewable energy delivered to the Utility’s customers was purchased from non-QF third parties.  Additional renewable resources were provided by QFs (3.8%), the Utility’s small hydroelectric facilities (0.8%), and the Utility’s solar facilities (0.5%).

Energy Storage.  As required by California law, the CPUC has established initial energy storage procurement targets to be achieved by each load-serving entity, such as the Utility.  The Utility has an 80.5 MW of energy storage target to meet its 2014 energy storage plan.  In December 2014, the Utility held its first competitive request for two types of proposals:  (1) an energy storage agreement with the owner of an energy storage facility that would enable the Utility to offer stored energy into the CAISO market and (2) a purchase and sale agreement under which the counterparty would build a storage facility and transfer the facility to the Utility provided the facility meets certain operational conditions.  Offers are due by February 17, 2015.  The Utility intends to complete negotiations and execute contracts by October 1, 2015 and to submit the executed contracts for CPUC approval by December 1, 2015.




Owned Generation Facilities.  At December 31, 2014, the Utility owned the following generation facilities, all located in California, listed by energy source and further described below:

(1) The Utility's Diablo Canyon power plant consists of two nuclear power reactor units, Units 1 and 2.  For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Utility’s Diablo Canyon power plant achieved an average overall capacity factor of approximately 87%.  The ability of the Utility to produce nuclear generation depends on the availability of nuclear fuel.  The Utility has entered into various purchase agreements for nuclear fuel that are intended to ensure long-term fuel supply.  (See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)  The Diablo Canyon power plant refueling outages are typically scheduled every 20 months.  The average length of a refueling outage over the last five years has been approximately 49.5 days.  The actual refueling schedule and outage duration will depend on the scope of the work required for a particular outage and other factors.  The NRC operating licenses for the two operating units at Diablo Canyon include various license conditions related to seismic design and safety.  The current licenses expire in 2024 and 2025.  In November 2009, the Utility filed an application with the NRC to seek the renewal of the licenses, a process which can take several years.  After the March 2011 earthquake in Japan that damaged nuclear facilities, the NRC granted the Utility’s request to delay processing its renewal application until certain advanced seismic studies of the fault zones in the region surrounding Diablo Canyon were completed.  The seismic studies have been completed and in September 2014, the Utility submitted a report to the NRC and the CPUC’s Independent Peer Review Panel that confirmed the seismic safety of the plant.  The Independent Review Panel is providing comments on the report and the Utility expects its review to be completed within the next six to eight months.  (See also “Environmental Matters” and Item 1A. Risk Factors.)

(2) The Utility’s hydroelectric system consists of 107 generating units at 67 powerhouses.  All of the Utility’s powerhouses are licensed by the FERC (except for three small powerhouses not subject to FERC licensing requirements), with license terms between 30 and 50 years.

(3) The Utility’s larger operational photovoltaic facilities include the Five Points solar station (15 MW), the Westside solar station (15 MW), the Stroud solar station (20 MW), the Huron solar station (20 MW), the Cantua solar station (20 MW), the Giffen solar station (10 MW), the Gates solar station (20 MW), the West Gates solar station (10 MW) and the Guernsey solar station (20 MW).  All of these facilities are located in Fresno County, except for the Guernsey solar station, which is located in Kings County.

 

Generation Resources from Third Parties.  The Utility has entered into various agreements to purchase power and electric capacity, including agreements for renewable energy resources, in accordance with its CPUC-approved procurement plan.  (See “Ratemaking Mechanisms” above.)  For more information regarding the Utility’s power purchase agreements, see Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Electricity Transmission 




At December 31, 2014, the Utility owned approximately 18,100 circuit miles of interconnected transmission lines operating at voltages ranging from 60 kV to 500 kV.  The Utility also operated 91 electric transmission substations with a capacity of approximately 63,400 MVA.  The Utility’s electric transmission system is interconnected with electric power systems in the Western Electricity Coordinating Council, which includes many western states, Alberta and British Columbia, and parts of Mexico.




In November 2013, the Utility, MidAmerican Transmission, LLC, and Citizens Energy Corporation were selected by the CAISO to jointly develop a new 230-kV transmission line to address the growing power demand in Fresno, Madera and Kings counties area.  The 70-mile line will connect the Utility-owned and -operated Gates and Gregg substations.  The new line will help reduce the number and duration of power outages, improve voltage in the area, support economic development, and bolster efforts to integrate clean, renewable energy onto the grid.  The transmission line is expected to commence operations by 2022, and could come online earlier.




Throughout 2014, the Utility upgraded several critical substations and re-conductored a number of transmission lines to improve maintenance and system flexibility, reliability and safety.  The Utility expects to undertake various additional transmission projects over the next several years to upgrade and expand the capacity of its transmission system to accommodate system load growth, secure access to renewable generation resources, replace aging or obsolete equipment and improve system reliability.  The Utility also has taken steps to improve the physical security of its transmission substations and equipment.




Electricity Distribution




The Utility's electricity distribution network consists of approximately 141,700 circuit miles of distribution lines (of which approximately 20% are underground and approximately 80% are overhead), 55 transmission switching substations, and 603 distribution substations, with a capacity of approximately 30,200 MVA.  The Utility’s distribution network interconnects with its transmission system, primarily at switching and distribution substations, where equipment reduces the high-voltage transmission voltages to lower voltages, ranging from 44 kV to 2.4 kV, suitable for distribution to the Utility’s customers.




These distribution substations serve as the central hubs for the Utility’s electric distribution network.  Emanating from each substation are primary and secondary distribution lines connected to local transformers and switching equipment that link distribution lines and provide delivery to end-users.  In some cases, the Utility sells electricity from its distribution facilities to entities, such as municipal and other utilities, that resell the electricity.  In October 2014, the Utility commenced operations at the first of three new electric distribution control centers.  This 24,000-square foot, state-of-the-art facility, located in Fresno, California, will enhance electric reliability and resiliency for the Utility’s customers throughout the Central Valley and will utilize current and future Smart Grid technologies.  Additional facilities in Rocklin and Concord, California, are expected to be completed in 2015 and 2016, respectively.  These control centers form a key part of the Utility’s efforts to create a smarter, more resilient grid.




In 2014, the Utility replaced approximately 295,000 feet of underground cable, replaced approximately 975,000 feet of overhead wire, and installed or replaced 20 distribution substation transformer banks to improve reliability and provide capacity to accommodate growing demand.  The Utility plans to continue performing work to improve the reliability and safety of its electricity distribution operations in 2015.

Natural Gas Utility Operations 




The Utility provides natural gas transportation services to “core” customers (i.e., small commercial and residential customers) and to “non-core” customers (i.e., industrial, large commercial, and natural gas-fired electric generation facilities) that are connected to the Utility’s gas system in its service territory.  Core customers can purchase natural gas procurement service (i.e., natural gas supply) from either the Utility or non-utility third-party gas procurement service providers (referred to as core transport agents).  When core customers purchase gas supply from a core transport agent, the Utility continues to provide gas delivery, metering and billing services to customers.  When the Utility provides both transportation and procurement services, the Utility refers to the combined service as “bundled” natural gas service.  Currently, more than 91% of core customers, representing nearly 80% of the annual core market demand, receive bundled natural gas service from the Utility. 




The Utility does not provide procurement service to non-core customers, who must purchase their gas supplies from third-party suppliers.  The Utility offers backbone gas transmission, gas delivery (local transmission and distribution), and gas storage services as separate and distinct services to its non-core customers.  Access to the Utility's backbone gas transmission system is available for all natural gas marketers and shippers, as well as non-core customers.  The Utility also delivers gas to off-system customers (i.e., outside of the Utility’s service territory) and to third-party natural gas storage customers.

 

Natural Gas Supplies




The Utility can receive natural gas from all the major natural gas basins in western North America, including basins in western Canada, the Rocky Mountains, and the southwestern United States.  The Utility also is supplied by natural gas fields in California.  The Utility purchases natural gas to serve its core customers directly from producers and marketers in both Canada and the United States.  The contract lengths and natural gas sources of the Utility’s portfolio of natural gas purchase contracts have fluctuated generally based on market conditions.  During 2014, the Utility purchased approximately 269,590 MMcf of natural gas (net of the sale of excess supply of gas).  Substantially all this natural gas was purchased under contracts with a term of one year or less.  The Utility’s largest individual supplier represented approximately 17% of the total natural gas volume the Utility purchased during 2014.




Natural Gas System Assets




The Utility owns and operates an integrated natural gas transmission, storage, and distribution system that includes most of northern and central California.  At December 31, 2014, the Utility’s natural gas system consisted of approximately 42,700 miles of distribution pipelines, over 6,400 miles of backbone and local transmission pipelines, and various storage facilities.  The Utility owns and operates eight natural gas compressor stations on its backbone transmission system and one small station on its local transmission system that are used to move gas through the Utility’s pipelines.  The Utility’s backbone transmission system, composed primarily of Lines 300, 400, and 401, is used to transport gas from the Utility’s interconnection with interstate pipelines, other local distribution companies, and California gas fields to the Utility’s local transmission and distribution systems.




 The Utility has firm transportation agreements for delivery of natural gas from western Canada to the United States-Canada border with TransCanada NOVA Gas Transmission, Ltd. and TransCanada Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd., B.C. System.  These companies’ pipeline systems connect at the border to the pipeline system owned by Gas Transmission Northwest, LLC, which provides natural gas transportation services to a point of interconnection with the Utility’s natural gas transportation system on the Oregon-California border near Malin, Oregon.  The Utility also has firm transportation agreements with Ruby Pipeline, LLC to transport this gas from the U.S Rocky Mountains to the interconnection point with the Utility’s natural gas transportation system in the area of Malin, Oregon, at the California border, and firm transportation agreements with Transwestern Pipeline Company, LLC and El Paso Natural Gas Company to transport this natural gas from supply points in the U.S. Southwest to interconnection points with the Utility's natural gas transportation system in the area of California near Topock, Arizona.  The Utility also has a transportation agreement with Kern River Gas Transmission Company to transport gas from the U.S. Rocky Mountains to the interconnection point with the Utility’s natural gas system in the area of Daggett, California.  For more information regarding the Utility’s natural gas transportation agreements, see Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.






  



12







  



The Utility owns and operates three underground natural gas storage fields and has a 25% interest in a fourth storage field, all of which are connected to the Utility’s transmission system.  The Utility owns and operates compressors and other facilities at these storage fields that are used to inject gas into the fields for storage and later withdrawal.  In addition, four independent storage operators are interconnected to the Utility's northern California transmission system.




The Utility also owns and operates a 42,000-square-foot control center in San Ramon, California to monitor and control all aspects of its natural gas system across its service area. 




During 2014, the Utility completed its system-wide replacement of 847 miles of cast iron natural gas distribution pipeline with plastic pipe.  Additionally, the Utility conducted an annual system-wide review of its transmission pipeline class location designations.  As part of its distribution integrity management program, during 2014 the Utility completed inspections of approximately 35,000 sewer laterals.




Since work began on the PSEP and other gas transmission work in 2011, the Utility has validated the maximum allowable operating pressure for all of its transmission pipelines through records verification; accomplished four-year goal of strength testing or records validation of 783 miles of transmission pipeline; replaced 127 miles of transmission pipeline; automated 208 valves; and collected and digitized more than 3.8 million pipeline records.

Competition




Competition in the Electricity Industry




California law allows qualifying non-residential customers of investor-owned electric utilities to purchase electricity from energy service providers other than the regulated utilities, (referred to as “direct access”) up to certain annual and overall GWh limits that have been specified for each utility.  

 

The Utility’s customers may, under certain circumstances, obtain power from a CCA instead of from the Utility.  California law permits cities and counties and certain other public agencies to generate and/or purchase electricity for their local residents and businesses after they have registered as CCAs and submitted an Implementation Plan to the CPUC.  Under these arrangements, the Utility continues to provide transmission, distribution, metering, and billing services to the customers of the CCAs and remains the electricity provider of last resort for those customers.  The law provides that a CCA can procure electricity for all of its residents who do not affirmatively elect to continue to receive electricity from the Utility.  The Utility is able to recover from each CCA any costs of implementing the program that are reasonably attributable to the CCA, and to recover from all customers any costs of implementing the program not reasonably attributable to a CCA.




In some circumstances, governmental entities such as cities and irrigation districts, which have authority under the state constitution or state statute to provide retail electric service, seek to acquire the Utility’s distribution facilities, either under a consensual transaction, or via eminent domain.

 

The Utility is also subject to increased competition due to the increasing viability of distributed generation and energy storage.  The levels of self-generation of electricity by customers (primarily solar installations) and the use of customer net energy metering, which allows self-generating customers to receive bill credits at the full retail rate, are increasing.

 

Competition in the Natural Gas Industry

 

The Utility primarily competes with other natural gas pipeline companies for customers transporting natural gas into the southern California market on the basis of transportation rates, access to competitively priced supplies of natural gas, and the quality and reliability of transportation services.  The Utility also competes for storage services with other third-party storage providers, primarily in northern California.




Environmental Regulation




The Utility’s operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and requirements relating to the protection of the environment and the safety and health of the Utility's personnel and the public.  These laws and requirements relate to a broad range of activities, including the remediation of hazardous and radioactive substances; the discharge of pollutants into the air, water, and soil; the reporting and reduction of carbon monoxide (CO­2 ) and other GHG emissions; the transportation, handling, storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel; and the environmental impacts of land use, including endangered species and habitat protection. The penalties for violation of these laws and requirements can be severe and may include significant fines, damages, and criminal or civil sanctions.  These laws and requirements also may require the Utility, under certain circumstances, to interrupt or curtail operations.  (See Item 1A. Risk Factors.)  Generally, the Utility has recovered most of the costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations in the Utility's rates, subject to reasonableness review.  Environmental costs associated with the clean-up of most sites that contain hazardous substances are subject to a special ratemaking mechanism described in Note 14: Contingencies—Environmental Remediation Contingencies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.






  



14







  



Hazardous Waste Compliance and Remediation




The Utility's facilities are subject to the requirements of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 as amended (CERCLA).  The Utility is also subject to the regulations adopted by the EPA, the federal agency responsible for implementing the federal environmental laws.  The Utility also must comply with environmental laws and regulations adopted by the State of California and various state and local agencies.  These federal and state laws impose strict liability for the release of a hazardous substance on the (1) owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, (2) on companies that disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of, the hazardous substances, and (3) in some cases, their corporate successors.  Under CERCLA these persons (known as “potentially responsible parties”) may be jointly and severally liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances, paying for the harm caused to natural resources, and paying for the costs of required health studies.




The Utility has a comprehensive program in place to comply with these federal, state, and local laws and regulations.  Under federal and California laws, the Utility may be responsible for remediation of hazardous substances even if it did not deposit those substances on the site.  The Utility’s remediation activities are overseen by the California Department of Toxic Substances Control, several California regional water quality control boards, and various other federal, state, and local agencies.  The Utility has incurred significant environmental remediation liabilities associated with former manufactured gas plant sites, power plant sites, gas gathering sites, sites where natural gas compressor stations are located, and sites used by the Utility for the storage, recycling, or disposal of potentially hazardous substances.  Groundwater at the Utility’s Hinkley and Topock natural gas compressor stations contains hexavalent chromium as a result of the Utility’s past operating practices.  The Utility is responsible for remediating this groundwater contamination and for abating the effects of the contamination on the environment.




For more information about environmental remediation liabilities, see Note 14:  Commitments and Contingencies−Environmental Remediation Contingencies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.




Air Quality and Climate Change




The Utility's electricity generation plants, natural gas pipeline operations, fleet, and fuel storage tanks are subject to numerous air pollution control laws, including the federal Clean Air Act, as well as state and local statutes.  These laws and regulations cover, among other pollutants, those contributing to the formation of ground-level ozone, CO2, sulfur dioxide (SO2), mono-nitrogen oxide (NOx), particulate matter, and other GHG emissions.




In December 2009, the EPA concluded that GHG emissions contribute to climate change and issued a finding that GHG emissions cause or contribute to air pollution that endangers public health and welfare.  In May 2014, the United States released its third National Climate Assessment, which stated that the global climate is changing and that impacts related to climate change are already evident in many sectors and are expected to become increasingly disruptive across the nation throughout this century and beyond.




Federal Regulation.  At the federal level, the EPA is charged with implementation and enforcement of the Clean Air Act.  Although there have been several legislative attempts to address climate change through imposition of nationwide regulatory limits on GHG emissions, comprehensive federal legislation has not yet been enacted.  In the absence of federal legislative action, the EPA has used its existing authority under the Clean Air Act to address GHG emissions.




In January 2014, the EPA published draft regulations under section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act to control CO­2, the most common GHG, from new fossil fuel-fired power plants.  While these draft regulations as presently written do not apply to the Utility’s power plants, it is possible that the final regulations may affect the design, construction, operation and cost of future fossil fuel-fired power plants.  The EPA is expected to issue final regulations in 2015.






  



15







  



In June 2014, the EPA published draft federal regulations under section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act that are designed to reduce CO2 emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired power plants on a national basis by as much as 30% by 2030, compared with 2005 levels.  The EPA is expected to issue final regulations in 2015.  As proposed, once the EPA has finalized regulations, states have up to two or three years to submit final plans depending on whether they work alone or in partnership with other states, and up to 15 years for full implementation of all emission reduction measures.  It is uncertain whether and how these federal regulations will ultimately impact California, since existing state regulation currently requires, among other things, the gradual reduction of state-wide GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.  As described below, the Utility expects all costs and revenues associated with the state-wide, comprehensive cap-and-trade program to be passed through to customers.




State Regulation.  California law requires the gradual reduction of state-wide GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.  The CARB has approved various regulations to implement AB 32, including GHG emissions reporting and a state-wide, comprehensive cap-and-trade program that sets gradually declining limits (or “caps”) on the amount of GHGs that may be emitted by major GHG emission sources within different sectors of the economy.  The cap–and-trade program’s first compliance period, which began on January 1, 2013, applied to the electricity generation and large industrial sectors.  The next compliance period, which began on January 1, 2015, expanded to include the natural gas and transportation sectors, effectively covering all the economy’s major sectors until 2020.  The Utility’s compliance obligation as a natural gas supplier applies to the GHG emissions attributable to the combustion of natural gas delivered to the Utility’s customers other than natural gas delivery customers that are separately regulated as covered entities and have their own compliance obligation.  During each year of the program, the CARB issues emission allowances (i.e., the rights to emit GHGs) equal to the amount of GHG emissions allowed for that year.  Emitters can obtain allowances from the CARB at quarterly auctions or from third parties or exchanges.  Emitters may also satisfy a portion of their compliance obligation through the purchase of offset credits; e.g., credits for GHG reductions achieved by third parties (such as landowners, livestock owners, and farmers) that occur outside of the emitters’ facilities through CARB-qualified offset projects such as reforestation or biomass projects.  The Utility expects all costs and revenues associated with the GHG cap-and-trade program to be passed through to customers.  The California RPS program that requires the utilities to gradually increase the amount of renewable energy delivered to their customers is also expected to help reduce GHG emissions in California.




Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies. During 2014, the Utility continued its programs to develop strategies to mitigate the impact of the Utility’s operations (including customer energy usage) on the environment and to plan for the actions that it will need to take to adapt to the likely impacts of climate change on the Utility’s future operations.  The Utility regularly reviews the most relevant scientific literature on climate change such as sea level rise, temperature changes, rainfall and runoff patterns, and wildfire risk, to help the Utility identify and evaluate climate change-related risks and develop the necessary adaptation strategies.  The Utility also engages with leaders from business, government, academia, and non-profit organizations to share information and plan for the future.




With respect to electric operations, climate scientists project that, sometime in the next several decades, climate change will lead to increased electricity demand due to more extreme, persistent, and frequent hot weather.  The Utility believes its strategies to reduce GHG emissions—through energy efficiency and demand response programs, infrastructure improvements, and the use of renewable energy and energy storage—are effective strategies for adapting to the expected increase in demand for electricity.  The Utility’s vegetation management activities also reduce the risk of wildfire impacts on electric and gas facilities.  Over the long-term, the Utility also faces the risk of higher flooding potential at coastal and low elevation facilities due to sea level rise.




Climate scientists also predict that climate change will result in significant reductions in snowpack in parts of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.  This could, in turn, affect the Utility’s hydroelectric generation.  To plan for this potential change, the Utility is engaging with state and local stakeholders and also adopting strategies such as maintaining higher winter carryover reservoir storage levels, reducing discretionary reservoir water releases, and developing new modeling tools for forecasting runoff.




With respect to natural gas operations, both safety-related pipeline strength testing and normal pipeline maintenance and operations release the GHG methane into the atmosphere.  The Utility has taken steps to reduce the release of methane by implementing techniques including drafting and cross-compression, which reduce the pressure and volume of natural gas within pipelines prior to venting.  In addition, the Utility continues to replace a substantial portion of its older cast iron, steel and plastic distribution pipelines and steel gas transmission mains with new pipe, which reduces leakage.

Emissions Data




PG&E Corporation and the Utility track and report their annual environmental performance results across a broad spectrum of areas.  The Utility reports its GHG emissions to the CARB and the EPA on a mandatory basis. On a voluntary basis, The Utility reports a more comprehensive emissions inventory to The Climate Registry, a non-profit organization.  The Utility’s third-party verified voluntary GHG inventory reported to The Climate Registry for 2013 totaled more than 57 million metric tonnes of CO­2-e, two-thirds of which came from natural gas use.  The following table shows the 2013 GHG emissions data the Utility reported to the CARB under AB 32. PG&E Corporation and the Utility publish additional GHG emissions data in their annual Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Report.

The Utility’s compliance obligation under AB 32 (discussed above under “State Regulation”) applies to the combustion of natural gas delivered to customers other than customers that have their own compliance obligation. Excluding the GHG emissions of entities that have their own compliance obligation, the Utility’s GHG emissions for 2013 were approximately 19 million metric tonnes, as calculated by the CARB.

 

                    The following table shows the Utility’s third-party-verified CO2 emissions rate associated with the electricity delivered to customers in 2013 as compared to the national and California averages for electric utilities:

(2) Since the Utility purchases a portion of its electricity from the wholesale market, the Utility is not able to track some of its delivered electricity back to a specific generator.  Therefore, there is some unavoidable uncertainty in the Utility’s emissions rate.

 

Air Emissions Data for Utility-Owned Generation




In addition to GHG emissions data provided above, the table below sets forth information about the air emissions from the Utility’s owned generation facilities.  The Utility’s owned generation (primarily nuclear and hydroelectric facilities) comprised approximately 36.4% of the Utility’s delivered electricity in 2013.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility also publish air emissions data in their annual Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Report.

Water Quality




On May 19, 2014, the EPA issued final regulations to implement the requirements of the federal Clean Water Act that require cooling water intake structures at electric power plants, such as the nuclear generation facilities at Diablo Canyon, to reflect the best technology available to minimize adverse environmental impacts.  The federal regulations provide more flexibility in complying with some of the Clean Water Act’s requirements.  Various industry and environmental groups have challenged the federal regulations in proceedings pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.  California’s once-through cooling policy discussed below is considered to be at least as stringent as the new federal regulations.  Therefore, California’s implementation process for the state policy will likely continue without any significant change.

 

At the state level, the California Water Board has adopted a policy on once-through cooling that generally requires the installation of cooling towers or other significant measures to reduce the impact on marine life from existing power generation facilities in California by at least 85%.  The California Water Board has appointed a committee to evaluate the feasibility and cost of using alternative technologies to achieve compliance at Diablo Canyon.  The committee’s consultant submitted its final report to the California Water Board in September 2014 and the board is expected to issue a final decision regarding Diablo Canyon’s compliance with the state policy in 2015.  If the California Water Board requires the installation of cooling towers that the Utility believes are not technically or economically feasible, the Utility may be forced to cease operations at Diablo Canyon and may incur a material charge.  Even if the Utility is not required to install cooling towers, it could incur significant costs to comply with alternative compliances measures or to make payments to support various environmental mitigation projects. The Utility would seek to recover such costs in rates.  The Utility’s Diablo Canyon operations must be in compliance with the California Water Board’s policy by December 31, 2024.




The final requirements of the federal and state cooling water policies could affect future negotiations between the Central Coast Board and the Utility regarding the status of the 2003 settlement agreement.  (See “Diablo Canyon Power Plant” in Item 3. Legal Proceedings below.)




Nuclear Fuel Disposal




Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the DOE and electric utilities with commercial nuclear power plants were authorized to enter into contracts under which the DOE would be required to dispose of the utilities’ spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste by January 1998, in exchange for fees paid by the utilities’ customers.  The DOE has been unable to meet its contractual obligation with the Utility to dispose of nuclear waste from the Utility’s two nuclear generating units at Diablo Canyon and the retired nuclear facility at Humboldt Bay.  As a result, the Utility constructed interim dry cask storage facilities to store its spent fuel onsite at Diablo Canyon and at Humboldt Bay until such time as the DOE fulfills its contractual obligation to take possession of the spent fuel.  The Utility and other nuclear power plant owners sued the DOE to recover the costs that they incurred to construct interim storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel. 




In September 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Utility executed a settlement agreement that awarded the Utility $266 million for spent fuel storage costs incurred through December 31, 2010.  The settlement agreement also provided a claims process by which the Utility submits annual requests for reimbursement of its ongoing spent fuel storage costs.  In 2013 and 2014, the Utility was awarded an additional $50 million for costs incurred between 2011 and July 2014.  These proceeds are being refunded to customers through rates.  The settlement agreement, as amended, does not address costs incurred for spent fuel storage beyond 2016 and such costs could be subject to future litigation.  Considerable uncertainty continues to exist regarding when and whether the DOE will meet its contractual obligation to the Utility and other nuclear power plant owners to dispose of spent fuel.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS




PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual results and are often beyond their control.  (Also see Cautionary Language Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in Item 7. MD&A.)  In addition to other disclosures within this Form 10-K, including MD&A in Item 7 and Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 and other documents filed with the SEC from time to time, the following key risk factors should be considered in evaluating an investment in PG&E Corporation and the Utility.  Such factors could affect actual results of operations and cause results to differ substantially from historical results or from results that are currently sought.

 

Risks Related to the Outcome of Enforcement Matters, Investigations, and Regulatory Proceedings




PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could be materially affected by the outcomes of the CPUC investigative enforcement proceedings pending against the Utility, the federal criminal prosecution of the Utility, and the investigations and other potential enforcement matters discussed in Item 7. MD&A.




In September 2014, the CPUC ALJs overseeing the three investigative enforcement proceedings against the Utility issued a decision to impose total penalties of $1.4 billion on the Utility based on their findings that the Utility committed approximately 3,700 violations of natural gas regulations.  The Utility and other parties have appealed these decisions.  (See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters – Pending CPUC Investigations” in Item 7. MD&A.)  The CPUC could issue a final decision that imposes a materially higher amount of penalties.  The impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s consolidated financial statements will vary depending on the forms and amounts of penalties imposed.




Further, if the Utility is convicted of the pending federal criminal charges, the Utility could be required to pay a material amount of fines. Based on the superseding indictment’s allegations, the maximum alternative fine would be approximately $1.13 billion.  (See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters – Federal Criminal Indictment” in Item 7. MD&A.)  The Utility also could incur a material amount of costs to comply with remedial measures that the CPUC or a federal judge may impose on the Utility, such as a requirement that the Utility’s natural gas operations be supervised by a third-party monitor.




The CPUC could impose penalties or take other enforcement action with respect to communications that may have violated the CPUC’s rules regarding ex parte communications (See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters – Improper CPUC Communications” in Item 7. MD&A.)  In response to the Utility’s violations of the CPUC’s rules regarding ex parte communications relating to the 2015 GT&S rate case, the CPUC issued a decision to disallow up to the entire amount of incremental revenues that would have been collected from ratepayers over the five-month period between March 2015 and August 2015.  The exact amount of the revenue disallowance will be determined in the CPUC’s final decision in the 2015 GT&S rate case.  See “Ratemaking and Other Regulatory Proceedings – 2015 Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case” in Item 7. MD&A.  Federal and state law enforcement authorities have begun investigations in connection with these matters and they could take enforcement action in the future.  The Utility could be subject to additional penalties or reputational harm if it fails to comply with the restrictions on communications between the Utility and the CPUC imposed by the CPUC in November 2014.




In addition, the Utility could incur material charges, including fines and other penalties, in connection with the new CPUC investigation of the Utility’s compliance with natural gas distribution record-keeping practices, the self-reports the Utility has submitted to the CPUC in accordance with the SED’s gas safety citation program, the SED’s audit findings, the other matters discussed in “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Item 7. MD&A, and other self-reports the Utility may file under the gas safety program or under the new electric safety program.




The Utility could be subject to additional regulatory or governmental enforcement action with respect to compliance with federal, state or local laws, regulations or orders that could result in additional fines, penalties or customer refunds, including those regarding renewable energy and resource adequacy requirements; customer billing; customer service; affiliate transactions; vegetation management; design, construction, operating and maintenance practices; safety and inspection practices; and federal electric reliability standards.  The amount of such fines, penalties, or customer refunds could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results.






  



19







  



PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results depend upon the amount of revenues the Utility is authorized to collect through rates and the Utility’s ability to manage its operating expenses so that it is able to earn its authorized rate of return in a timely manner.




As a regulated entity, the Utility’s rates are set by the CPUC or the FERC on a prospective basis and are generally designed to allow the Utility to collect sufficient revenues to recover the costs of providing service, including a return on and of its capital investments.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could be materially affected if the CPUC or the FERC does not authorize sufficient revenues for the Utility to safely and reliably serve its customers and earn its authorized ROE.  The outcome of the Utility’s ratemaking proceedings can be affected by many factors, including the level of opposition by intervening parties; general economic conditions and potential rate impacts; increasing levels of regulatory review; changes in the political, regulatory, or legislative environments; and the opinions of the Utility’s regulators, consumer and other stakeholder organizations, and customers, about the Utility’s ability to provide safe, reliable, and affordable electric and gas services.  As the Utility’s reputation continues to suffer from the negative media coverage of the ongoing enforcement proceedings, the risk of adverse regulatory outcomes may increase.  In addition, the restrictions on communications between the Utility and the CPUC imposed by the CPUC in November 2014 prevent the Utility from fully participating in the regulatory process, which, in turn may affect regulatory outcomes.  The Utility’s relationship with the CPUC also may be negatively affected depending on what, if any, future action may be taken, or negative media coverage that may be generated, in response to the release of approximately 65,000 emails between the Utility and the CPUC to the CPUC and the City of San Bruno.

 

In addition to the amount of authorized revenues, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could be materially affected if the Utility’s actual costs to safely and reliably serve its customers differ from authorized or forecast costs.  The Utility may incur additional costs for many reasons including changing market circumstances, unanticipated events (such as storms, accidents, catastrophic or other events affecting the Utility’s operations), or compliance with new state laws or policies.  Although the Utility may be allowed to recover some or all of the additional costs, there may be a substantial time lag between when the Utility incurs the costs and when the Utility is authorized to collect revenues to recover such costs.  Alternatively, the CPUC or the FERC may disallow costs that they determine were not reasonably or prudently incurred by the Utility.

 

The Utility’s ability to recover its costs also may be affected by the economy and the economy’s corresponding impact on the Utility’s customers.  For example, a sustained downturn or sluggishness in the economy could reduce the Utility’s sales to industrial and commercial customers or the level of uncollectible bills could increase.  Although the Utility generally recovers its costs through rates, regardless of sales volume, rate pressures increase when the costs are borne by a smaller sales base.




Changes in commodity prices also may have an adverse effect on the Utility’s ability to timely recover its operating costs and earn its authorized ROE.  Although the Utility generally recovers its electricity and natural gas procurement costs from customers as “pass-through” costs, a significant and sustained rise in commodity prices could create overall rate pressures that make it more difficult for the Utility to recover its costs that are not categorized as “pass-through” costs.  To relieve some of this upward rate pressure, the CPUC could authorize lower revenues than the Utility requested or disallow full cost recovery.  Further, should the deployment of new electricity generation and energy storage technologies spread and become more cost-effective, the Utility’s ability to recover its investments and earn its authorized ROE could be adversely affected unless rates are appropriately adjusted.  Also, a confluence of technology-related cost declines and sustained federal or state subsidies could make a combination of distributed generation and energy storage a viable, cost-effective alternative to the Utility’s bundled electric service, which could further threaten the Utility’s ability to recover its generation, transmission, and distribution investments.




PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s future financial results could be materially affected by the extent to which its natural gas transmission costs exceed authorized revenues and whether the Utility is able to continue using regulatory accounting for its natural gas transmission business.




The Utility’s ability to recover its natural gas transmission and storage costs in 2015, 2016, and 2017 and earn its authorized ROE will be materially affected by the amount of revenues the CPUC ultimately authorizes the Utility to collect in the 2015 GT&S rate case proceeding.  (See “Ratemaking and Other Regulatory Proceedings” in Item 7. MD&A.)  In addition, the Utility plans to perform certain work during 2015 through 2017, including work to complete projects under the PSEP and to identify and remove encroachments from gas transmission pipeline rights-of-way.  The Utility has not sought to recover the costs it incurs to perform this work.  Actual costs to perform this work could materially exceed forecasts and negatively affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s results of operations.  The Utility expects that it will continue to incur costs to respond to public opposition to the Utility’s work to remove trees and other encroachments. The media attention to the Utility’s encroachment work also may negatively affect the Utility’s reputation.






  



20







  



If rates in the 2015 GT&S rate case and future rate cases are not set at a level that allows the Utility to recover the cost of providing natural gas transmission service and a reasonable return on its investment in future periods, the Utility may be required to discontinue the application of regulatory accounting to its natural gas transmission business.  (See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 as well as "Critical Accounting Policies" in Item 7. MD&A.)  If that occurs, the regulatory assets and liabilities that do not qualify for regulatory accounting treatment would be charged against income in the period in which that determination was made and these charges could have a material impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results.  In addition, if regulatory accounting did not apply, the Utility’s future financial results could become more volatile as compared to historical financial results due to the differences in the timing of expense or gain recognition.




PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results depend upon the Utility’s continuing ability to recover “pass-through” costs, including electricity and natural gas procurement costs, from customers  in a timely manner.  The CPUC may disallow procurement costs for a variety of reasons. In addition, the Utility’s ability to recover these costs could be affected by the loss of Utility customers and decreased new customer growth, if the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility’s rates to reflect such events.




The Utility meets customer demand for electricity from a variety of sources, including electricity generated from the Utility’s own generation facilities, electricity provided by third parties under power purchase agreements, and purchases on the wholesale electricity market.  The Utility must manage these sources using the commercial and CPUC regulatory principles of “least cost dispatch” and prudent administration of power purchase agreements in compliance with its CPUC-approved long-term procurement plan.  The CPUC could disallow procurement costs incurred by the Utility if the CPUC determines that the Utility did not comply with these principles or if the Utility did not comply with its procurement plan.  Further, the contractual prices for electricity under the Utility’s power purchase agreements could become uneconomic in the future for a variety of reasons, including developments in alternative energy technology, increased self-generation by customers, an increase in distributed generation, and lower customer demand due to adverse economic conditions or the loss of the Utility’s customers to other generation providers.  Despite original CPUC approval of the contracts, the CPUC could disallow contract costs if it determines that the costs are unreasonably above market.  The Utility also could incur a CPUC disallowance and/or liability to the counterparties under its contracts to procure electricity from conventional and renewable generation resources if such resources are physically curtailed by the CAISO during periods of over-generation when generation resources scheduled with the CAISO exceed customer load.




The Utility’s ability to recover the costs it incurs in the wholesale electricity market may be affected by the whether the wholesale electricity market in California continues to function effectively.  Although market mechanisms are designed to limit excessive prices, these market mechanisms could fail, or the related systems and software on which the market mechanisms rely may not perform as intended which could result in excessive market prices.  The CPUC could prohibit the Utility from passing through the higher costs of electricity to customers.  For example, during the 2000 and 2001 energy crisis, the market mechanism flaws in California’s then-newly established wholesale electricity market led to dramatically high market prices for electricity that the Utility was unable to recover through customer rates, ultimately causing the Utility to file a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.




Further, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could be affected by the loss of Utility customers and decreased new customer growth that occurs through municipalization of the Utility’s facilities, an increase in the number of CCAs who provide electricity to their residents, and an increase in the number of consumers who become direct access customers of alternative generation providers.  (See “Competition in the Electric Industry” in Item 1.)  As the number of bundled customers (i.e., those primarily residential customers who receive electricity and distribution service from the Utility) declines, the rates for remaining customers could increase as the Utility would have a smaller customer base from which to recover its procurement costs.  Although the Utility is permitted to collect non-bypassable charges for generation-related costs incurred on behalf of former customers, as well as charges for distribution, metering, or other services the Utility continues to provide to such customers, the charges may not be sufficient for the Utility to fully recover the costs to provide these services.  In addition, the Utility’s ability to collect non-bypassable charges has been, and may continue to be, challenged by certain customer groups.  Furthermore, if the former customers return to receiving electricity supply from the Utility, the Utility could incur costs to meet their electricity needs that it may not be able to timely recover through rates or that it may not be able to recover at all.






  



21







  



In addition, increasing levels of self-generation of electricity by customers (primarily solar installations) and the use of customer net energy metering, which allows self-generating customers to receive bill credits for surplus power at the full retail rate, could put upward rate pressure on remaining customers.  Also, a confluence of technology-related cost declines and sustained federal or state subsidies could make a combination of distributed generation and energy storage a viable, cost-effective alternative to the Utility’s bundled electric service which could further threaten the Utility’s ability to recover its generation, transmission, and distribution investments.  If the number of the Utility’s customers decreases or grows at a slower rate than anticipated, the Utility’s level of capital investment would likely decline as well, in turn leading to a slower growth in rate base and earnings.  Reduced energy demand or significantly slowed growth in demand due to customer migration to other energy providers, adoption of energy efficient technology, conservation, increasing levels of distributed generation and self-generation, unless substantially offset through regulatory cost allocations, could adversely impact PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results.




PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could be materially affected if the Utility is unable to recover a material portion of its procurement costs and/or if the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility’s rates to reflect the impact of changing loads, the wide deployment of distributed generation, and the development of new electricity generation and energy storage technologies.




Risks Related to Liquidity and Capital Requirements




PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results will be affected by their ability to continue accessing the capital markets and by the terms of debt and equity financings.




PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to access the capital and credit markets and the costs and terms of available financing depend on many factors, including the ultimate outcome of the matters discussed under “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Item 7. MD&A., the ultimate amount of costs the Utility incurs but does not recover through rates, and the outcome of pending and future ratemaking proceedings.  These outcomes in turn can affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s credit ratings and outlook.  If PG&E Corporation’s or the Utility’s credit ratings were downgraded to below investment grade, their ability to access the capital and credit markets would be negatively affected and could result in higher borrowing costs, fewer financing options, including reduced access to the commercial paper market, additional collateral posting requirements, which in turn could affect liquidity and lead to an increased financing need.  Other factors can affect the availability and terms of debt and equity financing, including changes in the federal or state regulatory environment affecting energy companies generally or PG&E Corporation and the Utility in particular, the overall health of the energy industry, volatility in electricity or natural gas prices, and general economic and financial market conditions.




The reputations of PG&E Corporation and the Utility continue to suffer from the negative publicity about the CPUC investigations, the criminal investigations, the criminal prosecution, and the other pending enforcement matters.  Their negative reputations and continuing uncertainty surrounding the outcomes of these matters may undermine investors’ confidence in management’s ability to execute its business strategy and restore a constructive regulatory environment.  As a result, investors may be less willing to buy shares of PG&E Corporation common stock resulting in a lower stock price.  Further, the market price of PG&E Corporation common stock could decline materially after the outcomes are determined.  The amount and timing of future share issuances also could affect the stock price.  Declines in the stock price would increase the dilutive effect of future stock issuances and make it more difficult or expensive for PG&E Corporation to complete future equity offerings.




If the Utility were unable to access the capital markets, it could be required to decrease or suspend dividends to PG&E Corporation and PG&E Corporation could be required to contribute capital to the Utility to enable the Utility to fulfill its obligation to serve.  To maintain PG&E Corporation’s dividend level in these circumstances, PG&E Corporation would be further required to access the capital or credit markets.  PG&E Corporation may need to decrease or discontinue its common stock dividend if it is unable to access the capital or credit markets on reasonable terms.






  



22







  



PG&E Corporation’s ability to meet its debt service and other financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock depends on the Utility’s earnings and cash flows.




PG&E Corporation is a holding company with no revenue generating operations of its own. The Utility must use its resources to satisfy its own obligations, including its obligation to serve customers, to pay principal and interest on outstanding debt, to pay preferred stock dividends, and meet its obligations to employees and creditors, before it can distribute cash to PG&E Corporation.  Under the CPUC’s rules applicable to utility holding companies, the Utility’s dividend policy must be established by the Utility's Board of Directors as though the Utility were a stand-alone utility company and PG&E Corporation’s Board of Directors give “first priority” to the Utility’s capital requirements, as determined to be necessary and prudent to meet the Utility’s obligation to serve or to operate the Utility in a prudent and efficient manner.  The CPUC has interpreted this “first priority” obligation to include the requirement that PG&E Corporation “infuse the Utility with all types of capital necessary for the Utility to fulfill its obligation to serve.”  In addition, before the Utility can pay common stock dividends to PG&E Corporation, the Utility must maintain its authorized capital structure with an average 52% equity component.






Depending on the outcome of the CPUC investigations, criminal prosecution, and other enforcement matters pending against the Utility, future issuances of PG&E Corporation common stock may materially dilute EPS.  (See “Liquidity and Financial Resources” in Item 7. MD&A.)  Further, if PG&E Corporation were required to infuse the Utility with significant capital or if the Utility was unable to distribute cash to PG&E Corporation, or both, PG&E Corporation may be unable to pay principal and interest on its outstanding debt, pay its common stock dividend or meet other obligations.






PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to pay dividends also could be affected by financial covenants contained in their respective credit agreements that require each company to maintain a ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated capitalization of at most 65%.




Risks Related to Operations and Information Technology




The operations of the Utility’s electricity and natural gas generation, transmission, and distribution facilities is inherently dangerous and involves significant risks which, if they materialize, can adversely affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results, and the Utility’s insurance may not be sufficient to cover losses caused by an operating failure or catastrophic event.




The Utility owns and operates extensive electricity and natural gas facilities, including two nuclear generation units and an extensive hydroelectric generating system.  (See “Utility Operations” in Item 1. Business.)  The Utility’s ability to earn its authorized ROE depends on its ability to efficiently maintain, operate, and protect its facilities, and provide electricity and natural gas services safely and reliably.  The Utility undertakes substantial capital investment projects to construct, replace, and improve its electricity and natural gas facilities.  In addition, the Utility is obligated to decommission its electricity generation facilities at the end of their useful operating lives.  The Utility’s ability to safely and reliably operate, maintain, construct and decommission its facilities is subject to numerous risks, many of which are beyond the Utility’s control, including those that arise from:

 





·


the breakdown or failure of equipment, electric transmission or distribution lines, or natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines, that can cause explosions, fires, or other catastrophic events (such as the San Bruno accident discussed  in  Item 7. MD&A.);


  
  


·


the release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic activity, natural disaster, or terrorist act;


  
  


·


the failure of a large dam or other major hydroelectric facility, or the failure of one or more levees that protect land on which the Utility’s assets are built;

 



·


the failure to take expeditious or sufficient action to mitigate operating conditions, facilities, or equipment, that the Utility has identified, or reasonably should have identified, as unsafe, which failure then leads to a catastrophic event (such as a wild land fire or natural gas explosion), and the failure to respond effectively to a catastrophic event;

 



·


severe weather events such as storms, tornadoes, floods, drought, earthquakes, tsunamis, wild land and other fires, pandemics, solar events, electromagnetic events, or other natural disasters;

 



·


operator or other human error;

 



·


construction performed by third parties, such as ground excavation or “dig-ins” that damage the Utility’s underground facilities;

 



·

 


the release of hazardous or toxic substances into the air, water, or soil; and

 



·


attacks by third parties, including cyber-attacks, acts of terrorism, vandalism, or war.









  



23







  



The occurrence of any of these events could interrupt fuel supplies; affect demand for electricity or natural gas; cause unplanned outages or reduce generating output; damage the Utility’s assets or operations; damage the assets or operations of third parties on which the Utility relies; damage property owned by customers or others; and cause personal injury or death.  As a result, the Utility could incur costs to purchase replacement power, to repair assets and restore service, to compensate third parties, or to pay penalties or implement remedial measures.  These costs may not be recoverable through rates or insurance and could have a material impact of PG&E Corporation’s financial results and reputation.  As an example, see the discussion in Item 7. MD&A. of the Utility’s unrecovered pipeline-related costs incurred since the San Bruno accident.




Further, although the Utility often enters into agreements for third-party contractors to perform work, such as patrolling and inspection of facilities or the construction or demolition or facilities, the Utility may retain liability for the quality and completion of the contractor’s work and can be subject to penalties or other enforcement action if the contractor violates applicable laws, rules, regulations, or orders.  Insurance, equipment warranties, or other contractual indemnification requirements may not be sufficient or effective to provide full or even partial recovery under all circumstances or against all hazards or liabilities to which the Utility may become subject.  An uninsured loss could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results.  Future insurance coverage may not be available at rates and on terms as favorable as the Utility’s current insurance coverage or may not be available at all.




The Utility’s operational and information technology systems could fail to function properly or be damaged by third parties (including cyber-attacks and acts of terrorism), severe weather, natural disasters, or other events. Any of these events could disrupt the Utility’s operations and cause the Utility to incur unanticipated losses and expense or liability to third parties.




The operation of the Utility’s extensive electricity and natural gas systems rely on evolving information and operational technology systems and network infrastructures that are becoming more complex as new technologies and systems are implemented to modernize capabilities to safely and reliably deliver gas and electric services.  The Utility’s ability to serve its customers requires the continued operation of complex information technology systems and network infrastructure that are interconnected with the systems and infrastructure owned by third parties.  The Utility’s business is highly dependent on its ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a very large number of tasks and transactions, many of which are highly complex.  Despite implementation of security measures, all of the Utility’s technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism and other causes.  The failure of the Utility’s information and operational systems and networks due to a physical attack, cyber-attack or other cause could significantly disrupt operations; cause harm to the public or employees; result in outages or reduced generating output; damage the Utility’s assets or operations or those of third parties; and subject the Utility to claims by customers or third parties, any of which could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results.




The Utility’s systems, including its financial information, operational systems, advanced metering, and billing systems, require ongoing maintenance, modification, and updating, which can be costly and increase the risk of errors and malfunction.  The Utility often relies on third-party vendors to maintain, modify, and update its systems and these third-party vendors could cease to exist.  Any disruptions or deficiencies in existing systems, or disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the modification or implementation of new systems, could result in increased costs, the inability to track or collect revenues, the diversion of management’s and employees’ attention and resources, and could negatively affect the effectiveness of the Utility’s control environment, and/or the Utility’s ability to timely file required regulatory reports. 




In addition, the Utility’s information systems contain confidential information, including information about customers and employees.  The theft, damage, or improper disclosure of confidential information can subject the Utility to penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws, subject the Utility to claims from third parties, reduce the value of proprietary information, and harm the Utility’s reputation.






  



24







  



The operation and decommissioning of the Utility’s nuclear power plants expose it to potentially significant liabilities and the Utility may not be able to fully recover its costs if regulatory requirements change or the plant ceases operations before the licenses expire.




The operation of the Utility’s nuclear generation facilities exposes it to potentially significant liabilities from environmental, health and financial risks, such as risks relating to the storage, handling and disposal of spent nuclear fuel, the release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic activity, natural disaster, or terrorist act.  The operation of the nuclear facilities also depends on the availability of adequate fuel supplies.  If the Utility incurs losses that are either not covered by insurance or exceed the amount of insurance available, such losses could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results.  In addition, the Utility may be required under federal law to pay up to $255 million of liabilities arising out of each nuclear incident occurring not only at the Utility’s Diablo Canyon facility but at any other nuclear power plant in the United States.  (See Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)  




In addition, the Utility continues to face public concern about the safety of nuclear generation and nuclear fuel.  Some of these nuclear opposition groups regularly file petitions at the NRC and in other forums challenging the actions of the NRC and urging governmental entities to adopt laws or policies in opposition to nuclear power.  Although an action in opposition may ultimately fail, regulatory proceedings may take longer to conclude and be more costly to complete.  It is also possible that public pressure could grow and that future changes in legislation, regulations, orders, or their interpretation, could result in the Utility ceasing operations at Diablo Canyon before the licenses expire.  In such an instance, the Utility could be required to record a charge for the remaining amount of its unrecovered investment and such charge could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation and the Utility’s financial results.




The Utility has incurred, and may continue to incur, substantial costs to comply with NRC regulations and orders.  (See “Regulatory Environment” in Item 1. Business.)  If the Utility were unable to recover these costs, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could be materially affected.  The Utility may determine that it cannot comply with the new regulations or orders in a feasible and economic manner and voluntarily cease operations; alternatively, the NRC may order the Utility to cease operations until it can comply with new regulations, orders, or decisions.  The Utility may incur a material charge if it ceases operations at Diablo Canyon before the licenses expire.




At the state level, the California Water Board has adopted a policy on once-through cooling that generally requires the installation of cooling towers or other significant measures to reduce the impact on marine life from existing power generation facilities in California by at least 85%.  If the California Water Board requires the installation of cooling towers that the Utility believes are not technically or economically feasible, the Utility may be forced to cease operations at Diablo Canyon and may incur a material charge.  Even if the Utility is not required to install cooling towers, it could incur significant costs to comply with alternative compliances measures or to make payments to support various environmental mitigation projects.




The Utility also has an obligation to decommission its electricity generation facilities, including its nuclear facilities, as well as gas transmission system assets, at the end of their useful lives.  (See Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Asset Retirement Obligations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement in Item 8.)  The CPUC authorizes the Utility to recover its estimated costs to decommission its nuclear facilities through nuclear decommissioning charges that are collected from customers and held in nuclear decommissioning trusts to be used for the eventual decommissioning of each nuclear unit.  If the Utility’s actual decommissioning costs, including the amounts held in the nuclear decommissioning trusts, exceed estimated costs, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could be materially affected.

Risks Related to Environmental Factors




The Utility’s operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and changes in or liabilities under these laws could adversely affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results.




The Utility’s operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws, regulations, orders, relating to air quality, water quality and usage, remediation of hazardous wastes, and the protection and conservation of natural resources and wildlife.  The Utility incurs significant capital, operating, and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental statutes, rules, and regulations.  The Utility has been, and may be, required to pay for environmental remediation costs at sites where it is identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws.  Although the Utility has recorded liabilities for known environmental obligations, these costs can be difficult to estimate due to uncertainties about the extent of contamination, remediation alternatives, the applicable remediation levels, and the financial ability of other potentially responsible parties.  (See Note 14 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for more information.)




Environmental remediation costs could increase in the future as a result of new legislation, the current trend toward more stringent standards, and stricter and more expansive application of existing environmental regulations.  Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or failure to comply with the terms of licenses or permits issued by environmental or regulatory agencies, could expose the Utility to claims by third parties or the imposition of civil or criminal fines or other sanctions.




The CPUC has authorized the Utility to recover its environmental remediation costs for certain sites through various ratemaking mechanisms.  One of these mechanisms allows the Utility rate recovery for 90% of its hazardous substance remediation costs for certain approved sites without a reasonableness review. The CPUC may discontinue or change these ratemaking mechanisms in the future or the Utility may incur environmental costs that exceed amounts the CPUC has authorized the Utility to recover in rates.




Some of the Utility’s environmental costs, such as the remediation costs associated with the Hinkley natural gas compressor site, are not recoverable through rates or insurance.  (See “Environmental Regulation” in Item 1.) The Utility’s costs to remediate groundwater contamination near the Hinkley natural gas compressor site and to abate the effects of the contamination have had, and may continue to have, a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results.  Their financial results also can be materially affected by changes in estimated costs and by the extent to which actual remediation costs differ from recorded liabilities.




The Utility’s future operations may be affected by climate change that may have a material impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.




The Utility has been studying the potential effects of climate change (increased temperatures, reduced precipitation, rising sea levels) on the Utility’s operations and is developing contingency plans to adapt to those events and conditions that the Utility believes are most significant.  Scientists project that climate change will increase electricity demand due to more extreme, persistent and hot weather.  Increasing temperatures and lower levels of precipitation in the Utility’s service territory would reduce snowpack in the Sierra Mountains.  If the levels of snowpack were reduced, the Utility’s hydroelectric generation would decrease and the Utility would need to acquire additional generation from other sources at a greater cost.  Should the Utility increase reliance on conventional generation resources to replace hydroelectric generation and to meet increased customer demand, it may become more costly for the Utility to comply with GHG emissions limits.  In addition, increasing temperatures and lower levels of precipitation could increase the occurrence of wildfires in the Utility’s service territory causing damage to the Utility’s facilities or the facilities of third parties on which the Utility relies to provide service. In addition, flooding caused by rising sea levels could damage the Utility’s facilities, including hydroelectric assets such as dams and canals, and the electric transmission assets that are located on levees throughout the Utility’s service territory.  The Utility could incur substantial costs to repair or replace facilities, restore service, compensate customers and other third parties for damages or injuries. The Utility anticipates that the increased costs would be recovered through rates, but as rate pressures increase, the likelihood of disallowance or non-recovery may increase.




Events or conditions caused by climate change could have a greater impact on the Utility’s operations than the Utility’s studies suggest and could result in lower revenues or increased expenses, or both.  If the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility’s rates to reflect the impact of events or conditions caused by climate change, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially affected.

Other Risk Factors




The Utility may be required to incur substantial costs in order to obtain or renew licenses and permits needed to operate the Utility’s business and the Utility may be subject to fines and penalties for failure to comply or obtain license renewal.




The Utility must comply with the terms of various governmental permits, authorizations, and licenses, including those issued by the FERC for the continued operation of the Utility’s hydroelectric generation facilities, and those issued by environmental and other federal, state and local governmental agencies. Many of the Utility’s capital investment projects, and some maintenance activities, often require the Utility to obtain land use, construction, environmental, or other governmental permits.  These permits, authorizations, and licenses may be difficult to obtain on a timely basis, causing work delays.  Further, existing permits and licenses could be revoked or modified by the agencies that granted them if facts develop that differ significantly from the facts assumed when they were issued.  In addition, the Utility often seeks periodic renewal of a license or permit, such as a waste discharge permit or a FERC operating license for a hydroelectric generation facility.  If a license or permit is not renewed for a particular facility and the Utility is required to cease operations at that facility, the Utility could incur an impairment charge or other costs.  Before renewing a permit or license, the issuing agency may impose additional requirements that may increase the Utility’s compliance costs.  In particular, in connection with a license renewal for one or more of the Utility’s hydroelectric generation facilities or assets, the FERC may impose new license conditions that could, among other things, require increased expenditures or result in reduced electricity output and/or capacity at the facility.  In addition, local governments may attempt to assert jurisdiction over various utility operations by requiring permits or other approvals that the Utility has not been previously required to obtain. 




The Utility may incur penalties and sanctions for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of licenses and permits which could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.  If the Utility cannot obtain, renew, or comply with necessary governmental permits, authorizations, licenses, ordinances, or other requirements, or if the Utility cannot recover the increase in associated compliance and other costs in a timely manner, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could be materially affected.




Poor investment performance or other factors could require PG&E Corporation and the Utility to make significant unplanned contributions to its pension plan, other postretirement benefits plans, and nuclear decommissioning trusts.




PG&E Corporation and the Utility provide defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits for eligible employees and retirees.  The Utility also maintains three trusts for the purposes of providing funds to decommission its nuclear facilities.  The performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of plan assets and trust assets.  A decline in the market value may increase the funding requirements for these plans and trusts.  The cost of providing pension and other postretirement benefits is also affected by other factors, including interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels, the rate of return on plan assets, employee demographics, discount rates used in determining future benefit obligations, rates of increase in health care costs, future government regulation, and prior contributions to the plans.  Similarly, funding requirements for the nuclear decommissioning trusts are affected by the rates of return on trust assets, changes in the laws or regulations regarding nuclear decommissioning or decommissioning funding requirements as well as changes in assumptions or forecasts related to decommissioning dates, technology and the cost of labor, materials and equipment.  (See Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)  If the Utility is required to make significant unplanned contributions to fund the pension and postretirement plans or if actual nuclear decommissioning costs exceed the amount of nuclear decommissioning trust funds and the Utility is unable to recover the contributions or additional costs in rates, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could be materially affected.




The Utility’s success depends on the availability of the services of a qualified workforce and its ability to maintain satisfactory collective bargaining agreements which cover a substantial number of employees.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s results may suffer if the Utility is unable to attract and retain qualified personnel and senior management talent, or if prolonged labor disruptions occur.




The Utility’s workforce is aging and many employees are or will become eligible to retire within the next few years.  Although the Utility has undertaken efforts to recruit and train new field service personnel, the Utility may be faced with a shortage of experienced and qualified personnel.  The majority of the Utility’s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with three unions.  Labor disruptions could occur depending on the outcome of negotiations to renew the terms of these agreements.  In addition, some of the remaining non-represented Utility employees could join one of these unions in the future.




PG&E Corporation and the Utility also may face challenges in attracting and retaining senior management talent especially if they are unable to restore the reputational harm generated by the negative publicity stemming from the ongoing enforcement proceedings.  Any such occurrences could negatively impact PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition and results of operations.
