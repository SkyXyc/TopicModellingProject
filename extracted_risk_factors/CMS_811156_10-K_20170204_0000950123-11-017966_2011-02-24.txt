    GENERAL


 



    CMS
    Energy


 


    CMS Energy was formed in Michigan in 1987 and is an energy
    company operating primarily in Michigan. It is the parent
    holding company of several subsidiaries, including Consumers, an
    electric and gas utility, and CMS Enterprises, primarily a
    domestic IPP. Consumers serves individuals and businesses
    operating in the alternative energy, automotive, chemical,
    metal, and food products industries, as well as a diversified
    group of other industries. CMS Enterprises, through its
    subsidiaries and equity investments, is engaged primarily in IPP
    and owns power generation facilities fueled mostly by natural
    gas and biomass.


 


    CMS Energy manages its businesses by the nature of services each
    provides and operates, principally in three business segments:
    electric utility, gas utility, and enterprises, its non-utility
    operations and investments. Consumers’ consolidated
    operations account for substantially all of CMS Energy’s
    total assets, income, and operating revenue. CMS Energy’s
    consolidated operating revenue was $6.4 billion in 2010,
    $6.2 billion in 2009, and $6.8 billion in 2008.


 


    For further information about operating revenue, net operating
    income, and identifiable assets and liabilities attributable to
    all of CMS Energy’s business segments and operations, see
    Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, CMS
    Energy’s Selected Financial Information, Consolidated
    Financial Statements, and Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements.


 



    Consumers


 


    Consumers has served Michigan customers since 1886. Consumers
    was incorporated in Maine in 1910 and became a Michigan
    corporation in 1968. Consumers owns and operates electric
    distribution and generation facilities and gas transmission,
    storage, and distribution facilities. It provides electricity
    and/or
    natural gas to 6.8 million of Michigan’s
    10 million residents. Consumers’ rates and certain
    other aspects of its business are subject to the jurisdiction of
    the MPSC and FERC, as described in “CMS Energy and
    Consumers Regulation” in this Item 1.


 


    Consumers’ consolidated operating revenue was
    $6.2 billion in 2010, $6.0 billion in 2009, and
    $6.4 billion in 2008. For further information about
    operating revenue, net operating income, and identifiable assets
    and liabilities attributable to Consumers’ electric and gas
    utility operations, see Item 8. Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data, Consumers’ Selected Financial
    Information, Consolidated Financial Statements, and Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements.


 


    Consumers owns its principal properties in fee, except that most
    electric lines and gas mains are located below public roads or
    on land owned by others and are accessed by Consumers through
    easements and other rights. Almost all of Consumers’
    properties are subject to the lien of its First Mortgage Bond
    Indenture. For additional information on Consumers’
    properties, see Consumers Electric Utility — Electric
    Utility Properties and Consumers Gas Utility — Gas
    Utility Properties in the “Business Segments” section
    of this Item 1.

    SEGMENTS


 



    Consumers
    Electric Utility


 


    Electric Utility Operations:  Consumers’
    electric utility operations, which include the generation,
    purchase, distribution, and sale of electricity, generated
    operating revenue of $3.8 billion in 2010,
    $3.4 billion in 2009, and $3.6 billion in 2008.
    Consumers’ electric utility customer base consists of a mix
    of residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers
    in Michigan’s Lower Peninsula. The automotive industry
    represented six percent of Consumers’ 2010 electric utility
    operating revenue. Presented in the following illustration is
    Consumers’ 2010 electric utility operating revenue of
    $3.8 billion by customer class:


 


    


 


    Consumers’ electric utility operations are not dependent on
    a single customer, or even a few customers, and the loss of any
    one or even a few of its largest customers is not reasonably
    likely to have a material adverse effect on Consumers’
    financial condition.


 


    In 2010, Consumers’ electric deliveries, excluding
    intersystem deliveries, were 38 million MWh, which included
    ROA deliveries of four million MWh, consistent with the
    ten-percent cap. Net bundled sales were 34 million MWh in
    2010. In 2009, Consumers’ electric deliveries, excluding
    intersystem deliveries, were 36 million MWh, which included
    ROA deliveries of two million MWh, resulting in net bundled
    sales of 34 million MWh.


 


    Consumers’ electric utility operations are seasonal. The
    consumption of electric energy typically increases in the summer
    months, due primarily to the use of air conditioners and other
    cooling equipment.

Table of Contents





    Presented in the following illustration are Consumers’
    monthly weather-adjusted electric deliveries (deliveries
    adjusted to reflect normal weather conditions) to its customers,
    including ROA deliveries, during 2010 and 2009:


 


    


 


    Consumers’ 2010 summer peak demand was 8,190 MW, which
    includes ROA demand of 555 MW. For the
    2009-2010
    winter period, Consumers’ peak demand was 6,093 MW,
    which includes ROA demand of 425 MW. As required by MISO
    reserve margin requirements, Consumers owns or controls, through
    long-term contracts, capacity necessary to supply its projected
    firm peak load and necessary reserve margin for summer 2011.

    In 2010, Consumers’ four coal-fueled generating sites
    burned 10 million tons of coal and produced a combined
    total of 17,879 GWh of electricity, which represented
    48 percent of the energy provided by Consumers to meet
    customer demand.


 


    In order to obtain its coal requirements, Consumers enters into
    physical coal supply contracts. At December 31, 2010,
    Consumers had contracts to purchase coal through 2013; these
    contracts total $315 million. All of Consumers’ coal
    supply contracts have fixed prices. At December 31, 2010,
    Consumers had 85 percent of its 2011 expected coal
    requirements under contract, as well as a
    41-day
    supply of coal on hand.


 


    In conjunction with its coal supply contracts, Consumers leases
    a fleet of rail cars and has long-term transportation contracts
    with various companies to provide rail and vessel services for
    delivery of purchased coal to Consumers’ generating
    facilities. Consumers’ coal transportation contracts expire
    from 2011 through 2014; these contracts total $445 million.

    Consumers participates in the Midwest Energy Market. Consumers
    offers its generation into the market on a day-ahead and
    real-time basis and bids for power in the market to serve the
    demand of its customers. Consumers is a net purchaser of power
    and supplements its generation capability with purchases from
    the market to meet its customers’ needs during peak demand
    periods.


 


    At December 31, 2010, Consumers had unrecognized future
    commitments (amounts for which liabilities, in accordance with
    GAAP, have not been recorded on its balance sheet) to purchase
    capacity and energy under long-term PPAs with various generating
    plants. These contracts require monthly capacity payments based
    on the plants’ availability or deliverability. These
    payments for 2011 through 2030 total $15.3 billion and
    range from $822 million to $1 billion annually for
    each of the next five years. These amounts may vary depending on
    plant availability and fuel costs. For further information about
    Consumers’ future capacity and energy purchase obligations,
    see Item 7. MD&A, “Capital Resources and
    Liquidity.”


 



    Consumers
    Gas Utility


 



    Gas
    Utility Operations:


 


    Consumers’ gas utility operations, which include the
    purchase, transmission, storage, distribution, and sale of
    natural gas, generated operating revenue of $2.4 billion in
    2010, $2.6 billion in 2009, and $2.8 billion in 2008.
    Consumers’ gas utility customer base consists of a mix of
    residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers in
    Michigan’s Lower Peninsula. Presented in the following
    illustration is Consumers’ 2010 gas utility operating
    revenue by customer class:


 


    


 


    Consumers’ gas utility operations are not dependent on a
    single customer, or even a few customers, and the loss of any
    one or even a few of its largest customers is not reasonably
    likely to have a material adverse effect on Consumers’
    financial condition.


 


    In 2010, deliveries of natural gas, including off-system
    transportation deliveries, through Consumers’ pipeline and
    distribution network totaled 317 bcf, which included GCC
    deliveries of 36 bcf. In 2009, deliveries of natural gas,
    including off-system transportation deliveries, through
    Consumers’ pipeline and distribution network totaled 319
    bcf, which included GCC deliveries of 27 bcf. Consumers’
    gas utility operations are seasonal. Consumers injects natural
    gas into storage during the summer months for use during the
    winter months when the demand for natural gas is higher. Peak
    demand occurs in the winter due to colder temperatures and the
    resulting use of natural gas as a heating fuel. During 2010,
    46 percent of the natural gas supplied to all customers
    during the winter months





    
    21

    was supplied from storage. Presented in the following
    illustration are Consumers’ monthly weather-adjusted gas
    deliveries to its customers, including GCC deliveries, during
    2010 and 2009:


 


    


 


    Gas Utility Properties: Consumers’ gas
    distribution and transmission system located in Michigan’s
    Lower Peninsula consists of:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    26,585 miles of distribution mains;




 



     
        • 

    
    1,664 miles of transmission lines;




 



     
        • 

    
    seven compressor stations with a total of 150,475 installed and
    available horsepower; and




 



     
        • 

    
    15 gas storage fields with an aggregate storage capacity of 307
    bcf and a working storage capacity of 142 bcf.





 


    Gas Supply: In 2010, Consumers purchased
    61 percent of the gas it delivered from U.S. producers
    and 21 percent from Canadian producers. The remaining
    18 percent was purchased from authorized GCC suppliers and





    
    22



Table of Contents





    delivered by Consumers to customers in the GCC program.
    Presented in the following illustration are the supply
    arrangements for the gas Consumers delivered to GCC and GCR
    customers during 2010:


 


    


 


    Firm transportation or firm city-gate contracts are those that
    define a fixed amount, price, and delivery time frame.
    Consumers’ firm gas transportation contracts are with ANR
    Pipeline Company, Great Lakes Gas Transmission, L.P., Panhandle,
    Trunkline, and Vector Pipeline L.P. Under these contracts,
    Consumers purchases and transports gas to Michigan for ultimate
    delivery to its customers. Consumers’ firm gas
    transportation contracts expire through 2017 and provide for the
    delivery of 71 percent of Consumers’ total gas supply
    requirements.


 


    Consumers purchases the balance of its required gas supply under
    firm city-gate contracts and through authorized suppliers under
    the GCC program. Consumers may also utilize incremental firm
    transportation contracts and interruptible transportation
    contracts to purchase its gas supply. Under interruptible
    transportation contracts, the transportation provider is
    permitted to interrupt service. Consumers’ use of
    incremental firm transportation contracts and interruptible
    transportation contracts is generally during off-peak summer
    months and after Consumers has fully utilized the services under
    the firm transportation contracts. The amount of interruptible
    transportation service and its use vary primarily with the price
    for this service and the availability and price of purchased and
    transported spot supplies.


 



    Enterprises
    Segment — Non-Utility Operations and
    Investments


 


    CMS Energy’s enterprises segment, through various
    subsidiaries and certain equity investments, is engaged
    primarily in domestic IPP and the marketing of IPP. In 2007, the
    enterprises segment made a significant change in business
    strategy by exiting the international marketplace and refocusing
    on its independent power business in the U.S.


 


    The enterprises segment’s operating revenue included in
    Income From Continuing Operations in CMS Energy’s
    Consolidated Financial Statements was $238 million in 2010,
    $216 million in 2009, and $365 million in 2008. The
    enterprises segment’s operating revenue included in Income
    (Loss) From Discontinued Operations in CMS Energy’s
    Consolidated Financial Statements was $10 million in 2010,
    $7 million in 2009, and $14 million in 2008.


 


    IPP: While owned by CMS Enterprises, CMS Generation
    invested in and operated non-utility power generation plants in
    the U.S. and abroad. In 2007, CMS Enterprises sold CMS
    Generation and all of CMS





    
    23



Table of Contents





    Enterprises’ international assets to third parties and
    transferred its domestic independent power plant operations to
    its subsidiary, HYDRA-CO.


 


    The operating revenue from IPP included in Income From
    Continuing Operations in CMS Energy’s Consolidated
    Financial Statements was $18 million in 2010,
    $18 million in 2009, and $22 million in 2008. The
    operating revenue from IPP included in Income (Loss) From
    Discontinued Operations in CMS Energy’s Consolidated
    Financial Statements was $10 million in 2010,
    $7 million in 2009, and $14 million in 2008.


 


    IPP Properties: At December 31, 2010, CMS
    Energy had ownership interests in independent power plants
    totaling 1,166 gross MW or 1,066 net MW. (Net MW
    reflects that portion of the gross capacity relating to CMS
    Energy’s ownership interests.)

    ownership interest in Exeter to ReEnergy.




 


    Energy Resource Management: CMS ERM purchases and
    sells energy commodities in support of CMS Energy’s
    generating facilities. In 2010, CMS ERM marketed 15 bcf of
    natural gas and 2,308 GWh of electricity. All marketed
    electricity was generated by IPPs of the enterprises segment.
    CMS ERM’s operating revenue included in Income From
    Continuing Operations in CMS Energy’s Consolidated
    Financial Statements was $220 million in 2010,
    $198 million in 2009, and $343 million in 2008.


 


    Natural Gas Transmission: CMS Gas Transmission
    owned, developed, and managed domestic and international natural
    gas facilities. In 2007, CMS Gas Transmission sold a portfolio
    of its businesses in Argentina and its northern Michigan
    non-utility natural gas assets to Lucid Energy, and its
    investment in GasAtacama to Endesa S.A. In 2008, CMS Gas
    Transmission completed the sale of its investment in TGN. CMS
    Gas Transmission’s operating revenue included in Income
    From Continuing Operations in CMS Energy’s Consolidated
    Financial Statements was less than $1 million in each of
    2010, 2009, and 2008.


 


    International Energy Distribution: In 2007, CMS
    Energy exited this line of business when it sold its ownership
    interests in SENECA and CMS Energy Brasil S.A.


 



    OTHER
    BUSINESSES


 


    EnerBank: EnerBank, a wholly owned subsidiary of CMS
    Energy, is a Utah state-chartered, FDIC-insured industrial bank
    providing unsecured consumer installment loans for financing
    home improvements. EnerBank’s operating revenue included in
    Income From Continuing Operations in CMS Energy’s
    Consolidated Financial Statements was $38 million in 2010,
    $26 million in 2009, and $21 million in 2008.

    MPSC


 


    Consumers is subject to the jurisdiction of the MPSC, which
    regulates public utilities in Michigan with respect to retail
    utility rates, accounting, utility services, certain facilities,
    corporate mergers, and other matters.


 


    The Michigan Attorney General, ABATE, the MPSC staff, and
    certain other parties typically participate in MPSC proceedings
    concerning Consumers. The Michigan Attorney General, ABATE, and
    others often appeal significant MPSC orders.


 


    Rate Proceedings: For information regarding open
    rate proceedings, see Item 8. Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,

    Michigan Energy
    Legislation


 


    The 2008 Energy Legislation required that at least ten percent
    of Consumers’ electric sales volume come from renewable
    energy sources by 2015, and included requirements for specific
    capacity additions. The 2008 Energy Legislation also required
    Consumers to prepare an energy optimization plan and achieve
    annual sales reduction targets through at least 2015. The
    targets are incremental with the goal of achieving a six percent
    reduction in customers’ electricity use and a four percent
    reduction in customers’ natural gas use by
    December 31, 2015. For additional information regarding
    Consumers’ renewable energy and energy optimization plans,
    see Item 7. MD&A, Outlook, “Consumers’
    Electric Utility Business Outlook and Uncertainties.”


 


    The 2008 Energy Legislation also reformed the Customer Choice
    Act to limit alternative energy suppliers to supplying no more
    than ten percent of Consumers’ weather-adjusted sales. For
    additional information regarding the Customer Choice Act, see
    Item 7. MD&A, Outlook, “Consumers’ Electric
    Utility Business Outlook and Uncertainties.”


 



    FERC


 


    FERC has exercised limited jurisdiction over several independent
    power plants and exempt wholesale generators in which CMS
    Enterprises has ownership interests, as well as over CMS ERM,
    CMS Gas Transmission, and DIG. Among other things, FERC has
    jurisdiction over acquisitions, operations, and disposals of
    certain assets and facilities, services provided and rates
    charged, conduct among affiliates, and limited jurisdiction over
    holding company matters with respect to CMS Energy. FERC, in
    connection with NERC and with regional reliability
    organizations, also regulates generation owners and operators,
    load serving entities, purchase and sale entities, and others
    with regard to reliability of the bulk power system. Certain
    aspects of Consumers’ gas business are also subject to
    regulation by FERC, including a blanket transportation tariff
    under which Consumers may transport gas in interstate commerce.


 


    FERC also regulates certain aspects of Consumers’ electric
    operations, including compliance with FERC accounting rules,
    wholesale rates, operation of licensed hydroelectric generating
    plants, transfers of certain facilities, corporate mergers, and
    issuances of securities.


 



    Other
    Regulation


 


    The Secretary of Energy regulates imports and exports of natural
    gas and has delegated various aspects of this jurisdiction to
    FERC and the DOE’s Office of Fossil Fuels.


 


    Consumers’ pipelines are subject to the Natural Gas
    Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 and the Pipeline Safety Improvement
    Act of 2002, which regulate the safety of gas pipelines.


 


    EnerBank is regulated by the FDIC.


 



    CMS ENERGY AND
    CONSUMERS ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE


 


    CMS Energy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to
    various federal, state, and local regulations for environmental
    quality, including air and water quality, solid waste
    management, and other matters. For additional





    
    25



Table of Contents





    information concerning environmental matters, see Item 1A.
    Risk Factors and Item 8. Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
    Note 5, Contingencies and Commitments.


 


    CMS Energy has recorded a significant liability for its
    affiliates’ obligations associated with Bay Harbor. For
    additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and
    Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 5, Contingencies
    and Commitments.


 


    Air: Consumers continues to install
    state-of-the-art
    emissions control equipment at its electric generating plants
    and to convert electric generating units to burn cleaner fuels.
    Consumers estimates that it will incur expenditures of
    $1.4 billion from 2011 through 2018 to comply with present
    and future federal and state regulations that will require
    extensive reductions in nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxides,
    particulate matter, and mercury emissions. Consumers’
    estimate may increase if additional laws or regulations are
    adopted or implemented regarding greenhouse gases, including
    carbon dioxide. For additional information concerning estimated
    capital expenditures related to emissions control, see
    Item 7. MD&A, Outlook, “Consumers’ Electric
    Utility Business Outlook and Uncertainties — Electric
    Environmental Estimates.”


 


    Solid Waste Disposal: Costs related to the
    construction, operation, and closure of solid waste disposal
    facilities for coal ash are significant. Historically, Consumers
    has worked with others to reuse 30 to 40 percent of ash produced
    by its coal-fueled plants, and sells ash for use as a Portland
    cement replacement in concrete products, as feedstock for the
    manufacture of Portland cement, and for other
    environmentally-compatible uses. Consumers’ solid waste
    disposal areas are regulated under Michigan’s solid waste
    rules. Consumers has converted all of its fly ash handling
    systems to dry systems, which reduce landfill venting
    substantially. All of Consumers’ ash facilities have
    programs designed to protect the environment and are subject to
    quarterly MDNRE inspections. Furthermore, an independent
    consultant has assessed dike integrity and stability. No major
    deficiencies were identified that could immediately jeopardize
    continued safe and reliable operation of the project structures.
    The draft reports of three EPA contractors who have since
    inspected these facilities with regard to National Dam Safety
    Program Act requirements comport with this conclusion. The EPA
    has proposed new federal regulations for ash disposal areas.
    Consumers estimates that it will incur expenditures of
    $320 million from 2011 through 2018 to comply with future
    regulations relating to ash disposal. For additional information
    concerning estimated capital expenditures related to solid waste
    disposal, see Item 7. MD&A, Outlook,
    “Consumers’ Electric Utility Business Outlook and
    Uncertainties — Electric Environmental Estimates.”


 


    Water: Consumers uses significant amounts of water
    to operate and cool its electric generating plants. Water
    discharge quality is regulated and administered by the MDNRE
    under the federal NPDES program. To comply with such regulation,
    Consumers’ facilities have discharge monitoring programs.
    The EPA is developing new regulations related to cooling water
    intake systems. Consumers estimates that it will incur
    expenditures of $180 million from 2011 through 2018 to
    comply with future regulations relating to cooling water intake
    systems. For additional information concerning estimated capital
    expenditures related to cooling water intake systems, see
    Item 7. MD&A, Outlook, “Consumers’ Electric
    Utility Business Outlook and Uncertainties — Electric
    Environmental Estimates.”


 



    CMS ENERGY AND
    CONSUMERS COMPETITION


 



    Electric
    Competition


 


    Consumers’ electric utility business is subject to actual
    and potential competition from many sources, in both the
    wholesale and retail markets, as well as in electric generation,
    electric delivery, and retail services.


 


    The Customer Choice Act allows all of Consumers’ electric
    customers to buy electric generation service from Consumers or
    from an alternative electric supplier. The 2008 Energy
    Legislation revised the Customer Choice Act by limiting
    alternative electric supply to ten percent of weather-adjusted
    retail sales for the preceding calendar year. At
    December 31, 2010, electric deliveries under the ROA
    program were at the ten percent limit. Alternative electric
    suppliers were providing 807 MW of generation service to
    ROA customers.


 


    Consumers also has competition or potential competition from:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    industrial customers relocating all or a portion of their
    production capacity outside Consumers’ service territory
    for economic reasons;







    
    26



Table of Contents




 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    municipalities owning or operating competing electric delivery
    systems;




 



     
        • 

    
    customer self-generation; and




 



     
        • 

    
    adjacent utilities that extend lines to customers in contiguous
    service territories.





 


    Consumers addresses this competition by monitoring activity in
    adjacent areas and monitoring compliance with the MPSC’s
    and FERC’s rules, providing non-energy services, and
    providing tariff-based incentives that support economic
    development.


 


    CMS ERM continues to focus on optimizing CMS Energy’s IPP
    portfolio. CMS Energy’s IPP business faces competition from
    generators, marketers and brokers, and utilities marketing power
    in the wholesale market.


 



    Gas
    Competition


 


    Competition exists in various aspects of Consumers’ gas
    utility business. Competition comes from other gas suppliers
    taking advantage of direct access to Consumers’ customers
    and from alternative fuels and energy sources, such as propane,
    oil, and electricity.


 



    INSURANCE


 


    CMS Energy and its subsidiaries, including Consumers, maintain
    insurance coverage generally similar to comparable companies in
    the same lines of business. The insurance policies are subject
    to terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions that might not
    fully compensate CMS Energy or Consumers for all losses. A
    portion of each loss is generally assumed by CMS Energy or
    Consumers in the form of deductibles and self-insured retentions
    that, in some cases, are substantial. As CMS Energy or Consumers
    renews its policies, it is possible that some of the present
    insurance coverage may not be renewed or obtainable on
    commercially reasonable terms due to restrictive insurance
    markets.


 


    CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ present insurance program
    does not cover the risks of certain environmental cleanup costs
    and environmental damages, such as claims for air pollution,
    damage to sites owned by CMS Energy or Consumers, and some
    long-term storage or disposal of wastes.

    ITEM 1A. RISK
    FACTORS
    


 


    Actual results in future periods for CMS Energy and Consumers
    could differ materially from historical results and the
    forward-looking statements contained in this report. Factors
    that might cause or contribute to these differences include, but
    are not limited to, those discussed in the following sections.
    CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses are influenced
    by many factors that are difficult to predict, that involve
    uncertainties that may materially affect results, and that are
    often beyond their control. Additional risks and uncertainties
    not presently known or that the companies’ management
    believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect the
    companies. The risk factors described in the following sections,
    as well as the other information included in this report and in
    other documents filed with the SEC, should be considered
    carefully before making an investment in securities of CMS
    Energy or Consumers. Risk factors of Consumers are also risk
    factors of CMS Energy. All of these risk factors are potentially
    significant.


 



    CMS
    Energy depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its
    debt service obligations.


 


    Due to its holding company structure, CMS Energy depends on
    dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and
    other payment obligations. Restrictions contained in
    Consumers’ preferred stock provisions and other legal
    restrictions, such as certain terms in its articles of
    incorporation and FERC requirements, limit Consumers’
    ability to pay dividends or acquire its own stock from CMS
    Energy. At December 31, 2010, Consumers had
    $404 million of unrestricted retained earnings available to
    pay common stock dividends. If sufficient dividends are not paid
    to CMS Energy by its subsidiaries, CMS Energy may not be able to
    generate the funds necessary to fulfill its payment obligations,
    which could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s
    liquidity and financial condition.


 



    CMS
    Energy has indebtedness that could limit its financial
    flexibility and hence its ability to meet its debt service
    obligations.


 


    At December 31, 2010, CMS Energy, including Consumers, had
    $7.2 billion aggregate principal amount of indebtedness,
    including $29 million of subordinated indebtedness relating
    to its convertible preferred securities. CMS Energy had
    $2.3 billion aggregate principal amount of indebtedness at
    December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, there were no
    borrowings and $3 million of letters of credit outstanding
    under CMS Energy’s revolving credit agreement. CMS Energy
    and its subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the
    future.


 


    The level of CMS Energy’s present and future indebtedness
    could have several important effects on its future operations,
    including, among others:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    a significant portion of CMS Energy’s cash flow from
    operations could be dedicated to the payment of principal and
    interest on its indebtedness and would not be available for
    other purposes;




 



     
        • 

    
    covenants contained in CMS Energy’s existing debt
    arrangements, which require it to meet certain financial tests,
    could affect its flexibility in planning for, and reacting to,
    changes in its business;




 



     
        • 

    
    CMS Energy’s ability to obtain additional financing for
    working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and general
    corporate and other purposes could become limited;




 



     
        • 

    
    CMS Energy could be placed at a competitive disadvantage to its
    competitors that are less leveraged;




 



     
        • 

    
    CMS Energy’s vulnerability to adverse economic and industry
    conditions could increase; and




 



     
        • 

    
    CMS Energy’s future credit ratings could fluctuate.





 


    CMS Energy’s ability to meet its debt service obligations
    and to reduce its total indebtedness will depend on its future
    performance, which will be subject to general economic
    conditions, industry cycles, changes in laws or regulatory
    decisions (including with respect to environmental matters), and
    financial, business, and other factors affecting its operations,
    many of which are beyond its control. CMS Energy cannot make
    assurances that its business will continue to generate
    sufficient cash flow from operations to service its
    indebtedness. If CMS Energy is unable to generate sufficient
    cash flows from operations, it may be required to sell assets or
    obtain additional financing. CMS Energy cannot ensure that
    additional financing will be available on commercially
    acceptable terms or at all.

    CMS
    Energy cannot predict the outcome of regulatory reviews and
    claims regarding its participation in the development of Bay
    Harbor.


 


    The EPA and the MDNRE have not completed their review of
    proposals by CMS Land and CMS Capital to remedy the flow of
    leachate from buried CKD piles at the Bay Harbor site to Lake
    Michigan and related environmental issues. One of the major
    issues to be resolved is determining a long-term solution to the
    disposal of leachate collected at the site. In December 2010,
    the MDNRE issued a five-year NPDES permit that authorizes CMS
    Land to discharge treated leachate into Little Traverse Bay.
    Costs to treat and discharge collected leachate under this
    permit could exceed those that are presently anticipated.
    Additionally, CMS Land and CMS Capital could be required to
    alter their present water disposal strategy upon expiration of
    this permit if the MDNRE or EPA identify a more suitable option,
    or if the permit itself is challenged before the MDNRE or the
    courts. CMS Land and CMS Capital, the MDNRE, the EPA, and other
    parties continue to negotiate the long-term remedy for the Bay
    Harbor site. These negotiations are focused on, among other
    things, issues related to:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    the disposal of leachate;




 



     
        • 

    
    the capping and excavation of CKD;




 



     
        • 

    
    the location and design of collection lines and upstream water
    diversion systems;




 



     
        • 

    
    application of criteria for various substances such as
    mercury; and




 



     
        • 

    
    other matters that are likely to affect the scope of remedial
    work that CMS Land and CMS Capital may be obligated to undertake.





 


    Depending on the results of these negotiations, as well as the
    size of any indemnity obligation or liability under an
    Administrative Order on Consent signed by CMS Land and CMS
    Capital or other liability under environmental laws, adverse
    outcomes of some or all of these matters could have a material
    adverse effect on CMS Energy’s liquidity and financial
    condition and could negatively affect CMS Energy’s
    financial results.


 



    CMS
    Energy could be affected adversely by a regulatory investigation
    and civil lawsuits regarding pricing information that CMS MST
    and CMS Field Services provided to market
    publications.


 


    In 2002, CMS Energy notified appropriate regulatory and
    governmental agencies that some employees at CMS MST and CMS
    Field Services appeared to have provided inaccurate information
    regarding natural gas trades to various energy industry
    publications which compile and report index prices. CMS Energy
    is cooperating with an ongoing investigation by the DOJ
    regarding this matter. CMS Energy is unable to predict the
    outcome of the DOJ investigation or the amount of any fines or
    penalties that may be imposed and what effect, if any, the
    investigation will have on CMS Energy.


 


    CMS Energy, CMS MST, CMS Field Services, Cantera Natural Gas,
    Inc., and Cantera Gas Company were named as defendants in
    various lawsuits arising as a result of alleged false natural
    gas price reporting. Allegations included manipulation of NYMEX
    natural gas futures and options prices, price-fixing
    conspiracies, and artificial inflation of natural gas retail
    prices in Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Tennessee, and Wisconsin.
    CMS Energy cannot predict the outcome of the lawsuits or the
    amount of damages for which CMS Energy may be liable. It is
    possible that the outcome in one or more of the lawsuits could
    have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s liquidity,
    financial condition, and results of operations.


 



    CMS
    Energy and Consumers retain contingent liabilities in connection
    with their asset sales.


 


    The agreements that CMS Energy and Consumers enter into for the
    sale of assets customarily include provisions whereby they are
    required to:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    retain specified preexisting liabilities, such as for taxes,
    pensions, or environmental conditions;




 



     
        • 

    
    indemnify the buyers against specified risks, including the
    inaccuracy of representations and warranties they make; and







    
    33



Table of Contents




 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    make payments to the buyers depending on the outcome of
    post-closing adjustments, litigation, audits, or other reviews,
    including claims resulting from attempts by foreign or domestic
    governments to assess taxes on past operations or transactions.





 


    Many of these contingent liabilities can remain open for
    extended periods of time after the sales are closed. Depending
    on the extent to which the buyers may ultimately seek to enforce
    their rights under these contractual provisions, and the
    resolution of any disputes concerning them, there could be a
    material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s or Consumers’
    liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.


 



    CMS
    Energy and Consumers have financing needs and could be unable to
    obtain bank financing or access the capital markets. Potential
    disruption in the capital and credit markets could have a
    material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    businesses, including the availability and cost of short-term
    funds for liquidity requirements and their ability to meet
    long-term commitments. These consequences could have a material
    adverse effect on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    liquidity, financial condition, and results of
    operations.


 


    CMS Energy and Consumers may be subject to liquidity demands
    under commercial commitments, guarantees, indemnities, and
    letters of credit. Consumers’ capital requirements are
    expected to be substantial over the next several years as it
    implements generation and environmental projects, and those
    requirements may increase if additional laws or regulations are
    adopted or implemented regarding greenhouse gases, including
    carbon dioxide.


 


    CMS Energy and Consumers rely on the capital markets,
    particularly for publicly offered debt, as well as on bank
    syndications, to meet their financial commitments and short-term
    liquidity needs if internal funds are not available from CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ respective operations. CMS
    Energy and Consumers also use letters of credit issued under
    certain of their revolving credit facilities to support certain
    operations and investments.


 


    Longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a
    result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced
    alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions
    could adversely affect CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    access to liquidity needed for their respective businesses. Any
    disruption could require CMS Energy and Consumers to take
    measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until
    alternative credit arrangements or other funding for their
    business needs can be arranged. These measures could include
    deferring capital expenditures, changing CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ commodity purchasing strategy to avoid
    collateral-posting requirements, and reducing or eliminating
    future share repurchases, dividend payments, or other
    discretionary uses of cash.


 


    CMS Energy continues to explore financing opportunities to
    supplement its financial plan. These potential opportunities
    include refinancing
    and/or
    issuing new capital markets debt, preferred stock
    and/or
    common equity, and bank financing. Similarly, Consumers plans to
    seek funds through the capital markets, commercial lenders, and
    leasing arrangements. Entering into new financings is subject in
    part to capital market receptivity to utility industry
    securities in general and to CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ securities issuances in particular. CMS Energy
    and Consumers cannot guarantee the capital markets’
    acceptance of their securities or predict the impact of factors
    beyond their control, such as actions of rating agencies. If CMS
    Energy or Consumers is unable to obtain bank financing or access
    the capital markets to incur or refinance indebtedness, or is
    unable to obtain commercially reasonable terms for any
    financing, there could be a material adverse effect on its
    liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.


 


    Certain of CMS Energy’s securities and those of its
    affiliates, including Consumers, are rated by various credit
    rating agencies. Any reduction or withdrawal of one or more of
    its credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on CMS
    Energy’s or Consumers’ ability to access capital on
    acceptable terms and maintain commodity lines of credit, could
    make its cost of borrowing higher, and could cause CMS Energy or
    Consumers to reduce its capital expenditures. If it is unable to
    maintain commodity lines of credit, CMS Energy or Consumers may
    have to post collateral or make prepayments to certain of its
    suppliers under existing contracts. Further, since Consumers
    provides dividends to CMS Energy, any adverse developments
    affecting Consumers that result in a lowering of its credit
    ratings could have an adverse effect on CMS Energy’s credit
    ratings. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot





    
    34



Table of Contents





    guarantee that any of their present ratings will remain in
    effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be
    lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency.


 



    CMS
    Energy and Consumers could incur additional significant costs to
    comply with environmental requirements.


 


    CMS Energy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to
    costly and increasingly stringent environmental regulations.
    They believe that environmental laws and regulations related to
    flue gas emissions, ash disposal, and cooling water use will
    continue to become more stringent and require them to make
    additional significant capital expenditures for emissions
    control equipment installation and upgrades.


 


    In 2009, the EPA issued an endangerment finding for greenhouse
    gases under the Clean Air Act. In this finding, which has been
    challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.
    Circuit by numerous parties, the EPA determined that present and
    projected atmospheric concentrations of six greenhouse gases
    threaten the public health and welfare of present and future
    generations. In May 2010, the EPA issued a final rule that
    addresses greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources under
    the Clean Air Act permitting programs. The “tailoring
    rule” sets thresholds for greenhouse gas emissions that
    define when permits under the NSR and Title V programs are
    required for new and existing industrial facilities. This
    regulation took effect in January 2011. Comprehensive federal
    legislation that addresses greenhouse gases has not advanced in
    the U.S. Congress. Federal legislation is considered likely
    to be enacted in some form in the future and could have a
    significant impact on the operation and cost of existing and
    future fossil-fueled power plants.


 


    In 2010, a significant percentage of the energy generated by
    Consumers came from fossil-fueled power plants. The emissions
    from fossil-fueled power plants would be subject to greenhouse
    gas regulations. CMS Enterprises also has interests in
    fossil-fueled power plants and other types of power plants that
    produce greenhouse gases. Federal laws and rules limiting the
    emission of greenhouse gases or similar state laws and rules, if
    enacted, as well as international accords and treaties, could
    require CMS Energy and Consumers to install additional equipment
    for emission controls, purchase carbon emissions allowances,
    curtail operations, invest in non-fossil-fuel generating
    capacity, or take other significant steps to manage or lower the
    emission of greenhouse gases. The following risks related to
    climate change could also have a material adverse impact on CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ liquidity, financial
    condition, and results of operations:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    litigation originated by third parties against CMS Energy,
    Consumers, or their subsidiaries due to CMS Energy’s or
    Consumers’ greenhouse gas emissions;




 



     
        • 

    
    impairment of CMS Energy’s or Consumers’ reputation
    due to its greenhouse gas emissions and public perception of its
    response to potential greenhouse gas regulations, rules, and
    legislation; and




 



     
        • 

    
    extreme weather conditions, such as severe storms, that may
    affect customer demand, company operations, or assets.





 


    The EPA is considering regulating CCBs, such as coal ash, as
    hazardous wastes under the Resource Conservation and Recovery
    Act. Michigan already regulates CCBs as low-hazard industrial
    waste. If coal ash is regulated as a hazardous waste, Consumers
    would likely cease the beneficial re-use of this product,
    resulting in significantly more coal ash requiring costly
    disposal. Additionally, it is possible that existing landfills
    could be closed if the upgrades to hazardous waste landfill
    standards are economically prohibitive. Costs associated with
    this potential regulation could be substantial.


 


    The EPA is revising regulations that govern cooling water intake
    structures aimed at protecting aquatic life. Costs associated
    with these revisions could be material to CMS Energy, Consumers,
    and CMS Enterprises and result in operational changes or the
    retirement of certain generating units.


 


    CMS Energy and Consumers expect to collect fully from their
    customers, through the ratemaking process, expenditures incurred
    to comply with environmental regulations. If Consumers were
    unable to recover these expenditures from customers in rates, it
    could negatively affect CMS Energy’s
    and/or
    Consumers’ liquidity, results of operations, and financial
    condition and CMS Energy
    and/or
    Consumers could be required to seek significant additional
    financing to fund these expenditures.

    CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses could be affected
    adversely by any delay in meeting environmental
    requirements.


 


    A delay or failure by CMS Energy or Consumers to obtain or
    maintain any necessary environmental permits or approvals to
    satisfy any applicable environmental regulatory requirements or
    install emission control equipment could:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    prevent the construction of new facilities;




 



     
        • 

    
    prevent the continued operation and sale of energy from existing
    facilities;




 



     
        • 

    
    prevent the modification of existing facilities; or




 



     
        • 

    
    result in significant additional costs that could have a
    material adverse effect on their liquidity, financial condition,
    or results of operations.





 



    Market
    performance and other changes could decrease the value of
    benefit plan assets, which then could require significant
    funding.


 


    The performance of the capital markets affects the values of
    assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations
    under CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ pension and
    postretirement benefit plans. CMS Energy and Consumers have
    significant obligations under these plans and hold significant
    assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market
    fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall
    below CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ forecasted return
    rates. A decline in the market value of the assets or a change
    in the level of interest rates used to measure the required
    minimum funding levels may increase the funding requirements of
    these obligations. Also, changes in demographics, including
    increased number of retirements or changes in life expectancy
    assumptions, may increase the funding requirements of the
    obligations related to the pension and postretirement benefit
    plans. If CMS Energy and Consumers were unable to manage their
    pension and postretirement plan assets successfully, it could
    have a material adverse effect on their liquidity, financial
    condition, and results of operations.


 



    Periodic
    reviews of the values of CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    assets could result in accounting charges.


 


    CMS Energy and Consumers are required by GAAP to review
    periodically the carrying value of their assets, including those
    that may be sold. Market conditions, the operational
    characteristics of their assets, and other factors could result
    in recording impairment charges for their assets, which could
    have an adverse effect on their stockholders’ equity and
    their access to additional financing. In addition, CMS Energy
    and Consumers may be required to record impairment charges at
    the time they sell assets, depending on the sale prices they are
    able to secure and other factors.


 



    CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses have safety
    risks.


 


    Consumers’ electric and gas delivery systems, power plants,
    gas infrastructure, and energy products could be involved in
    accidents that result in injury or property loss to customers,
    employees, or the public. Although CMS Energy and Consumers have
    insurance coverage for many potential incidents, depending upon
    the nature or severity of any incident or accident, CMS Energy
    or Consumers could suffer financial loss, damage to its
    reputation, and negative repercussions from regulatory agencies
    or other public authorities.


 



    CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ revenues and results of
    operations are subject to risks that are beyond their control,
    including but not limited to natural disasters, terrorist
    attacks or related acts of war, hostile cyber intrusions, or
    other catastrophic events.


 


    The impact of natural disasters, wars, terrorist acts, cyber
    intrusions, and other catastrophic events on the facilities and
    operations of CMS Energy and Consumers could have a material
    adverse affect on their liquidity, financial condition, and
    results of operations. A terrorist attack on physical
    infrastructure or a major natural disaster could result in
    severe damage to CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ assets
    beyond what could be recovered through insurance policies.
    Hostile cyber intrusions, including those targeting information
    systems as well as electronic control systems used at the
    generating plants and for the electric and gas distribution
    systems, could severely disrupt





    
    36



Table of Contents





    business operations and result in loss of service to customers,
    as well as significant expense to repair security breaches or
    system damage. Terrorist attacks or acts of war could result in
    the disruption of power and fuel markets that could increase
    costs or disrupt service. Instability in the financial markets
    as a result of terrorism, war, natural disasters, credit crises,
    recessions, or other factors, could have a material adverse
    effect on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ liquidity,
    financial condition, and results of operations.


 



    CMS
    Energy and Consumers are exposed to significant reputational
    risks.


 


    Consumers is actively engaged in multiple regulatory oversight
    processes and has a large electric and gas customer base. As a
    result, Consumers has a highly visible public profile in
    Michigan. Consumers and CMS Energy could suffer negative impacts
    to their reputations as a result of operational incidents,
    violations of corporate compliance policies, regulatory
    violations, or other events. This could have a material adverse
    effect on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ liquidity,
    financial condition, and results of operations. It could also
    result in negative customer perception and increased regulatory
    oversight.


 



    Energy
    risk management strategies may not be effective in managing fuel
    and electricity pricing risks, which could result in
    unanticipated liabilities to Consumers and CMS Energy or
    increased volatility of their earnings.


 


    Consumers is exposed to changes in market prices for natural
    gas, coal, electricity, emission allowances, and RECs. Prices
    for natural gas, coal, electricity, emission allowances, and
    RECs may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods
    of time and expose Consumers to commodity price risk. A
    substantial portion of Consumers’ operating expenses for
    its plants consists of the costs of obtaining these commodities.
    Consumers manages these risks using established policies and
    procedures, and it may use various contracts to manage these
    risks, including swaps, options, futures, and forward contracts.
    No assurance can be made that these strategies will be
    successful in managing Consumers’ pricing risk or that they
    will not result in net liabilities to Consumers as a result of
    future volatility in these markets.


 


    Natural gas prices in particular have been historically
    volatile. Consumers routinely enters into contracts to mitigate
    exposure to the risks of demand, market effects of weather, and
    changes in commodity prices associated with its gas distribution
    business. These contracts are executed in conjunction with the
    GCR mechanism, which is designed to allow Consumers to recover
    prudently incurred costs associated with those positions.
    Consumers does not always hedge the entire exposure of its
    operations from commodity price volatility. Furthermore, the
    ability to hedge exposure to commodity price volatility depends
    on liquid commodity markets. As a result, to the extent the
    commodity markets are illiquid, Consumers may not be able to
    execute its risk management strategies, which could result in
    greater unhedged positions than preferred at a given time. To
    the extent that unhedged positions exist, fluctuating commodity
    prices could have a negative effect on CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ liquidity, financial condition, and results of
    operations.


 



    Changes
    in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying
    potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively
    impact CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ results of
    operations.


 


    CMS Energy and Consumers are required to make judgments
    regarding the potential tax effects of various financial
    transactions and results of operations in order to estimate
    their obligations to taxing authorities. The tax obligations
    include income, real estate, sales and use taxes,
    employment-related taxes, and ongoing issues related to these
    tax matters. The judgments include determining reserves for
    potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have
    been taken and may be subject to challenge by the IRS
    and/or other
    taxing authorities. Unfavorable settlements of any of the issues
    related to these reserves at CMS Energy or Consumers could have
    a material adverse effect on its liquidity, financial condition,
    and results of operations.


 


    CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to changing tax laws.
    Increases in local, state, or federal tax rates or other changes
    in tax laws could have adverse impacts on their liquidity,
    financial condition, and results of operations.

    Consumers
    is exposed to risks related to general economic conditions in
    its service territories.


 


    Consumers’ electric and gas utility businesses are affected
    by the economic conditions of the customers they serve. In
    Consumers’ service territories in Michigan, the economy has
    been affected adversely by economic and financial instability in
    the automotive and real estate sectors and by relatively high
    unemployment. The Michigan economy also has been affected
    negatively by the uncertainty in the financial and credit
    markets. If economic conditions in Michigan decline further,
    Consumers may experience reduced demand for electricity or
    natural gas that could result in decreased earnings and cash
    flow. In addition, economic conditions in Consumers’
    service territory affect its collections of accounts receivable
    and levels of lost or stolen gas, which in turn impact its
    liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.


 



    CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ energy sales and operations
    are affected by seasonal factors and varying weather conditions
    from year to year.


 


    CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses are seasonal.
    Demand for electricity is greater in the summer cooling season
    and the winter heating season. Demand for natural gas peaks in
    the winter heating season. Accordingly, their overall results in
    the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. Mild
    temperatures during the summer cooling season and winter heating
    season could have a material adverse affect on CMS Energy’s
    and Consumers’ liquidity, financial condition, and results
    of operations.


 



    Unplanned
    power plant outages could be costly for Consumers.


 


    When unplanned maintenance work is required on power plants or
    other equipment, Consumers may be required to incur unplanned
    expenses and to make spot market purchases of electricity that
    exceed its costs of generation. If Consumers were unable to
    recover any of these increased costs in rates, it could have a
    material adverse effect on Consumers’ liquidity, financial
    condition, and results of operations.


 



    A work
    interruption or other union actions could adversely affect CMS
    Energy and Consumers.


 


    Over 40 percent of CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    employees are represented by a union. If these employees were to
    engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown, or if the
    terms and conditions in future labor agreements were
    renegotiated, CMS Energy and Consumers could experience a
    significant disruption in their operations and higher ongoing
    labor costs.


 



    Failure
    to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could
    harm CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ results of
    operations.


 


    If CMS Energy and Consumers were unable to match skill sets to
    future needs, they could encounter operating challenges and
    increased costs. These challenges could include a lack of
    resources, loss of knowledge, and delays in skill development.
    Additionally, higher costs could result from the use of
    contractors to replace employees, loss of productivity, and
    safety incidents. Failing to train replacement employees
    adequately and to transfer internal knowledge and expertise
    could affect CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ ability to
    manage and operate their businesses. If CMS Energy and Consumers
    were unable to attract and retain an appropriately qualified
    workforce, their results of operations could be affected
    negatively.


 



    Consumers
    may not be able to obtain an adequate supply of coal or natural
    gas, which could limit its ability to operate its electric
    generation facilities or serve its natural gas
    customers.


 


    Consumers is dependent on coal for a significant portion of its
    electric generating capacity. While Consumers has coal supply
    and transportation contracts in place, there can be no assurance
    that the counterparties to these agreements will fulfill their
    obligations to supply coal to Consumers. The suppliers under the
    agreements may experience financial or operational problems that
    inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations to Consumers.
    In addition, suppliers under these agreements may not be
    required to supply coal to Consumers under certain
    circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster. If
    Consumers were unable to obtain its coal requirements under
    existing or future coal supply and transportation contracts, it
    may be required to purchase coal at higher





    
    38



Table of Contents





    prices, or it may be forced to purchase electricity from higher
    cost generating resources in the Midwest Energy Market, which
    would increase Consumers’ working capital requirements.


 


    Consumers has firm interstate transportation and supply
    agreements in place to facilitate deliveries of natural gas to
    its customers. Apart from the contractual and monetary remedies
    available to Consumers in the event of a counterparty’s
    failure to perform, there can be no assurances that the
    counterparties to these firm interstate transportation and
    supply agreements will fulfill their obligations to provide
    natural gas to Consumers. In addition, suppliers under these
    agreements may not be required to deliver natural gas to
    Consumers in certain circumstances, such as in the event of a
    natural disaster. If Consumers were unable to obtain its natural
    gas supply requirements under existing or future natural gas
    supply and transportation contracts, it could be required to
    purchase natural gas at higher prices from other sources or
    implement its natural gas curtailment program filed with the
    MPSC, which would increase Consumers’ working capital
    requirements and decrease its natural gas revenues.


 



    Electric
    industry regulation could have a material adverse effect on CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses.


 


    Federal and state regulation of electric utilities has changed
    dramatically in the last two decades and could continue to
    change over the next several years. These changes could have a
    material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.


 


    CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to, or affected by,
    extensive federal and state utility regulation. In CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ business planning and
    management of operations, they must address the effects of
    existing and proposed regulation on their businesses and changes
    in the regulatory framework, including initiatives by federal
    and state legislatures, regional transmission organizations,
    utility regulators, and taxing authorities. Adoption of new
    regulations by federal or state agencies, or changes to present
    regulations and interpretations of these regulations, could have
    a material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ liquidity, financial condition, and results of
    operations.


 


    There are multiple proceedings pending before FERC involving
    transmission rates, regional transmission organizations, and
    electric bulk power markets and transmission. CMS Energy and
    Consumers cannot predict the impact of these electric industry
    restructuring proceedings on their liquidity, financial
    condition, and results of operations.


 



    Electric
    industry legislation could have a material adverse effect on CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses.


 


    The 2008 Energy Legislation, among other things, limits
    alternative electric supply to ten percent of weather-adjusted
    retail sales for the preceding calendar year for ROA. Proposals
    have been made to raise that limit, which, if enacted, could
    have a material adverse effect on Consumers’ business.
    Proposals also have been made to increase the electric sales
    volume that will be required from renewable energy sources.
    Other new legislation or interpretations could change how the
    businesses of CMS Energy and Consumers operate, impact the
    ability of Consumers to recover costs through rate increases, or
    require CMS Energy or Consumers to incur additional expenses.


 



    The
    markets for alternative energy and distributed generation could
    impact financial results.


 


    Advances in technology could reduce the cost of alternative
    methods of producing electricity, such as fuel cells,
    microturbines, windmills, and photovoltaic (solar) cells, to a
    level that is competitive with that of fossil-fuel technology
    utilized by CMS Energy and Consumers to produce a majority of
    their electricity. It is also possible that electric customers
    could reduce their electric consumption significantly through
    demand-side energy conservation programs. Changes in technology
    could also alter the channels through which electric customers
    buy electricity. Any of these changes could have a material
    adverse effect on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    liquidity, financial condition, or results of operations.




    
    39

    CMS
    Energy and Consumers are subject to rate regulation, which could
    have an adverse effect on financial results.


 


    CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to rate regulation.
    Electric and gas rates for their utilities are set by the MPSC
    and cannot be increased without regulatory authorization. While
    Consumers is permitted by the 2008 Energy Legislation to
    self-implement rate changes six months after a rate filing with
    the MPSC, subject to certain limitations, if a final rate order
    from the MPSC provides for lower rates than Consumers
    self-implemented, Consumers must refund the difference, with
    interest. Also, the MPSC may delay or deny implementation of a
    rate increase upon showing of good cause.


 


    In addition, Consumers’ plans for making significant
    capital investments, including modifications to meet new
    environmental requirements and investment in new generation,
    could be affected adversely or could have a material adverse
    effect on Consumers if rate regulators fail to provide timely
    rate relief. Regulators seeking to avoid or minimize rate
    increases could resist raising customer rates sufficiently to
    permit Consumers to recover the full cost of modifications to
    meet environmental requirements and other prudent investments.
    In addition, because certain costs are mandated by state
    requirements for cost recovery, such as resource additions to
    meet Michigan’s renewable resource standard, regulators
    could be more inclined to oppose rate increases for other
    required items and investments. Rate regulators could also face
    pressure to avoid or limit rate increases for a number of
    reasons, including failure of Michigan’s economy to improve
    or diminishment of Consumers’ customer base. In addition to
    potentially affecting Consumers’ investment program, any
    limitation of cost recovery through rates could have a material
    adverse effect on Consumers’ liquidity, financial
    condition, and results of operations.


 


    A further regulatory risk could arise from the MPSC’s
    adoption of mechanisms to decouple revenues from electricity and
    gas sales. The MPSC’s adoption or future treatment of these
    mechanisms could impact future revenues.


 


    FERC authorizes certain subsidiaries of CMS Energy to sell
    electricity at market-based rates. Failure of CMS Energy and
    Consumers to obtain adequate rates or regulatory approvals in a
    timely manner could have a material adverse effect on CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ liquidity, financial
    condition, and results of operations.


 


    The various risks associated with the MPSC and FERC regulation
    of CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses, which
    include the risk of adverse decisions in any number of rate or
    regulatory proceedings before either agency, could have a
    substantial negative effect on the companies’ investment
    plans and results of operations.


 



    CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ financial statements,
    including their reported earnings, could be significantly
    impacted by convergence with International Financial Reporting
    Standards.


 


    The FASB is expected to make broad changes to GAAP as part of an
    overall initiative to converge U.S. standards with
    International Financial Reporting Standards. These changes could
    have significant impacts on the financial statements of CMS
    Energy and Consumers. Also, the SEC is considering incorporating
    International Financial Reporting Standards into the financial
    reporting system for U.S. registrants. A transition to
    International Financial Reporting Standards could significantly
    impact CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ financial results,
    since these standards differ from GAAP in many ways. One of the
    major differences is the lack of special accounting treatment
    for regulated activities under International Financial Reporting
    Standards, which could result in greater earnings volatility for
    CMS Energy and Consumers.


 



    CMS
    Energy and Consumers are exposed to credit risk of those with
    whom they do business.


 


    CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to credit risk of
    counterparties with whom they do business. Adverse economic
    conditions or financial difficulties experienced by these
    counterparties could impair the ability of these counterparties
    to pay for CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ services or
    fulfill their contractual obligations, including performance and
    payment of damages. CMS Energy and Consumers depend on these
    counterparties to remit payments and perform services timely.
    Any delay or default in payment or performance of contractual
    obligations could have a material adverse effect on CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ liquidity, financial
    condition, and results of operations.

    In recent years, the capital and credit markets have experienced
    unprecedented high levels of volatility and disruption. Market
    disruption and volatility could have a negative impact on CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ lenders, suppliers, customers,
    and other counterparties, causing them to fail to meet their
    obligations. Adverse economic conditions could also have a
    negative impact on the loan portfolio of CMS Energy’s
    banking subsidiary, EnerBank.


 



    CMS
    Energy could be required to pay cash to certain security holders
    in connection with the optional conversion of their convertible
    securities.


 


    CMS Energy has issued two series of cash-convertible securities,
    of which an aggregate principal amount of $460 million was
    outstanding at December 31, 2010. If the trading price of
    CMS Energy’s common stock exceeds specified amounts at the
    end of a particular fiscal quarter, then holders of one or more
    series of these convertible securities will have the option to
    convert their securities in the following fiscal quarter, with
    the principal amount payable in cash by CMS Energy. Accordingly,
    if these trading price minimums are satisfied and security
    holders exercise their conversion rights, CMS Energy may be
    required to outlay a significant amount of cash to those
    security holders, which could have a material adverse effect on
    CMS Energy’s liquidity and financial condition.


 



    There
    are risks associated with Consumers’ significant capital
    investment program planned for the next five
    years.


 


    Consumers’ planned investments include an advanced metering
    infrastructure program, renewable power generation, gas
    compression, environmental controls, other electric and gas
    infrastructure to upgrade delivery systems, and, potentially,
    new power plants. The success of these investments depends on or
    could be affected by a variety of factors including, but not
    limited to, effective cost and schedule management during
    implementation, changes in commodity and other prices,
    operational performance, changes in environmental, legislative
    and regulatory requirements, and regulatory cost recovery.
    Consumers cannot predict the impact that any of these factors
    could have on the success of its capital investment program. It
    is possible that adverse events associated with these factors
    could have a material adverse effect on Consumers’
    liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
