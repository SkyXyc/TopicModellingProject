Item 1.


Business




 

 

Overview

 

 

Transocean Ltd. (together with its subsidiaries and predecessors, unless the context requires otherwise, “Transocean,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a leading international provider of offshore contract drilling services for oil and gas wells.  As of February 20, 2013, we owned or had partial ownership interests in and operated 82 mobile offshore drilling units associated with our continuing operations.  As of this date, the fleet associated with our continuing operations consisted of 48 High-Specification Floaters (Ultra-Deepwater, Deepwater and Harsh Environment semisubmersibles and drillships), 25 Midwater Floaters and nine High-Specification Jackups.  At February 20, 2013, we also had six Ultra-Deepwater drillships and three High-Specification Jackups under construction or under contract to be constructed.

 

 

We specialize in technically demanding regions of the global offshore drilling business with a particular focus on deepwater and harsh environment drilling services.  We believe our mobile offshore drilling fleet is one of the most versatile fleets in the world, consisting of floaters and high-specification jackups used in support of offshore drilling activities and offshore support services on a worldwide basis.  Our primary business is to contract our drilling rigs, related equipment and work crews predominantly on a dayrate basis to drill oil and gas wells.  We also provide oil and gas drilling management services on either a dayrate basis or a completed-project, fixed price or turnkey basis, as well as drilling engineering and drilling project management services.

 

 

Transocean Ltd. is a Swiss corporation with its registered office in Steinhausen, Canton of Zug and with principal executive offices located at Chemin de Blandonnet 10, 1214 Vernier, Switzerland.  Our telephone number at that address is +41 22 930-9000.  Our shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “RIG” and on the SIX Swiss Exchange (“SIX”) under the symbol “RIGN.”  For information about the revenues, operating income, assets and other information related to our business, our segments and the geographic areas in which we operate, see “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 25—Operating Segments, Geographical Analysis and Major Customers.”

 

 

Recent Developments

 

 

In November 2012, in connection with our efforts to improve the overall technical capabilities of our fleet and dispose of non-strategic assets, we completed the sale of 37 Standard Jackups and one swamp barge to Shelf Drilling Holdings, Ltd. (“Shelf Drilling”).  For a transition period following the completion of the sale transactions, we agreed to continue to operate a substantial portion of the Standard Jackups on behalf of Shelf Drilling and to provide certain other transition services to Shelf Drilling.  Under operating agreements, we agreed to continue to operate these Standard Jackups on behalf of Shelf Drilling for periods ranging from nine months to 27 months, until expiration or novation of the underlying drilling contracts by Shelf Drilling.  As of February 20, 2013, we operated 25 Standard Jackups under operating agreements with Shelf Drilling.  In addition, under a transition services agreement, we agreed to provide certain transition services for a period of up to 18 months following the completion of the sale transactions.  See “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 9—Discontinued Operations.”

 

 

In March 2012, we announced our intent to discontinue drilling management services operations in the shallow waters of the United States (“U.S.”) Gulf of Mexico, upon completion of our then-existing contracts.  In December 2012, we completed the final drilling management project and discontinued offering our drilling management services in this region.

Drilling Fleet

 

 

Fleet overview—Most of our drilling equipment is suitable for both exploration and development drilling, and we normally engage in both types of drilling activity.  Likewise, all of our drilling rigs are mobile and can be moved to new locations in response to customer demand.  All of our mobile offshore drilling units are designed for operations away from port for extended periods of time and have living quarters for the crews, a helicopter landing deck and storage space for pipe and drilling supplies.  Our drilling fleet can be generally characterized as follows: (1) floaters, including drillships and semisubmersibles, and (2) jackups.

 

 

Drillships are generally self-propelled vessels, shaped like conventional ships, and are the most mobile of the major rig types.  All of our high-specification drillships are equipped with a computer-controlled dynamic positioning thruster system, which allows them to maintain position without anchors through the use of their onboard propulsion and station-keeping systems.  Drillships typically have greater load capacity than early generation semisubmersible rigs.  This enables them to carry more supplies on board, which often makes them better suited for drilling in remote locations where resupply is more difficult.  However, drillships are generally limited to operations in calmer water conditions than those in which semisubmersibles can operate.  We have three Enterprise-class, five Enhanced Enterprise-class and two other Ultra-Deepwater drillships, which are all equipped with our patented dual-activity technology.  Dual-activity technology employs structures, equipment and techniques using two drilling stations within a single derrick to allow these drillships to perform simultaneous drilling tasks in a parallel rather than sequential manner, reducing critical path activity, to improve efficiency in both exploration and development drilling.  Our Enhanced Enterprise-class drillships offer improved reliability, increased pipe handling capacity, dual well control systems and flexible fluid capabilities and increased water depth and drilling depth.

 

 

Semisubmersibles are floating vessels that can be submerged by means of a water ballast system such that the lower hulls are below the water surface during drilling operations.  These rigs are capable of maintaining their position over a well through the use of an anchoring system or a computer-controlled dynamic positioning thruster system.  Although most semisubmersible rigs are relocated with the assistance of tugs, some units are self-propelled and move between locations under their own power when afloat on pontoons.  Typically, semisubmersibles are better suited than drillships for operations in rougher water conditions.  We have three Express-class semisubmersibles, which are designed for mild environments and are equipped with the unique tri-act derrick.  The tri-act derrick was designed to reduce overall well construction costs, as it allows offline tubular and riser handling operations to occur at two sides of the derrick while the center portion of the derrick is being used for normal drilling operations through the rotary table.  Our three Development Driller-class semisubmersibles and two other semisubmersibles are equipped with our patented dual-activity technology.

 

 

Jackup rigs are mobile self-elevating drilling platforms equipped with legs that can be lowered to the ocean floor until a foundation is established to support the drilling platform.  Once a foundation is established, the drilling platform is then jacked further up the legs so that the platform is above the highest expected waves.  These rigs are generally suited for water depths of 400 feet or less.

 

 

Fleet categories—We further categorize the drilling units of our fleet as follows: (1) “High-Specification Floaters,” consisting of our “Ultra-Deepwater Floaters,” “Deepwater Floaters” and “Harsh Environment Floaters,” (2) “Midwater Floaters” and (3) “High-Specification Jackups”.

 

 

High-Specification Floaters are specialized offshore drilling units that we categorize into three sub-classifications based on their capabilities.  Ultra-Deepwater Floaters are equipped with high-pressure mud pumps and are capable of drilling in water depths of 7,500 feet or greater.  Deepwater Floaters are generally those other semisubmersible rigs and drillships capable of drilling in water depths between 4,500 and 7,500 feet.  Harsh Environment Floaters are capable of drilling in harsh environments in water depths between 1,500 and 10,000 feet and have greater displacement, which offers larger variable load capacity, more useable deck space and better motion characteristics.  Midwater Floaters are generally comprised of those non-high-specification semisubmersibles that have a water depth capacity of less than 4,500 feet.  High-Specification Jackups have greater operational capabilities than Standard Jackups and have higher capacity derricks, drawworks, mud systems and storage.  Typically, High-Specification Jackups also have deeper water depth capacity than Standard Jackups.

 

 

As of February 14, 2013, we owned and operated a fleet of 82 rigs, excluding rigs under construction, was as follows:

 





§  


48 High-Specification Floaters, which are comprised of:




 





§  


27 Ultra-Deepwater Floaters;




 





§  


14 Deepwater Floaters; and




 





§  


Seven Harsh Environment Floaters;




 





§  


25 Midwater Floaters; and




 





§  


Nine High-Specification Jackups.




 

 

As of February 14, 2013, we also operated a fleet of 25 previously owned Standard Jackups, associated with our discontinued operations, under operating agreements with Shelf Drilling, the buyer of these rigs.  We agreed to continue to operate these rigs, for periods ranging from nine months to 27 months, until expiration or novation of the underlying drilling contracts by Shelf Drilling.  See “Part II.  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 9—Discontinued Operations.”

Fleet status—Depending on market conditions, we may idle or stack non-contracted rigs.  An idle rig is between contracts, readily available for operations, and operating costs are typically at or near normal levels.  A stacked rig is staffed by a reduced crew or has no crew and typically has reduced operating costs and is (a) preparing for an extended period of inactivity, (b) expected to continue to be inactive for an extended period, or (c) completing a period of extended inactivity.  Stacked rigs will continue to incur operating costs at or above normal operating levels for 30 to 60 days following initiation of stacking.  Some idle rigs and all stacked rigs require additional costs to return to service.  The actual cost to return to service, which in many instances could be significant and could fluctuate over time, depends upon various factors, including the availability and cost of shipyard facilities, cost of equipment and materials and the extent of repairs and maintenance that may ultimately be required.  We consider these factors, together with market conditions, length of contract, dayrate and other contract terms, when deciding whether to return a stacked rig to service.  We may, from time to time, consider marketing stacked rigs as accommodation units or for other alternative uses until drilling activity increases and we obtain drilling contracts for these units.

 

 

Drilling units—The following tables, presented as of February 14, 2013, provide certain specifications for our rigs.  Unless otherwise noted, the stated location of each rig indicates either the current drilling location, if the rig is operating, or the next operating location, if the rig is in shipyard with a follow-on contract.  As of February 14, 2013, we owned all of the drilling rigs in our fleet noted in the tables below, except for the following: (1) those specifically described as being owned through our interests in joint venture companies and (2) Petrobras 10000, which is subject to a capital lease through August 2029.

Markets

 

 

Our operations are geographically dispersed in oil and gas exploration and development areas throughout the world.  Although the cost of moving a rig and the availability of rig-moving vessels may cause the balance between supply and demand to vary between regions, significant variations do not tend to exist long-term because of rig mobility.  Consequently, we operate in a single, global offshore drilling market.  Because our drilling rigs are mobile assets and are able to be moved according to prevailing market conditions, we cannot predict the percentage of our revenues that will be derived from particular geographic or political areas in future periods.

 

 

As of February 14, 2013, the fleet associated with our continuing operations was located in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (15 units), United Kingdom (“U.K.”) North Sea (12 units), Brazil (10 units), Far East (nine units), Norway (seven units), Nigeria (seven units), India (five units), West African countries other than Nigeria and Angola (five units), Angola (four units), Australia (three units), Canada (two units), Middle East (two units), and Denmark (one unit).

 

 

In recent years, oil companies have placed increased emphasis on exploring for hydrocarbons in deeper waters.  This deepwater focus is due, in part, to technological developments that have made such exploration more feasible and cost-effective.  Therefore, water-depth capability is a key component in determining rig suitability for a particular drilling project.  Another distinguishing feature in some drilling market sectors is a rig’s ability to operate in harsh environments, including extreme marine and climatic conditions and temperatures.

 

 

We categorize the market sectors in which we operate as follows: (1) deepwater, (2) midwater and (3) jackup.  The deepwater and midwater market sectors are serviced by our semisubmersibles and drillships.  Although the term deepwater as used in the drilling industry to denote a particular market sector can vary and continues to evolve with technological improvements, we generally view the deepwater market sector as that which begins in water depths of approximately 4,500 feet and extends to the maximum water depths in which rigs are capable of drilling, which is currently approximately 12,000 feet.  We view the midwater market sector as that which covers water depths of about 300 feet to approximately 4,500 feet.

 

 

The jackup market sector begins at the outer limit of the transition zone, which is characterized by marshes, rivers, lakes and shallow bay and coastal water areas, and extends to water depths of about 400 feet.  This sector has been developed to a significantly greater degree than the deepwater market sector because the shallower water depths have made it much more affordable and accessible than the deeper water market sectors.

Contract Backlog

 

 

At December 31, 2012, the contract backlog associated with our continuing operations was approximately $29.4 billion, representing a 40.7 percent and 24.6 percent increase compared to the contract backlog associated with our continuing operations at December 31, 2011 and 2010, which was $20.9 billion and $23.6 billion, respectively.  See “Part II. Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Outlook—Drilling market” and “Part II. Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Performance and Other Key Indicators.”

 

 

Contract Drilling Services

 

 

Our contracts to provide offshore drilling services are individually negotiated and vary in their terms and provisions.  We obtain most of our contracts through competitive bidding against other contractors.  Drilling contracts generally provide for payment on a dayrate basis, with higher rates while the drilling unit is operating and lower rates or zero rates for periods of mobilization or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns, adverse environmental conditions or other conditions beyond our control.

 

 

A dayrate drilling contract generally extends over a period of time covering either the drilling of a single well or group of wells or covering a stated term.  Certain of our contracts with customers may be cancelable at the option of the customer upon payment of an early termination payment.  Such payments, however, may not fully compensate us for the loss of the contract.  Contracts also customarily provide for either automatic termination or termination at the option of the customer typically without the payment of any termination fee, under various circumstances such as non-performance, in the event of downtime or impaired performance caused by equipment or operational issues, or sustained periods of downtime due to force majeure events.  Many of these events are beyond our control.  The contract term in some instances may be extended by the customer exercising options for the drilling of additional wells or for an additional term.  Our contracts also typically include a provision that allows the customer to extend the contract to finish drilling a well-in-progress.  During periods of depressed market conditions, our customers may seek to renegotiate firm drilling contracts to reduce their obligations or may seek to repudiate their contracts.  Suspension of drilling contracts will result in the reduction in or loss of dayrate for the period of the suspension.  If our customers cancel some of our contracts and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms, or if contracts are suspended for an extended period of time or if a number of our contracts are renegotiated, it could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations or cash flows.  See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks related to our business—Our drilling contracts may be terminated due to a number of events.”

 

 

Consistent with standard industry practice, our customers generally assume, and indemnify us against, well control and subsurface risks under dayrate contracts.  Under all of our current drilling contracts, the operator indemnifies us for pollution damages in connection with reservoir fluids stemming from operations under the contract and we indemnify the operator for pollution from substances in our control that originate from the rig (e.g., diesel used onboard the rig or other fluids stored onboard the rig and above the water surface).  Also, under all of our current drilling contracts, the operator indemnifies us against damage to the well or reservoir and loss of subsurface oil and gas and the cost of bringing the well under control.  However, our drilling contracts are individually negotiated, and the degree of indemnification we receive from the operator against the liabilities discussed above can vary from contract to contract, based on market conditions and customer requirements existing when the contract was negotiated.  In some instances, we have contractually agreed upon certain limits to our indemnification rights and can be responsible for damages up to a specified maximum dollar amount, which amount is usually $5 million or less, although the amount can be greater depending on the nature of our liability.  In most instances in which we are indemnified for damages to the well, we have the responsibility to redrill the well at a reduced dayrate.  Notwithstanding a contractual indemnity from a customer, there can be no assurance that our customers will be financially able to indemnify us or will otherwise honor their contractual indemnity obligations.  See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks related to our business—Our business involves numerous operating hazards.”

 

 

The interpretation and enforceability of a contractual indemnity depends upon the specific facts and circumstances involved, as governed by applicable laws, and may ultimately need to be decided by a court or other proceeding which will need to consider the specific contract language, the facts and applicable laws.  In connection with the Macondo well incident, a court refused to enforce an indemnity in respect of certain penalties and punitive damages under the Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and the enforceability of an indemnity as to other matters may be limited.  The inability or other failure of our customers to fulfill their indemnification obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  Courts also restrict indemnification for criminal fines and penalties.  See “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 17—Commitments and Contingencies—Macondo well incident—Contractual indemnity.”

Drilling Management Services

 

 

We provide drilling management services primarily on a turnkey basis through Applied Drilling Technology Inc., a Texas corporation and our wholly owned subsidiary, which primarily operates in non-U.S. market sectors outside of the North Sea, and through ADT International, a division of one of our U.K. subsidiaries, which primarily operates in the North Sea (together, “ADTI”).  As part of our drilling management services, we provide planning, engineering and management services beyond the scope of our traditional contract drilling business and, thereby, assume greater risk.  Under turnkey arrangements, we typically assume responsibility for the design and execution of a well and deliver a logged or cased hole to an agreed depth for a guaranteed price for which payment is contingent upon successful completion of the well program.

 

 

In addition to turnkey drilling management services, we participate in project management operations that include providing certain planning, management and engineering services, purchasing equipment and providing personnel and other logistical services to customers.  Our project management services differ from turnkey drilling services in that the customer assumes control of the drilling operations and thereby retains the risks associated with the project.

 

 

In March 2012, we announced our intent to discontinue drilling management services operations in the shallow waters of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, a component of our drilling management services segment, upon completion of our then existing contracts.  In December 2012, we completed the final project for our drilling management services operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and discontinued offering our drilling management services in the U.S.

 

 

Revenues from the continuing operations of our drilling management services represented less than three percent of our consolidated revenues from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2012.  In the course of providing drilling management services, ADTI may either use a drilling rig in our fleet or contract for a rig owned by another contract driller.

 

 

Joint Venture, Agency and Sponsorship Relationships and Other Investments

 

 

In some areas of the world, local customs and practice or governmental requirements necessitate the formation of joint ventures with local participation.  We may or may not control these joint ventures.  We are an active participant in several joint venture drilling companies, principally in Angola, Indonesia, Malaysia and Nigeria.  Local laws or customs in some areas of the world also effectively mandate establishment of a relationship with a local agent or sponsor.  When appropriate in these areas, we enter into agency or sponsorship agreements.

 

 

We hold a 65 percent interest in Angola Deepwater Drilling Company Limited (“ADDCL”), a consolidated Cayman Islands joint venture company formed to own Discoverer Luanda.  Our local partner, Angco Cayman Limited, a Cayman Islands company, holds the remaining 35 percent interest in ADDCL.  Beginning January 31, 2016, Angco Cayman Limited will have the right to exchange its interest in the joint venture for cash at an amount based on an appraisal of the fair value of the drillship, subject to certain adjustments.

 

 

We hold a 70 percent interest in Transocean Drilling Services Offshore Inc. (“TDSOI”), a consolidated British Virgin Islands joint venture company formed to own Transocean Honor.  Our local partner, Angco II, a Cayman Islands company, holds the remaining 30 percent interest in TDSOI.  Under certain circumstances, Angco II will have the right to exchange its interest in the joint venture for cash at an amount based on an appraisal of the fair value of the jackup, subject to certain adjustments.

 

 

We hold a 65 percent interest in TSSA – Servicos de Apoio, Lda. (“TSSA”), a consolidated Angola limited liability company formed to operate Discoverer Luanda and Transocean Honor.  Our local partner, Angco Cayman Limited, a Cayman Islands company, holds the remaining 35 percent interest in TSSA.  Under a management services agreement with TSSA, we provide operating management services for Discoverer Luanda and Transocean Honor.

 

 

Significant Customers

 

 

We engage in offshore drilling services for most of the leading international oil companies or their affiliates, as well as for many government-controlled oil companies and independent oil companies.  For the year ended December 31, 2012, our most significant customers were Chevron Corporation, BP America Production Co. (together with its affiliates, “BP”) and Petrobras, accounting for approximately 11 percent, 11 percent and 10 percent, respectively, of our consolidated operating revenues from continuing operations.  No other customers accounted for 10 percent or more of our consolidated operating revenues from continuing operations in the year ended December 31, 2012.  See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks related to our business—We rely heavily on a relatively small number of customers and the loss of a significant customer or a dispute that leads to the loss of a customer could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.”

Employees

 

 

We require highly skilled personnel to operate our drilling units.  Consequently, we conduct extensive personnel recruiting, training and safety programs.  At December 31, 2012, we had approximately 18,400 employees associated with our continuing operations, including approximately 1,700 persons engaged through contract labor providers.  Of our 18,400 employees, approximately 3,000 persons are working under operating agreements with Shelf Drilling and are expected to transition upon expiration of such operating agreements.  Some of our employees working in Angola, the U.K., Nigeria, Norway, Australia and Brazil are represented by, and some of our contracted labor work under, collective bargaining agreements.  Many of these represented individuals are working under agreements that are subject to annual salary negotiation.  These negotiations could result in higher personnel expenses, other increased costs or increased operational restrictions, as the outcome of such negotiations apply to all offshore employees not just the union members.  Additionally, failure to reach agreement on certain key issues may result in strikes, lockouts or other work stoppages that may materially impact our operations.

 

 

Legislation has been introduced in the U.S. Congress that could encourage additional unionization efforts in the U.S., as well as increase the chances that such efforts succeed.  Additional unionization efforts, if successful, new collective bargaining agreements or work stoppages could materially increase our labor costs and operating restrictions.

 

 

Technological Innovation

 

 

We are a leading international provider of offshore contract drilling services and drilling management services for oil and gas wells.  We specialize in technically demanding sectors of the global offshore drilling business.  Our fleet is considered one of the most versatile in the world with a particular focus on deepwater and harsh environment drilling capabilities.  Since launching the offshore industry’s first jackup drilling rig in 1954, we have achieved a long history of technological innovations, including the first dynamically positioned drillship, the first rig to drill year-round in the North Sea, the first semisubmersible rig for year-round Sub-Arctic operations, and the latest generations of ultra-deepwater drillships and semisubmersibles.  Fifteen rigs in our existing fleet, and six of our rigs that are currently under construction, are equipped with our patented dual-activity technology, which allows our rigs to perform simultaneous drilling tasks in a parallel rather than sequential manner and reduces critical path activity while improving efficiency in both exploration and development drilling.  Additionally, three rigs in our existing fleet are equipped with the unique tri-act derrick, which allows offline tubular and riser activities during normal drilling operations and is patented in certain market sectors in which we operate.  In 2011, we acquired two custom designed, semisubmersible drilling rigs, equipped for year-round operations in harsh environments, including those of the Norwegian continental shelf and sub-Arctic waters.  We have three jackup drilling rigs currently under construction that are expected to be capable of constructing wells up to 35,000 feet deep and feature advanced offshore drilling technology, including offline tubular handling features and simultaneous operations support.  In 2012, we entered into shipyard contracts for the construction of four newbuild dynamically positioned Ultra-Deepwater drillships that will be equipped with dual activity, industry-leading hoisting capacity, a second blowout preventer system and will be outfitted to accommodate a future upgrade to a 20,000 psi blowout preventer.  We continue to seek to develop industry-leading technology, including managed pressure drilling solutions, emission monitoring, hybrid power systems, and advanced generator protection.  The effective use of and continued improvements in technology are critical to maintaining our competitive position within the drilling services industry.  We expect to continue to develop technology internally or to acquire technology through strategic acquisitions.

 

 

Environmental Regulation

 

 

Our operations are subject to a variety of global environmental regulations.  We monitor environmental regulation in each country of operation and, while we see an increase in general environmental regulation, we have made and will continue to make the required expenditures to comply with current and future environmental requirements.  We make expenditures to further our commitment to environmental improvement and the setting of a global environmental standard as part of our wider corporate responsibility effort.  We assess the environmental impacts of our business, specifically in the areas of greenhouse gas emissions, climate change, discharges and waste management.  Our actions are designed to reduce risk in our current and future operations, to promote sound environmental management and to create a proactive environmental program.  To date, we have not incurred material costs in order to comply with recent legislation, and we do not believe that our compliance with such requirements will have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, consolidated results of operations or cash flows.

 

 

For a discussion of the effects of environmental regulation, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks related to our business—Compliance with or breach of environmental laws can be costly and could limit our operations.”

Item 1A.                 Risk Factors

 

 

Risks related to our business

 

 

The Macondo well incident could result in increased expenses and decreased revenues, which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on us.

 

 

Numerous lawsuits have been filed against us and unaffiliated defendants related to the Macondo well incident.  We are subject to claims alleging that we are jointly and severally liable, along with BP and others, for damages arising from the Macondo well incident.  We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant legal fees and costs in responding to these matters.  In January 2013, we agreed with the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) to pay $1.4 billion in fines, recoveries and penalties, excluding interest, over a five-year period through 2017, and we may be subject to additional governmental fines or penalties.  These payments will not be deductible for tax purposes, and the criminal fines will not be covered in full by insurance.  Although we have excess liability insurance coverage relating to certain other liabilities associated with the Macondo well incident, our personal injury and other third-party liability insurance coverage is subject to deductibles and overall aggregate policy limits and does not cover criminal fines and penalties.  There can be no assurance that our insurance will ultimately be adequate to cover all of our remaining potential liabilities in connection with these matters.  For a discussion of the potential impact of the failure of the Macondo well operator to honor its indemnification obligations to us, see “We could experience a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations and cash flows to the extent any of the Macondo well operator’s indemnification obligations to us are not enforceable or the operator does not indemnify us” below.  If we ultimately incur substantial liabilities in connection with these matters with respect to which we are neither insured nor indemnified, those liabilities could have a material adverse effect on us.

 

 

The incident has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  In the three years ended December 31, 2012, we estimate that the Macondo well incident had a direct and indirect effect of greater than $1.0 billion in lost revenues and incremental costs and expenses associated with extended shipyard projects and increased downtime, both as a result of complying with the enhanced regulations and our customers’ requirements.  We also lost approximately $1.1 billion of contract backlog associated with the termination of the Deepwater Horizon contract in April 2010 resulting from the loss of the rig and the termination of another drilling contract in December 2011 resulting from the previously mentioned increased downtime.  Through December 31, 2012, we have recognized estimated losses of $1.9 billion in connection with loss contingencies associated with the Macondo well incident that we believe are probable and for which a reasonable estimate can be made.  Additionally, in the three years ended December 31, 2012, we incurred cumulative incremental costs, primarily associated with legal expenses for lawsuits and investigations, in the amount of $372 million.  Collectively, the lost contract backlog from the incident and from the termination in December 2011, the lost revenues and incremental costs and expenses and other losses have had an effect of greater than $4.0 billion.

 

 

We are currently unable to estimate the full impact the Macondo well incident will have on us.  We have recognized a liability for estimated loss contingencies that we believe are probable and for which a reasonable estimate can be made.  We have recognized a liability for such loss contingencies in the amount of $1.9 billion.  This liability takes into account certain events related to the litigation and investigations arising out of the incident.  There are loss contingencies related to the Macondo well incident that we believe are reasonably possible and for which we do not believe a reasonable estimate can be made.  These contingencies could increase the liabilities we ultimately recognize.  Our estimates involve a significant amount of judgment.  As a result of new information or future developments, we may adjust our estimated loss contingencies arising out of the Macondo well incident, and the resulting liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

 

 

Our business may also be adversely impacted by any negative publicity relating to the incident and us, any negative perceptions about us by customers, the skilled personnel that we require to support our operations or others, any further increases in premiums for insurance or difficulty in obtaining coverage and the diversion of management’s attention from our other operations to focus on matters relating to the incident.  In addition, the Macondo well incident could negatively impact our ongoing business relationship with BP, which accounted for approximately 11 percent of our consolidated operating revenues from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2012.  Ultimately, these factors could have a material adverse effect on our statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

We could experience a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations and cash flows to the extent any of the Macondo well operator’s indemnification obligations to us are not enforceable or the operator does not indemnify us.

 

 

The combined response team to the Macondo well incident was unable to stem the flow of hydrocarbons from the well prior to the sinking of Deepwater Horizon.  The resulting spill of hydrocarbons was the most extensive in U.S. history.  According to its public filings, the operator has recognized cumulative pre-tax losses of $42.2 billion in relation to the spill as of February 5, 2013.  As described under “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 17—Commitments and Contingencies—Macondo well incident—Contractual indemnity,” under the Deepwater Horizon drilling contract, BP agreed to indemnify us with respect to certain matters, and we agreed to indemnify BP with respect to certain matters.  We could ultimately experience a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations and cash flows to the extent that BP does not honor its indemnification obligations, including by reason of financial or legal restrictions, or our insurance policies do not fully cover these amounts.  In April 2011, BP filed a claim seeking a declaration that it is not liable to us in contribution, indemnification, or otherwise, and further, BP has brought claims against us seeking indemnification and contribution.  On November 1, 2011, we filed a motion for partial summary judgment regarding the scope and enforceability of the indemnity obligations in the drilling contract.  On January 26, 2012, the court ruled that the drilling contract requires BP to indemnify us for compensatory damages asserted by third parties against us related to pollution that did not originate on or above the surface of the water, even if the claim is the result of our strict liability, negligence or gross negligence.  The court also held that BP does not owe us indemnity to the extent that we are held liable for punitive damages or civil penalties under the CWA.  The court deferred ruling on BP’s argument that we breached the drilling contract or materially increased BP’s risk or prejudiced its rights so as to impair BP’s indemnity obligations.  The law generally considers contractual indemnity for criminal fines and penalties to be against public policy.

 

 

In addition, in connection with our settlement with the DOJ, we agreed that we will not use payments pursuant to a civil consent decree by and among the DOJ and certain of our affiliates (the “Consent Decree”) as a basis for indemnity or reimbursement from non-insurer defendants named in the complaint by the U.S. or their affiliates.

 

 

Despite our settlement with the DOJ, we could have additional liabilities to the U.S. government and others.  The ultimate outcome of investigations of the Macondo well incident, DOJ lawsuits and our settlement with the DOJ is uncertain.

 

 

On December 15, 2010, the DOJ filed a civil lawsuit against us and other unaffiliated defendants.  The complaint alleged claims under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) and the CWA, including claims for per barrel civil penalties.  The complaint asserted that all defendants are jointly and severally liable for all removal costs and damages resulting from the Macondo well incident.  On December 6, 2011, the DOJ filed a motion for partial summary judgment seeking a ruling that we were jointly and severally liable under OPA, and liable for civil penalties under the CWA, for all discharges from the Macondo well on the theory that the discharges not only came from the well, but also came from the blowout preventer and riser, appurtenances of Deepwater Horizon.  On February 22, 2012, the U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana ruled that we are not liable as a responsible party for damages under OPA with respect to the below surface discharges from the Macondo well.  The court also ruled that the below surface discharge was discharged from the well facility, and not from the Deepwater Horizon vessel, within the meaning of the CWA, and that we therefore are not liable for such discharges as an owner of the vessel under the CWA.  This ruling is currently being appealed to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.  In addition, the court ruled that the issue of whether we could be held liable for such discharge under the CWA as an “operator” of the well facility could not be resolved on summary judgment.  The court did not determine whether we could be liable for removal costs under OPA, or the extent of such removal costs.

 

 

The DOJ also conducted a criminal investigation into the Macondo well incident.  On March 7, 2011, the DOJ announced the formation of a task force to investigate possible violations by us and certain unaffiliated parties of the CWA, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Refuse Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the Seaman’s Manslaughter Act, among other federal statutes, and possible criminal liabilities, including fines under those statutes and under the Alternative Fines Act.  On January 3, 2013, we reached an agreement with the DOJ to resolve certain outstanding civil and potential criminal charges against us arising from the Macondo well incident through a cooperation guilty plea agreement by and among the DOJ and certain of our affiliates (the “Plea Agreement”) and the Consent Decree.  As part of this resolution, we agreed to pay $1.4 billion in fines, recoveries and civil penalties, excluding interest, in scheduled payments over a five-year period through 2017, which will decrease our available liquidity capacity.  Our settlement with the DOJ does not release us from liabilities to the U.S. government as to all Macondo-related matters nor does it release all Transocean-related persons and entities.  In particular, this agreement is without prejudice to the rights of the U.S. with respect to all other matters, including certain liabilities under the OPA for removal costs or for damages, damages for injury to, loss of or loss of use of natural resources, including the reasonable cost of assessing the damage, certain claims for a declaratory judgment of liability under OPA already claimed by the U.S., and certain liabilities for response costs and damages, including injury to park system resources, damages for injury to or loss of natural resources and for the cost of any natural resource damage assessments.  Both our criminal Plea Agreement and our civil Consent Decree have received final court approval.  We will incur costs, expenses and be required to devote management and other corporate resources to comply with our agreements with the U.S.  Under these agreements, we will be subject to restrictions and obligations not imposed on other drilling contractors, which may adversely impact us.

See “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 17—Commitments and Contingencies—Macondo well incident—Litigation.”

 

 

Pursuant to our Plea Agreement, we will be subject to five years’ probation.  Pursuant to the terms of our civil Consent Decree, we will be subject to the restrictions of that decree for an extended period of time that will be at least five years.  Any failure to comply with the Consent Decree or probation could result in additional penalties, sanctions and costs and could adversely affect us.  See “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 17—Commitments and Contingencies—Macondo well incident—Litigation.”

 

 

In addition, a number of other governmental and regulatory bodies as well as we and other companies have conducted investigations into the Macondo well incident.  Many of these investigations have resulted in reports that are critical of us and our actions leading up to and in connection with the incident.

We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the remaining DOJ or other governmental claims or any of the investigations, including any impact on the litigation related to the Macondo well incident, the extent to which we could be subject to fines, sanctions or other penalties or the potential impact of implementing measures resulting from the settlement with the DOJ, our guilty plea or arising from the investigations or the costs to be incurred in completing the investigations.

 

 

The continuing effects of the enhanced regulations enacted following the Macondo well incident could materially and adversely affect our worldwide operations.

 

 

New governmental safety and environmental requirements applicable to both deepwater and shallow water operations have been adopted for drilling in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico following the Macondo well incident.  In order to obtain drilling permits, operators must submit applications that demonstrate compliance with the enhanced regulations, which require independent third-party inspections, certification of well design and well control equipment and emergency response plans in the event of a blowout, among other requirements.  Operators have, and may continue to have, difficulties obtaining drilling permits in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.  In addition, the oil and gas industry has adopted new equipment and operating standards such as the American Petroleum Institute standard 53 relating to the installation and testing of well control equipment.  These new safety and environmental guidelines and standards and any further new guidelines or standards the U.S. government or industry may issue or any other steps the U.S. government or industry may take, could disrupt or delay operations, increase the cost of operations, increase out-of-service time or reduce the area of operations for drilling rigs in U.S. and non-U.S. offshore areas.

 

 

Other governments could take similar actions relating to implementing new safety and environmental regulations in the future.  Additionally, some of our customers have elected to voluntarily comply with some or all of the new inspections, certification requirements and safety and environmental guidelines on rigs operating outside of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.  Additional governmental regulations and requirements concerning licensing, taxation, equipment specifications and training requirements or the voluntary adoption of such requirements or guidelines by our customers could increase the costs of our operations, increase certification and permitting requirements, increase review periods and impose increased liability on offshore operations.  The requirements applicable to us under the Consent Decree with the DOJ cover safety, environmental, reporting, operational and other matters and are in addition to the regulations applicable to all industry participants and may add additional costs and liabilities.

 

 

The continuing effects of the enhanced regulations may also decrease the demand for drilling services, negatively affect dayrates and increase out-of-service time, which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability.  We are unable to predict the full impact that the continuing effects of the enhanced regulations will have on our operations.

The Frade Field incident in Brazil could result in increased expenses and decreased revenues, which could ultimately have a material impact on us.

 

 

On or about November 7, 2011, oil was released from fissures in the ocean floor in the vicinity of a development well being drilled by Chevron off the coast of Rio de Janeiro in the Campo de Frade field with our Deepwater Floater Sedco 706.  In connection with the incident, authorities in Brazil have filed a civil action against Chevron and us.  We may be subject to liability for civil damage and governmental fines or penalties.  If we ultimately incur substantial liabilities in connection with these matters for which we are neither insured nor indemnified, those liabilities could adversely affect our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flow.  In addition, a prosecutor in the town of Campos in Rio de Janeiro State sought an injunction to prevent Chevron and us from conducting extraction or transportation activities in Brazil and to seek to require Chevron to stop the release and remediate its effects.  In July 2012, the appellate court granted the requested for preliminary injunction.  On September 22, 2012, the federal court in Rio de Janeiro served us with the preliminary injunction.  The terms of this injunction required us to cease conducting extraction or transportation activities in Brazil within 30 days from the date of service.  On September 28, 2012, the Brazilian Superior Court of Justice partially suspended this preliminary injunction.  As a result of this suspension, the preliminary injunction only applied to our operations in the Campo de Frade field, and we could continue to operate in all other offshore oil and gas fields in Brazil.  On November 27, 2012, the Court of Appeals in Rio de Janeiro ruled unanimously to suspend the entire preliminary injunction order, including the injunction in the Campo de Frade field that had been entered in July 2012.  This ruling was published on December 5, 2012.  The lawsuit will continue in the trial court, and there remains a risk that the preliminary injunction could be reinstated, or that at the conclusion of the case Brazilian authorities could permanently enjoin us from further operations in Brazil.  For the year ended December 31, 2012, our operations in Brazil accounted for 12 percent of our consolidated operating revenues.  If we are enjoined from operating in Brazil for a substantial period of time, the resulting decrease in demand for our drilling services could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

 

 

Our business depends on the level of activity in the offshore oil and gas industry, which is significantly affected by volatile oil and gas prices and other factors.

 

 

Our business depends on the level of activity in oil and gas exploration, development and production in offshore areas worldwide.  Demand for our services depends on oil and natural gas industry activity and expenditure levels that are directly affected by trends in oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas prices.

 

 

Oil and gas prices are extremely volatile and are affected by numerous factors, including the following:

 





§  


worldwide demand for oil and gas, including economic activity in the U.S. and other large energy-consuming markets;




 





§  


the ability of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) to set and maintain production levels, productive spare capacity and pricing;




 





§  


the level of production in non-OPEC countries;




 





§  


the policies of various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and gas reserves;




 





§  


advances in exploration and development technology;




 





§  


the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves;




 





§  


the rate of decline of existing oil and gas reserves;




 





§  


laws and regulations related to environmental matters, including those addressing alternative energy sources and the risks of global climate change;




 





§  


the development and exploitation of alternative fuels;




 





§  


the development of new technology to exploit oil and gas reserves, such as shale oil;




 





§  


adverse weather conditions; and




 





§  


the worldwide military and political environment, including uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or outbreak of armed hostilities, civil unrest or other crises in the Middle East or other geographic areas or acts of terrorism.




 

 

Demand for our services is particularly sensitive to the level of exploration, development and production activity of, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil and natural gas companies, including national oil companies.  Any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices could depress the immediate levels of exploration, development and production activity.  Perceptions of longer-term lower oil and natural gas prices by oil and gas companies could similarly reduce or defer major expenditures given the long-term nature of many large-scale development projects.  Lower levels of activity result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability.  Oil and gas prices and market expectations of potential changes in these prices significantly affect this level of activity.  However, higher near-term commodity prices do not necessarily translate into increased drilling activity since customers’ expectations of longer-term future commodity prices typically drive demand for our rigs.  Also, increased competition for customers’ drilling budgets could come from, among other areas, land-based energy markets in Africa, Russia, China, Western Asian countries, the Middle East, the U.S. and elsewhere.  The availability of quality drilling prospects, exploration success, relative production costs, the stage of reservoir development and political and regulatory environments also affect customers’ drilling campaigns.  Worldwide military, political and economic events have contributed to oil and gas price volatility and are likely to do so in the future.

Our industry is highly competitive and cyclical, with intense price competition.

 

 

The offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive with numerous industry participants, none of which has a dominant market share.  Drilling contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis.  Intense price competition is often the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job, although rig availability and the quality and technical capability of service and equipment are also considered.

 

 

Our industry has historically been cyclical and is impacted by oil and gas price levels and volatility.  There have been periods of high demand, short rig supply and high dayrates, followed by periods of low demand, excess rig supply and low dayrates.  Changes in commodity prices can have a dramatic effect on rig demand, and periods of excess rig supply intensify the competition in the industry and often result in rigs being idle for long periods of time.  We have idled and stacked rigs, and may in the future idle or stack additional rigs or enter into lower dayrate contracts in response to market conditions.  We cannot predict when any idled or stacked rigs will return to service.

 

 

During prior periods of high dayrates and rig utilization rates, industry participants have increased the supply of rigs by ordering the construction of new units.  This has historically resulted in an oversupply of rigs and has caused a subsequent decline in dayrates and rig utilization rates, sometimes for extended periods of time.  Presently, there are numerous recently constructed high-specification floaters and jackups that have entered the market, and there are more that are under contract for construction.  The entry into service of these new units has increased and will continue to increase supply and could curtail a strengthening, or trigger a reduction, in dayrates as rigs are absorbed into the active fleet or lead to accelerated stacking of the existing fleet.  A significant number of the newbuild units have not been contracted for work, which may intensify price competition.  Any further increase in construction of new units would likely exacerbate the negative impact on dayrates and utilization rates.  Lower dayrates and rig utilization rates could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.

 

 

We have a substantial amount of debt, and we may lose the ability to obtain future financing and suffer competitive disadvantages.

 

 

Our overall debt level was approximately $12.5 billion and $13.5 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  This substantial level of debt and other obligations could have significant adverse consequences on our business and future prospects, including the following:

 





§  


we may not be able to obtain financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, distributions, share repurchases, or other purposes;




 





§  


we may not be able to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to service the debt;




 





§  


we could become more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including increases in interest rates, particularly given our substantial indebtedness, some of which bears interest at variable rates;




 





§  


we may not be able to meet financial ratios or satisfy certain other conditions included in our bank credit agreements, which could result in our inability to meet requirements for borrowings under our bank credit agreements or a default under these agreements and trigger cross default provisions in our other debt instruments; and




 





§  


we may be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities and to react to changes in market or industry conditions than our less levered competitors.




 

 

Credit rating agencies may lower our corporate credit ratings below investment grade.

 

 

Credit rating agencies may downgrade our credit ratings to non-investment grade levels.  Such ratings levels could have material adverse consequences on our business and future prospects, including the following:

 





§  


limit our ability to access debt markets, including for the purpose of refinancing our existing debt;




 





§  


cause us to refinance or issue debt with less favorable terms and conditions, which debt may require collateral and restrict, among other things, our ability to pay distributions or repurchase shares;




 





§  


increase certain fees under our credit facilities and interest rates under agreements governing certain of our senior notes;




 





§  


cause additional indebtedness of approximately $30 million to become due;




 





§  


negatively impact current and prospective customers’ willingness to transact business with us;




 





§  


impose additional insurance, guarantee and collateral requirements;




 





§  


limit our access to bank and third-party guarantees, surety bonds and letters of credit; and




 





§  


suppliers and financial institutions may lower or eliminate the level of credit provided through payment terms or intraday funding when dealing with us thereby increasing the need for higher levels of cash on hand, which would decrease our ability to repay debt balances.




 

 

 Since the Macondo well incident, Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch have each downgraded their ratings of our senior unsecured debt on more than one occasion.  Any further downgrade by any of the rating agencies could have the effects described above.  We cannot provide assurance that our credit ratings will not be downgraded to a non-investment grade rating in the near future.  See “The Macondo well incident could result in increased expenses and decreased revenues, which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on us.”

We rely heavily on a relatively small number of customers and the loss of a significant customer or a dispute that leads to the loss of a customer could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.

 

 

We engage in offshore drilling services for most of the leading international oil companies or their affiliates, as well as for many government-controlled oil companies and independent oil companies.  For the year ended December 31, 2012, our most significant customers were Chevron, BP and Petrobras, accounting for approximately 11 percent, 11 percent and 10 percent, respectively, of our consolidated operating revenues from continuing operations.  As of February 14, 2013, the aggregate amount of contract backlog associated with our contracts with Chevron, BP and Petrobras was $6.8 billion.  Additionally, in the year ended December 31, 2012, we entered into 10-year drilling contracts with Royal Dutch Shell plc (“Royal Dutch Shell”) for four newbuild Ultra-Deepwater drillships.  As of February 14, 2013, the aggregate amount of contract backlog associated with Royal Dutch Shell was $8.8 billion.  Our relationship with BP, whose affiliate was the operator of the Macondo well, has been and could continue to be negatively impacted by the Macondo well incident.  The loss of any of these customers or another significant customer could, at least in the short term, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.

 

 

Significant part or equipment shortages, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions, supplier quality and sourcing issues or price increases could increase our operating costs, decrease our revenues and adversely impact our operations.

 

 

Our reliance on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to secure equipment, parts, components and sub-systems used in our operations exposes us to volatility in the quality, prices and availability of such items.  Certain high specification parts and equipment we use in our operations may be available only from a small number of suppliers, manufacturers or service providers, or in some cases must be sourced through a single supplier, manufacturer or service provider.  A disruption in the deliveries from such third-party suppliers, manufacturers or service providers, capacity constraints, production disruptions, price increases, quality control issues, recalls or other decreased availability of parts and equipment could adversely affect our ability to meet our commitments to customers, adversely impact our operations and revenues or increase our operating costs.

 

 

Our operating and maintenance costs will not necessarily fluctuate in proportion to changes in operating revenues.

 

 

Our operating and maintenance costs will not necessarily fluctuate in proportion to changes in operating revenues.  Costs for operating a rig are generally fixed or only semi-variable regardless of the dayrate being earned.  In addition, should our rigs incur unplanned downtime while on contract or idle time between contracts, we typically will not reduce the staff on those rigs because we will use the crew to prepare the rig for its next contract.  During times of reduced activity, reductions in costs may not be immediate as portions of the crew may be required to prepare rigs for stacking, after which time the crew members are assigned to active rigs or dismissed.  As our rigs are mobilized from one geographic location to another, the labor and other operating and maintenance costs can vary significantly.  In general, labor costs increase primarily due to higher salary levels and inflation.  Equipment maintenance expenses fluctuate depending upon the type of activity the unit is performing and the age and condition of the equipment, and these expenses could increase for short or extended periods as a result of regulatory or customer requirements that raise maintenance standards above historical levels.  Contract preparation expenses vary based on the scope and length of contract preparation required and the duration of the firm contractual period over which such expenditures are amortized.

 

 

Our shipyard projects and operations are subject to delays and cost overruns.

 

 

As of February 20, 2013, we had six Ultra-Deepwater Floater and three High-Specification Jackup newbuild rig projects.  We also have a variety of other more limited shipyard projects at any given time.  These shipyard projects are subject to the risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any such construction project resulting from numerous factors, including the following:

 





§  


availability of suppliers to recertify equipment for enhanced regulations;




 





§  


shipyard availability, failures and difficulties;




 





§  


shortages of equipment, materials or skilled labor;




 





§  


unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment;




 





§  


design and engineering problems, including those relating to the commissioning of newly designed equipment;




 





§  


latent damages or deterioration to hull, equipment and machinery in excess of engineering estimates and assumptions;




 





§  


unanticipated actual or purported change orders;




 





§  


disputes with shipyards and suppliers;




 





§  


failure or delay of third-party vendors or service providers;




 





§  


strikes, labor disputes and work stoppages;




 





§  


customer acceptance delays;




 





§  


adverse weather conditions, including damage caused by such conditions;




 





§  


terrorist acts, war, piracy and civil unrest;




 





§  


unanticipated cost increases; and




 





§  


difficulty in obtaining necessary permits or approvals.




 

 

These factors may contribute to cost variations and delays in the delivery of our newbuild units and other rigs undergoing shipyard projects.  Delays in the delivery of these units would result in delay in contract commencement, resulting in a loss of revenue to us, and may also cause customers to terminate or shorten the term of the drilling contract for the rig pursuant to applicable late delivery clauses.  In the event of termination of one of these contracts, we may not be able to secure a replacement contract on as favorable terms, if at all.

 

 

Our operations also rely on a significant supply of capital and consumable spare parts and equipment to maintain and repair our fleet.  We also rely on the supply of ancillary services, including supply boats and helicopters.  Shortages in materials, delays in the delivery of necessary spare parts, equipment or other materials, or the unavailability of ancillary services could negatively impact our future operations and result in increases in rig downtime and delays in the repair and maintenance of our fleet.

Compliance with or breach of environmental laws can be costly and could limit our operations.

 

 

Our operations are subject to regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment, requiring removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment.  For example, as an operator of mobile offshore drilling units in some offshore areas, we may be liable for damages and costs incurred in connection with oil spills or waste disposals related to those operations.  Laws and regulations protecting the environment have become more stringent in recent years, and may in some cases impose strict liability, rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence.  These laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed.  The application of these requirements or the adoption of new requirements could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  In addition, our Consent Decree and probation arising out of our guilty plea agreement with the DOJ add to these regulations, requirements and liabilities.  Numerous lawsuits, including one brought by the DOJ, allege that we may have liability under the environmental laws relating to the Macondo well incident.  Our guilty plea to negligently discharging oil into the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in connection with the Macondo well incident caused us to incur such liabilities.  We may be subject to additional liabilities and penalties.  See “The Macondo well incident could result in increased expenses and decreased revenues, which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on us.”

 

 

There is no assurance that we can obtain enforceable indemnities against liability for pollution, well and environmental damages in all of our contracts or that, in the event of extensive pollution and environmental damages, our customers or other third parties will have the financial capability to fulfill their indemnity obligations to us.  A court in the litigation related to the Macondo well incident has refused to enforce all aspects of our indemnity with respect to certain environmental-related liabilities.

 

 

Our drilling contracts may be terminated due to a number of events.

 

 

Certain of our contracts with customers may be cancelable at the option of the customer upon payment of an early termination payment.  Such payments may not, however, fully compensate us for the loss of the contract.  Contracts also customarily provide for either automatic termination or termination at the option of the customer typically without the payment of any termination fee, under various circumstances such as non-performance, as a result of significant downtime or impaired performance caused by equipment or operational issues, or sustained periods of downtime due to force majeure events.  Many of these events are beyond our control.  During periods of depressed market conditions, we are subject to an increased risk of our customers seeking to repudiate their contracts, including through claims of non-performance.  Our customers’ ability to perform their obligations under their drilling contracts, including their ability to fulfill their indemnity obligations to us, may also be negatively impacted by an economic downturn.  Our customers, which include national oil companies, often have significant bargaining leverage over us.  If our customers cancel some of our contracts, and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms, or if contracts are suspended for an extended period of time or if a number of our contracts are renegotiated, it could adversely affect our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

 

 

Our current backlog of contract drilling revenue may not be fully realized.

 

 

At February 14, 2013, the contract backlog associated with our continuing operations was approximately $28.8 billion.  This amount represents the firm term of the contract multiplied by the contractual operating rate, which may be higher than the actual dayrate we receive or we may receive other dayrates included in the contract such as waiting on weather rate, repair rate, standby rate or force majeure rate.  The contractual operating dayrate may also be higher than the actual dayrate we receive because of a number of factors, including rig downtime or suspension of operations.

 

 

Several factors could cause rig downtime or a suspension of operations, including:

 





§  


breakdowns of equipment and other unforeseen engineering problems;




 





§  


work stoppages, including labor strikes;




 





§  


shortages of material and skilled labor;




 





§  


surveys by government and maritime authorities;




 





§  


periodic classification surveys;




 





§  


severe weather, strong ocean currents or harsh operating conditions; and




 





§  


force majeure events.




 

 

In certain contracts, the dayrate may be reduced to zero or result in customer credit against future dayrate if, for example, repairs extend beyond a stated period of time.  Our contract backlog includes signed drilling contracts and, in some cases, other definitive agreements awaiting contract execution.  We may not be able to realize the full amount of our contract backlog due to events beyond our control.  In addition, some of our customers have experienced liquidity issues in the past and these liquidity issues could be experienced again if commodity prices decline to lower levels for an extended period of time.  Liquidity issues could lead our customers to go into bankruptcy or could encourage our customers to seek to repudiate, cancel or renegotiate these agreements for various reasons, as described under “Our drilling contracts may be terminated due to a number of events” above.  Our inability to realize the full amount of our contract backlog may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The global nature of our operations involves additional risks.

 

 

We operate in various regions throughout the world, which may expose us to political and other uncertainties, including risks of:

 





§  


terrorist acts, war, piracy and civil unrest;




 





§  


seizure, expropriation or nationalization of our equipment;




 





§  


expropriation or nationalization of our customers’ property;




 





§  


repudiation or nationalization of contracts;




 





§  


imposition of trade barriers;




 





§  


import-export quotas;




 





§  


wage and price controls;




 





§  


changes in law and regulatory requirements, including changes in interpretation and enforcement;




 





§  


involvement in judicial proceedings in unfavorable jurisdictions;




 





§  


damage to our equipment or violence directed at our employees, including kidnappings;




 





§  


complications associated with supplying, repairing and replacing equipment in remote locations;




 





§  


the inability to move income or capital; and




 





§  


currency exchange fluctuations.




 

 

Our non-U.S. contract drilling operations are subject to various laws and regulations in certain countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations relating to the import and export, equipment and operation of drilling units, currency conversions and repatriation, oil and gas exploration and development, and taxation of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel.  We are also subject to the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) and other U.S. laws and regulations governing our international operations.  In addition, various state and municipal governments, universities and other investors have proposed or adopted divestment and other initiatives regarding investments (including, with respect to state governments, by state retirement systems) in companies that do business with countries that have been designated as state sponsors of terrorism by the U.S. State Department.  Our internal compliance program has identified and we have self-reported a potential OFAC compliance issue involving the shipment of goods by a freight forwarder through Iran, a country that has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism by the U.S. State Department.  See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Contingencies—Regulatory matters.”  We have also operated rigs in Myanmar, a country that is subject to some U.S. trading sanctions.  Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including those relating to sanctions and export restrictions, may subject us to criminal sanctions or civil remedies, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions or seizures of assets.  Investors could view any potential violations of OFAC regulations negatively, which could adversely affect our reputation and the market for our shares.

 

 

Governments in some foreign countries have become increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of concessions and companies holding concessions, the exploration for oil and gas and other aspects of the oil and gas industries in their countries, including local content requirements for participating in tenders for certain drilling contracts.  Many governments favor or effectively require the awarding of drilling contracts to local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction or require use of a local agent.  In addition, government action, including initiatives by OPEC, may continue to cause oil or gas price volatility.  In some areas of the world, this governmental activity has adversely affected the amount of exploration and development work by major oil companies and may continue to do so.

 

 

A substantial portion of our drilling contracts are partially payable in local currency.  Those amounts may exceed our local currency needs, leading to the accumulation of excess local currency, which, in certain instances, may be subject to either temporary blocking or other difficulties converting to U.S. dollars, our functional currency, or to other currencies in which we operate.  Excess amounts of local currency may be exposed to the risk of currency exchange losses.

 

 

The shipment of goods, services and technology across international borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations.  Our import and export activities are governed by unique customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate.  Moreover, many countries, including the U.S., control the import and export of certain goods, services and technology and impose related import and export recordkeeping and reporting obligations.  Governments also may impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons and other entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries, persons and entities, and we are also subject to the U.S. anti-boycott law.

 

 

The laws and regulations concerning import and export activity, recordkeeping and reporting, import and export control and economic sanctions are complex and constantly changing.  These laws and regulations may be enacted, amended, enforced or interpreted in a manner materially impacting our operations.  Ongoing economic challenges may increase some foreign governments’ efforts to enact, enforce, amend or interpret laws and regulations as a method to increase revenue.  Shipments can be delayed and denied import or export for a variety of reasons, some of which are outside our control and some of which may result from failure to comply with existing legal and regulatory regimes.  Shipping delays or denials could cause unscheduled operational downtime.

 

 

An inability to obtain visas and work permits for our employees on a timely basis could hurt our operations and have an adverse effect on our business.

 


Our ability to operate worldwide depends on our ability to obtain the necessary visas and work permits for our personnel to travel in and out of, and to work in, the jurisdictions in which we operate.  Governmental actions in some of the jurisdictions in which we operate may make it difficult for us to move our personnel in and out of these jurisdictions by delaying or withholding the approval of these permits.  For example, in the past few years, we have experienced considerable difficulty in obtaining the necessary visas and work permits for our employees to work in Angola, where we operate a number of rigs.  If we are not able to obtain visas and work permits for the employees we need to operate our rigs on a timely basis, we might not be able to perform our obligations under our drilling contracts, which could allow our customers to cancel the contracts.  If our customers cancel some of our contracts, and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms, it could adversely affect our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

     Our business involves numerous operating hazards.

 

 

Our operations are subject to the usual hazards inherent in the drilling of oil and gas wells, such as blowouts, reservoir damage, loss of production, loss of well control, punch-throughs, craterings, fires and natural disasters such as hurricanes and tropical storms.  We may also be subject to property, environmental and other damage claims by oil and gas companies.  Our insurance policies and contractual rights to indemnity may not adequately cover losses, and we do not have insurance coverage or rights to indemnity for all risks.  There are also risks following the loss of control of a well, such as a blowout or cratering, including the cost to regain control of or redrill the well and associated pollution.  Damage to the environment could also result from our operations, particularly through oil spillage or extensive uncontrolled fires.

 

 

The South China Sea, the Northwest Coast of Australia and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico area are subject to typhoons, hurricanes or other extreme weather conditions on a relatively frequent basis, and our drilling rigs in these regions may be exposed to damage or total loss by these storms, some of which may not be covered by insurance.  The occurrence of these events could result in the suspension of drilling operations, damage to or destruction of the equipment involved and injury to or death of rig personnel.  Some experts believe global climate change could increase the frequency and severity of these extreme weather conditions.  We are also subject to personal injury and other claims by rig personnel as a result of our drilling operations.  Operations also may be suspended because of machinery breakdowns, abnormal drilling conditions, failure of subcontractors to perform or supply goods or services, or personnel shortages.  In addition, offshore drilling operations are subject to perils peculiar to marine operations, including capsizing, grounding, collision and loss or damage from severe weather.

 

 

We have two main types of insurance coverage: (1) hull and machinery coverage for property damage and (2) excess liability coverage, which generally covers offshore risks, such as personal injury, third-party property claims, and third-party non-crew claims, including wreck removal and pollution.  We generally have no coverage for hull and machinery exposure for named storms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.  We also generally self-insure coverage for ADTI exposures related to well control and redrill liability for well blowouts.  However, in the event of a total loss of such a drilling unit there is no deductible.  We also maintain per occurrence deductibles on such rigs that generally range up to $10 million for various third-party liabilities and an additional aggregate annual self-insured retention of $50 million.  With respect to the remaining $775 million excess liability coverage, we generally retain the risk for any liability in excess of this coverage; however, our wholly-owned captive insurance company has underwritten the $50 million self-insured retention noted above.

 

 

If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance or an enforceable or recoverable indemnity from a customer or, with respect to the Standard Jackups we operate under operating agreements with Shelf Drilling for a transitional period, Shelf Drilling, it could adversely affect our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  The amount of our insurance may be less than the related impact on enterprise value after a loss.  Our insurance coverage will not in all situations provide sufficient funds to protect us from all liabilities that could result from our drilling operations.  Our coverage includes annual aggregate policy limits.  As a result, we generally retain the risk for any losses in excess of these limits.  We generally do not carry insurance for loss of revenue unless contractually required, and certain other claims may also not be reimbursed by insurance carriers.  Any such lack of reimbursement may cause us to incur substantial costs.  Moreover, no assurance can be made that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable or be able to obtain insurance against certain risks.

 

 

Failure to recruit and retain key personnel could hurt our operations.

 

 

We depend on the continuing efforts of key members of our management, as well as other highly skilled personnel, to operate and provide technical services and support for our business worldwide.  Historically, competition for the personnel required for drilling operations, including for turnkey drilling and drilling management services businesses and construction projects, has intensified as the number of rigs activated, added to worldwide fleets or under construction increased, leading to shortages of qualified personnel in the industry and creating upward pressure on wages and higher turnover.  We may experience a reduction in the experience level of our personnel as a result of any increased turnover, which could lead to higher downtime and more operating incidents, which in turn could decrease revenues and increase costs.  If increased competition for qualified personnel were to intensify in the future we may experience increases in costs or limits on operations.

Our labor costs and the operating restrictions under which we operate could increase as a result of collective bargaining negotiations and changes in labor laws and regulations.

 

 

Some of our employees working in Angola, the U.K., Nigeria, Norway, Australia and Brazil, are represented by, and some of our contracted labor work under, collective bargaining agreements.  Many of these represented individuals are working under agreements that are subject to annual salary negotiation.  These negotiations could result in higher personnel expenses, other increased costs or increased operational restrictions as the outcome of such negotiations apply to all offshore employees not just the union members.  Legislation has been introduced in the U.S. Congress that could encourage additional unionization efforts in the U.S., as well as increase the chances that such efforts succeed.  Additional unionization efforts, if successful, new collective bargaining agreements or work stoppages could materially increase our labor costs and operating restrictions.

 

 

Worldwide financial and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, profitability and financial position.

 

 

Worldwide financial and economic conditions could cause our ability to access the capital markets to be severely restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to access such markets, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions.  Worldwide economic conditions have in the past impacted, and could in the future impact, the lenders participating in our credit facilities and our customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us.  A slowdown in economic activity could reduce worldwide demand for energy and result in an extended period of lower oil and natural gas prices.  A decline in oil and natural gas prices, could reduce demand for our drilling services and have a material adverse effect on our revenue, profitability and financial position.

 

 

Failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 could result in fines, criminal penalties, drilling contract terminations and an adverse effect on our business.

 

 

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, which became effective on July 1, 2011, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.  We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices.  If we are found to be liable for FCPA violations or violations under the Bribery Act 2010, either due to our own acts or our omissions or due to the acts or omissions of others, including our partners in our various joint ventures, we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 

 

Civil penalties under the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA could range up to $10,000 per violation, with a criminal fine up to the greater of $2 million per violation or twice the gross pecuniary gain to us or twice the gross pecuniary loss to others, if larger.  Civil penalties under the accounting provisions of the FCPA can range up to $500,000 per violation and a company that knowingly commits a violation can be fined up to $25 million per violation.  In addition, both the SEC and the DOJ could assert that conduct extending over a period of time may constitute multiple violations for purposes of assessing the penalty amounts.  Often, dispositions for these types of matters result in modifications to business practices and compliance programs and possibly the appointment of a monitor to review future business and practices with the goal of ensuring compliance with the FCPA.  On November 4, 2010, we reached a settlement with the SEC and the DOJ with respect to certain charges relating to the anti-bribery and books and records provisions of the FCPA.  In November 2010, under the terms of the settlements, we paid a total of approximately $27 million in penalties, interest and disgorgement of profits.  We have also consented to the entry of a civil injunction in two SEC actions and have entered into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement with the DOJ (the “DPA”).  In connection with the DPA, we have agreed to implement and maintain certain internal controls, policies and procedures.  For the duration of the DPA, we are also obligated to provide an annual written report to the DOJ of our efforts and progress in maintaining and enhancing our compliance policies and procedures.  In the event the DOJ determines that we have knowingly violated the terms of the DPA, the DOJ may impose an extension of the term of the agreement or, if the DOJ determines we have breached the DPA, the DOJ may pursue criminal charges or a civil or administrative action against us.  The DOJ may also find, in its sole discretion, that a change in circumstances has eliminated the need for the corporate compliance reporting obligations of the DPA and may terminate the DPA prior to the three-year term.  Failure to comply with the terms of the DPA may impact our operations and any resulting fines may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows.

 

 

We could also face fines, sanctions and other penalties from authorities in the relevant foreign jurisdictions, including prohibition of our participating in or curtailment of business operations in those jurisdictions and the seizure of rigs or other assets.  Our customers in those jurisdictions could seek to impose penalties or take other actions adverse to our interests.  We could also face other third-party claims by agents, shareholders, debt holders, or other interest holders or constituents of our company.  In addition, disclosure of the subject matter of the investigation could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain new business or retain existing business from our current customers and potential customers, to attract and retain employees and to access the capital markets.  See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Contingencies—Regulatory matters.”

Regulation of greenhouse gases and climate change could have a negative impact on our business.

 

 

Some scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as “greenhouse gases” (“GHGs”) and including carbon dioxide and methane, may be contributing to warming of the Earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes.  In response to such studies, the issue of climate change and the effect of GHG emissions, in particular emissions from fossil fuels, is attracting increasing attention worldwide.

 

 

Legislation to regulate emissions of GHGs has been introduced in the U.S. Congress, and there has been a wide-ranging policy debate, both in the U.S. and internationally, regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation.  Some of the proposals would require industries to meet stringent new standards that would require substantial reductions in carbon emissions.  Those reductions could be costly and difficult to implement.  In addition, efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues, such as the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Doha in 2012.  Also, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has undertaken efforts to collect information regarding GHG emissions and their effects.  Following a finding by the EPA that certain GHGs represent an endangerment to human health, the EPA finalized motor vehicle GHG standards, the effect of which could reduce demand for motor fuels refined from crude oil, and a final rule to address permitting of GHG emissions from stationary sources under the Clean Air Act’s Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V programs commencing when the motor vehicle standards took effect on January 2, 2011.  Facilities containing petroleum and natural gas systems that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of CO2 equivalent per year are now required to report annual GHG emissions to the EPA.

 

 

Because our business depends on the level of activity in the offshore oil and gas industry, existing or future laws, regulations, treaties or international agreements related to GHGs and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have a negative impact on our business if such laws, regulations, treaties or international agreements reduce the worldwide demand for oil and gas or limit drilling opportunities.  In addition, such laws, regulations, treaties or international agreements could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, which may have a negative impact on our business.

 

 

We are subject to litigation that, if not resolved in our favor and not sufficiently insured against, could have a material adverse effect on us.

 

 

In addition to the litigation surrounding the Macondo well incident and the Frade field incident, we are subject to a variety of other litigation.  Certain of our subsidiaries are named as defendants in numerous lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos or toxic fumes or resulting from other occupational diseases, such as silicosis, and various other medical issues that can remain undiscovered for a considerable amount of time.  Some of these subsidiaries that have been put on notice of potential liabilities have no assets.  Further, our patent for dual-activity technology has been challenged, and we have been accused of infringing other patents.  Other subsidiaries are subject to litigation relating to environmental damage.  We cannot predict the outcome of the cases involving those subsidiaries or the potential costs to resolve them.  Insurance may not be applicable or sufficient in all cases, insurers may not remain solvent, and policies may not be located, and liabilities associated with the Macondo well incident may exhaust some or all of the insurance available to cover certain claims.  Suits against non-asset-owning subsidiaries have and may in the future give rise to alter ego or successor-in-interest claims against us and our asset-owning subsidiaries to the extent a subsidiary is unable to pay a claim or insurance is not available or sufficient to cover the claims.  We are also subject to a number of significant tax disputes, including a trial on criminal and civil charges that commenced in Norway in late 2012.  To the extent that one or more pending or future litigation matters is not resolved in our favor and is not covered by insurance, a material adverse effect on our financial results and condition could result.

 

 

Public health threats could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our financial results.

 

 

Public health threats, such as the H1N1 flu virus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, and other highly communicable diseases, outbreaks of which have already occurred in various parts of the world in which we operate, could adversely impact our operations, the operations of our customers and the global economy, including the worldwide demand for oil and natural gas and the level of demand for our services.  Any quarantine of personnel or inability to access our offices or rigs could adversely affect our operations.  Travel restrictions or operational problems in any part of the world in which we operate, or any reduction in the demand for drilling services caused by public health threats in the future, may materially impact operations and adversely affect our financial results.

 

 

Acts of terrorism, piracy and social unrest could affect the markets for drilling services.

 

 

Acts of terrorism and social unrest, brought about by world political events or otherwise, have caused instability in the world’s financial and insurance markets in the past and may occur in the future.  Such acts could be directed against companies such as ours.  In addition, acts of terrorism, piracy and social unrest could lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil and natural gas and could affect the markets for drilling services.  Insurance premiums could increase and coverages may be unavailable in the future.  U.S. government regulations may effectively preclude us from actively engaging in business activities in certain countries.  These regulations could be amended to cover countries where we currently operate or where we may wish to operate in the future.

 

 

Our contracts do not generally provide indemnification against loss of capital assets or loss revenues resulting from acts of terrorism, piracy or social unrest.  We have limited insurance coverage for physical damage losses resulting from risks, such as terrorist acts, piracy, civil unrest, expropriation and acts of war, for our assets, but we do not carry insurance for loss of revenues resulting from such risks.

Other risks

 

 

A change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation, of any country in which we have operations, are incorporated or are resident could result in a higher tax rate on our worldwide earnings, which could result in a significant negative impact on our earnings and cash flows from operations.

 

 

We operate worldwide through our various subsidiaries.  Consequently, we are subject to changes in applicable tax laws, treaties or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, which could include laws or policies directed toward companies organized in jurisdictions with low tax rates.  A material change in the tax laws or policies, or their interpretation, of any country in which we have significant operations, or in which we are incorporated or resident, could result in a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings and such change could be significant to our financial results.

 

 

Tax legislative proposals intending to eliminate some perceived tax advantages of companies that have legal domiciles outside the U.S., but have certain U.S. connections, have repeatedly been introduced in the U.S. Congress.  Recent examples include, but are not limited to, legislative proposals that would broaden the circumstances in which a non-U.S. company would be considered a U.S. resident, including the use of “management and control” provisions to determine corporate residency, and proposals that could override certain tax treaties and limit treaty benefits on certain payments by U.S. subsidiaries to non-U.S. affiliates.  Additionally, in November 2011 and again in February 2013, the U.S. Congress introduced a proposal which would disallow any deduction for otherwise tax deductible payments relating to any incident resulting in the discharge of oil into navigable waters, such as the Macondo well incident.  Any material change in tax laws or policies, or their interpretation, resulting from such legislative proposals or inquiries could result in a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings and such change could have a material adverse effect on our statement of financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

 

 

A loss of a major tax dispute or a successful tax challenge to our operating structure, intercompany pricing policies or the taxable presence of our key subsidiaries in certain countries could result in a higher tax rate on our worldwide earnings, which could result in a significant negative impact on our earnings and cash flows from operations.

 

 

We are a Swiss corporation that operates through our various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world.  Consequently, we are subject to tax laws, treaties and regulations in and between the countries in which we operate.  Our income taxes are based upon the applicable tax laws and tax rates in effect in the countries in which we operate and earn income as well as upon our operating structures in these countries.

 

 

Our income tax returns are subject to review and examination.  We do not recognize the benefit of income tax positions we believe are more likely than not to be disallowed upon challenge by a tax authority.  If any tax authority successfully challenges our operational structure, intercompany pricing policies or the taxable presence of our key subsidiaries in certain countries; or if the terms of certain income tax treaties are interpreted in a manner that is adverse to our structure; or if we lose a material tax dispute in any country, particularly in the U.S., Norway or Brazil, our effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings could increase substantially and our earnings and cash flows from operations could be materially adversely affected.  For example, there is considerable uncertainty as to the activities that constitute being engaged in a trade or business within the U.S. (or maintaining a permanent establishment under an applicable treaty), so we cannot be certain that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) will not contend successfully that we or any of our key subsidiaries were or are engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. (or, when applicable, maintained or maintains a permanent establishment in the U.S.).  If we or any of our key subsidiaries were considered to have been engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. (when applicable, through a permanent establishment), we could be subject to U.S. corporate income and additional branch profits taxes on the portion of our earnings effectively connected to such U.S. business during the period in which this was considered to have occurred, in which case our effective tax rate on worldwide earnings for that period could increase substantially, and our earnings and cash flows from operations for that period could be adversely affected.

 

 

The Norwegian authorities have issued criminal indictments against two of our subsidiaries alleging misleading or incomplete disclosures in Norwegian tax returns for the years of 1999 through 2002, as well as civil actions based upon inaccuracies in Norwegian statutory financial statements for the periods of 1996 through 2001.  This trial is currently ongoing.  We cannot be certain that the Norwegian authorities will not be successful in proving their allegations in a Norwegian court of law.  An unfavorable outcome on the Norwegian civil or criminal tax matters could result in a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

U.S. tax authorities could treat us as a "passive foreign investment company," which could have adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. holders.

 

 

A foreign corporation will be treated as a "passive foreign investment company," or PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes if either (1) at least 75 percent of its gross income for any taxable year consists of certain types of "passive income" or (2) at least 50 percent of the average value of the corporation's assets produce or are held for the production of those types of "passive income."  For purposes of these tests, “passive income” includes dividends, interest and gains from the sale or exchange of investment property and certain rents and royalties, but does not include income derived from the performance of services.

 

 

We believe that we have not been and will not be a PFIC with respect to any taxable year.  Our income from offshore contract drilling services should be treated as services income for purposes of determining whether we are a PFIC.  Accordingly, we believe that our income from our offshore contract drilling services should not constitute "passive income," and the assets that we own and operate in connection with the production of that income should not constitute passive assets.

 

 

There is significant legal authority supporting this position, including statutory provisions, legislative history, case law and IRS pronouncements concerning the characterization, for other tax purposes, of income derived from services where a substantial component of such income is attributable to the value of the property or equipment used in connection with providing such services.  It should be noted, however, that a recent case and an IRS pronouncement which relies on the recent case characterize income from time chartering of vessels as rental income rather than services income for other tax purposes.  However, the IRS subsequently has formally announced that it does not agree with the decision in that case.  Moreover, we believe that the terms of the time charters in the recent case differ in material respects from the terms of our drilling contracts with customers.  No assurance can be given that the IRS or a court will accept our position, and there is a risk that the IRS or a court could determine that we are a PFIC.

 

 

If we were to be treated as a PFIC for any taxable year, our U.S. shareholders would face adverse U.S. tax consequences.  Under the PFIC rules, unless a shareholder makes certain elections available under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (which elections could themselves have adverse consequences for such shareholder), such shareholder would be liable to pay U.S. federal income tax at the highest applicable income tax rates on ordinary income upon the receipt of excess distributions (as defined for U.S. tax purposes) and upon any gain from the disposition of our shares, plus interest on such amounts, as if such excess distribution or gain had been recognized ratably over the shareholder’s holding period of our shares.  In addition, under applicable statutory provisions, the preferential 15 percent tax rate on “qualified dividend income,” which applies to dividends paid to non-corporate shareholders prior to 2011, does not apply to dividends paid by a foreign corporation if the foreign corporation is a PFIC for the taxable year in which the dividend is paid or the preceding taxable year.

 

 

We have significant carrying amounts of goodwill and long-lived assets that are subject to impairment testing.

 

 

At December 31, 2012, the carrying amount of our property and equipment was $20.9 billion, representing 61 percent of our total assets, and the carrying amount of our goodwill was $3.0 billion, representing nine percent of our total assets.  In accordance with our critical accounting policies, we review our property and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts of our assets held and used may not be recoverable, and we conduct impairment testing for our goodwill when events and circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit may have fallen below its carrying amount.

 

 

In the year ended December 31, 2012, in connection with the sale of 38 drilling units to Shelf Drilling, we recognized losses of $744 million and $112 million on the impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill, respectively, attributable to the transactions.  As a result of our goodwill impairment test, performed as of October 1, 2011, we recognized aggregate losses of $5.3 billion on the impairment of goodwill associated with our contract drilling services reporting unit due to a decline in projected cash flows and market valuations for this reporting unit.  Future expectations of low dayrates or rig utilization rates could result in the recognition of additional losses on impairment of our long-lived asset groups, particularly with respect to our High-Specification Jackups, or our goodwill if future cash flow expectations, based upon information available to management at the time of measurement, indicate that the carrying amount of our asset groups or goodwill may be impaired.

We have significant exposure to losses resulting from our contractual relationships with Shelf Drilling and its affiliates.

 

 

In connection with our sale transactions with Shelf Drilling, we have agreed to indemnify Shelf from certain liabilities, and Shelf Drilling has agreed to indemnify us from certain liabilities and make certain payments to us.  However, the indemnity from Shelf Drilling may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of liabilities to third parties, and Shelf Drilling may not be willing or able to satisfy its indemnification or payment obligations in the future.

 

 

Pursuant to the agreements we entered into with Shelf Drilling, including purchase agreements, operating agreements with respect to rigs that we continue to operate on behalf of Shelf Drilling and a transition services agreement, we have agreed to indemnify Shelf Drilling from certain liabilities, and Shelf Drilling has agreed to indemnify us from certain liabilities (including, without limitation, liabilities related to operational risks with respect to Shelf Drilling's rigs, liabilities related to credit support we are providing to Shelf Drilling and certain liabilities related to employees) and make certain payments to us.  However, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for the liabilities with respect to which Shelf Drilling has agreed to indemnify us.  In addition, the indemnity may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, and Shelf Drilling may not be willing or able to satisfy its indemnification or payment obligations to us. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Shelf Drilling any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves.  Each of these risks could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

 

 

We may be limited in our use of net operating losses.

 

 

Our ability to benefit from our deferred tax assets depends on us having sufficient future earnings to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards before they expire.  We have established a valuation allowance against the future tax benefit for a number of our non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, and we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance against our non-U.S. or U.S. deferred tax assets if market conditions change materially and, as a result, our future earnings are, or are projected to be, significantly less than we currently estimate.  Our net operating loss carryforwards are subject to review and potential disallowance upon audit by the tax authorities of the jurisdictions where the net operating losses are incurred.

 

 

Our status as a Swiss corporation may limit our flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management and may cause us to be unable to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting our shareholders to Swiss withholding tax.

 

 

Swiss law allows our shareholders to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without additional shareholder approval, but this authorization is limited to 50 percent of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed by the shareholders every two years.  At the annual general meeting on May 13, 2011, our shareholders approved our current authorized share capital, which expires on May 13, 2013 and was limited to 19.99 percent of our existing share capital.  In connection with our December 2011 and May 2012 issuance of new shares, our available authorized share capital decreased to 7.61 percent of our existing stated share capital.  Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, Swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares.  Swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions.  In the event we need to raise common equity capital at a time when the trading price of our shares is below the par value of the shares, currently CHF 15, equivalent to $16.13 based on a foreign exchange rate of CHF 0.93 to USD 1.00 on February 20, 2013, we will need to obtain approval of shareholders to decrease the par value of our shares or issue another class of shares with a lower par value.  Any reduction in par value would decrease our par value available for future repayment of share capital not subject to Swiss withholding tax.  Swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions.  For example, dividends must be approved by shareholders.  These Swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility, and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders.

 

 

Distributions to shareholders in the form of a par value reduction and dividend distributions out of qualifying additional paid-in capital are not currently subject to the 35 percent Swiss federal withholding tax.  Dividend distributions out of qualifying additional paid-in capital do not require registration with the Commercial Register of the Canton of Zug.  However, the Swiss withholding tax rules could also be changed in the future.  Due to the continuing debate in the Swiss political arena, we cannot provide assurance that the current Swiss law with respect to distributions out of additional paid-in capital will not be changed or that a change in Swiss law will not adversely affect us or our shareholders, in particular as a result of distributions out of additional paid-in capital becoming subject to Swiss federal withholding tax or subject to additional corporate law restrictions.  In addition, over the long term, the amount of par value available for us to use for par value reductions or the amount of qualifying additional paid-in capital available for us to pay out as distributions is limited.  If we are unable to make a distribution through a reduction in par value, or out of qualifying additional paid-in capital as shown on Transocean Ltd.’s standalone Swiss statutory financial statements, we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting our shareholders to Swiss withholding taxes.

 


Under present Swiss tax law, repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to a 35 percent Swiss withholding tax on the repurchase price less the par value, and since January 1, 2011, to the extent attributable to qualifying additional paid-in capital, if any.  At our 2009 annual general meeting, our shareholders approved the repurchase of up to CHF 3.5 billion of our shares for cancellation (the “Share Repurchase Program”).  On February 12, 2010, our board of directors authorized our management to implement the Share Repurchase Program.  We may repurchase shares under the Share Repurchase Program via a second trading line on the SIX from institutional investors who are generally able to receive a full refund of the Swiss withholding tax.  Alternatively, in relation to the U.S. market, we may repurchase shares under the Share Repurchase Program using an alternative procedure pursuant to which we can repurchase shares under the Share Repurchase Program via a “virtual second trading line” from market players (in particular, banks and institutional investors) who are generally entitled to receive a full refund of the Swiss withholding tax.  There may not be sufficient liquidity in our shares on the SIX to repurchase the amount of shares that we would like to repurchase using the second trading line on the SIX.  In addition, our ability to use the “virtual second trading line” is limited to the share repurchase program currently approved by our shareholders, and any use of the “virtual second trading line” with respect to future share repurchase programs will require the approval of the competent Swiss tax and other authorities.  We may not be able to repurchase as many shares as we would like to repurchase for purposes of capital reduction on either the “virtual second trading line” or, in the future, a SIX second trading line without subjecting the selling shareholders to Swiss withholding taxes.

We are subject to anti-takeover provisions.

 

 

Our articles of association and Swiss law contain provisions that could prevent or delay an acquisition of the company by means of a tender offer, a proxy contest or otherwise.  These provisions may also adversely affect prevailing market prices for our shares.  These provisions, among other things:

 





§  


classify our board into three classes of directors, each of which serve for staggered three-year periods;




 





§  


provide that the board of directors is authorized, subject to obtaining shareholder approval every two years, at any time during a maximum two-year period, which is currently scheduled to expire on May 13, 2013, to issue up to a specified number of shares, currently approximately 7.61 percent of the share capital registered in the commercial register, and to limit or withdraw the preemptive rights of existing shareholders in various circumstances, including (1) following a shareholder or group of shareholders acting in concert having acquired in excess of 15 percent of the share capital registered in the commercial register without having submitted a takeover proposal to shareholders that is recommended by the board of directors or (2) for purposes of the defense of an actual, threatened or potential unsolicited takeover bid, in relation to which the board of directors has, upon consultation with an independent financial adviser retained by the board of directors, not recommended acceptance to the shareholders;




 





§  


provide for a conditional share capital that authorizes the issuance of additional shares up to a maximum amount of 50 percent of the share capital registered in the commercial register without obtaining additional shareholder approval through: (1) the exercise of conversion, exchange, option, warrant or similar rights for the subscription of shares granted in connection with bonds, options, warrants or other securities newly or already issued in national or international capital markets or new or already existing contractual obligations by or of any of our subsidiaries; or (2) in connection with the issuance of shares, options or other share-based awards;




 





§  


provide that any shareholder who wishes to propose any business or to nominate a person or persons for election as director at any annual meeting may only do so if advance notice is given to the company;




 





§  


provide that directors can be removed from office only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3 percent of the shares entitled to vote;




 





§  


provide that a merger or demerger transaction requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3 percent of the shares represented at the meeting and provide for the possibility of a so-called “cashout” or “squeezeout” merger if the acquirer controls 90 percent of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at the meeting;




 





§  


provide that any action required or permitted to be taken by the holders of shares must be taken at a duly called annual or extraordinary general meeting of shareholders;




 





§  


limit the ability of our shareholders to amend or repeal some provisions of our articles of association; and




 





§  


limit transactions between us and an “interested shareholder,” which is generally defined as a shareholder that, together with its affiliates and associates, beneficially, directly or indirectly, owns 15 percent or more of our shares entitled to vote at a general meeting.




 

 





Item 1B
