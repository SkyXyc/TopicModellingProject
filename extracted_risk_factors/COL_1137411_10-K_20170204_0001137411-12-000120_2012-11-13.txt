.Risk Factors.Reduction in U.S. Government spending may adversely impact Government Systems sales and profitability.In 2012, 38 percent of our sales were derived from U.S. Government contracts, both directly and indirectly through subcontracts. Defense funding by the U.S. Government faces significant pressures and is expected to decline over the next few years due to the overall economic environment, budget deficits and competing budget priorities. Cost cutting, efficiency initiatives, reprioritization and other affordability analysis by the U.S. Government on defense spending could present some additional opportunities for us, but overall may adversely impact our Government Systems sales and profitability. Unless the U.S. Government takes further action, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (Budget Act) will trigger substantial, automatic reductions in both defense and discretionary spending in January 2013. While the impact of sequestration is yet to be determined, automatic across-the-board cuts would be in addition to reductions already reflected in the defense funding over a ten-year period. The resulting automatic across-the-board budget cuts in sequestration could have significant consequences to our business and industry. There could be disruption of ongoing programs and initiatives and personnel reductions that could severely impact advanced manufacturing operations and engineering expertise, and accelerate the loss of skills and knowledge.We offer a diverse range of defense products and services. We believe that this makes it less likely that cuts in any specific contract or program will have a long-term effect on our business; however, termination of multiple or large programs or contracts could adversely affect our business and future financial performance. Potential changes in funding priorities may afford new or additional opportunities for our businesses in terms of existing, follow-on or replacement programs. While we would expect to compete, and be well positioned as the incumbent on existing programs, we may not be successful, and any replacement programs may be funded at lower levels.In years when the U.S. Government does not complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year (September 30), government operations typically are funded through a continuing resolution that authorizes agencies of the U.S. Government to continue to operate, but does not authorize new spending initiatives. When the U.S. Government operates under a continuing resolution, delays can occur in the procurement of products and services. Should a continuing resolution be prolonged further or extended through all or a large part of the government fiscal year, it may cause procurement awards to shift and cause our revenues to vary between periods.During periods covered by continuing resolutions (or until the regular appropriation bills are passed), we may experience delays in procurement of products and services due to lack of funding, and those delays may affect our results of operations. At times, we may continue to work without funding, and use our own funds in order to meet our customer's desired delivery dates for products or services. It is uncertain at this time which of our programs' funding could be reduced in future years or whether new legislation will be passed by Congress in the next fiscal year that could result in additional or alternative funding cuts.8We depend to a significant degree on U.S. Government contracts, which are subject to unique risks.In addition to normal business risks, our supply of systems and products to the U.S. Government is subject to unique risks which are largely beyond our control. These risks include:•dependence on Congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds•the ability of the U.S. Government to terminate, without prior notice, partially completed government programs and contracts that were previously authorized•changes in governmental procurement legislation and regulations and other policies which may reflect military and political developments•significant changes in contract scheduling or program structure, which generally result in delays or reductions in deliveries•intense competition for available U.S. Government business necessitating increases in time and investment for design and development•difficulty of forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work•changes over the life of U.S. Government contracts, particularly development contracts, which generally result in adjustments of contract prices•claims based on U.S. Government work and violation of associated compliance and other requirements, which may result in fines, the cancellation or suspension of payments or suspension or debarment proceedings affecting potential further business with the U.S. GovernmentInternational conflicts and terrorism may adversely affect our business.International conflicts such as the war in Afghanistan, political turmoil in the Middle and Far East and the possibility of future terrorist attacks cause significant uncertainty with respect to U.S. and other business and financial markets and may adversely affect our business. These international conflicts also affect the price of oil, which has a significant impact on the financial health of our commercial customers. Although our Government Systems business may experience greater demand for its products as a result of increased government defense spending, factors arising (directly or indirectly) from international conflicts or terrorism which may adversely affect our commercial business include reduced aircraft build rates, upgrades, maintenance and spending on discretionary products such as in-flight entertainment, as well as increases in the cost of property and aviation products insurance and increased restrictions placed on our insurance policies. Our business is heavily concentrated in the aviation industry.As a provider of products and services to the aviation industry, we are significantly affected by the overall economic condition of that industry. The aviation industry is historically cyclical.Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted, among other things, by the following:•reductions in demand for aircraft and delayed aircraft delivery schedules•challenges in the financial condition of some of our existing and potential customers•reductions in the need for, or the deferral of, aircraft maintenance and repair services and spare parts support•retirement or storage of older generation aircraft, resulting in fewer retrofits and less demand for services for those aircraft•limited availability of financing for airlines or aircraft•high fuel costs9•health pandemics or other disruptions to commercial air travel demandNew airspace management technologies may impact future sales.The aerospace industry is experiencing a global transition from traditional communications, navigation, surveillance and air traffic control systems to air traffic management systems utilizing satellite-based technologies that will allow pilots to fly at desired paths and speeds selected in real time, while still complying with instrument flight regulations. The transition to these technologies will require the use of digital communications systems, global positioning system navigation, satellite surveillance techniques and ground surveillance systems. These technologies are expected to result in more direct and efficient flight routes, fewer flight delays and reduced airport congestion. Although we believe that we are well positioned to participate in this market evolution, our ability to capitalize on the transition to these airspace management technologies is subject to various risks, including:•delays in the development of the necessary satellite and ground infrastructure by the U.S. and other governments•delays in adopting national and international regulatory standards•competitors developing better products•failure of our product development investments in communications, navigation and surveillance products that enable airspace management technologies to coincide with market evolution to, and demand for, these products•the ability and desire of customers to invest in products enabling airspace management technologies A global or regional recession may adversely affect us.If a recession emerges that impacts where we do business, risks may include:•declines in revenues, profitability and cash flows from reduced orders, payment delays or other factors caused by the economic problems of our customers•adverse impacts on our access to short-term commercial paper borrowings or other credit sources•supply problems associated with any financial constraints faced by our suppliersWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from international sales and are subject to the risks of doing business outside the U.S.In 2012, 33 percent of our total revenues were from sales of our products and services internationally. We expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total sales. As a result, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including:•laws, regulations and policies of non-U.S. governments relating to investments and operations, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad•regulatory requirements and potential changes, including imposition of tariffs or embargoes, export controls and other trade restrictions and antitrust and data privacy requirements•changes in government spending on defense programs, including the potential spending decline in European countries•uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding, credit or guarantees•requirements of certain customers which obligate us to specified levels of in-country purchases, manufacturing or investments, known as offsets, and penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements •import and export licensing requirements and regulations•uncertainties as to local laws and enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights10•rapid changes in government, economic and political policies, political or civil unrest or the threat of international boycotts or U.S. anti-boycott legislationWe have made, and expect to continue to make, strategic acquisitions that involve significant risks and uncertainties.We completed three acquisitions in the last three years and we intend to make acquisitions in the future in an effort to enhance shareowner value. Acquisitions involve a certain amount of risks and uncertainties such as: •the difficulty in integrating newly-acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and cost-effective manner and the risk that we encounter significant unanticipated costs or other problems associated with integration•the challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other benefits expected from acquisitions•the risk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the technologies acquired do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets•the risk that we assume significant liabilities that exceed the limitations of any applicable indemnification provisions or the financial resources of any indemnifying parties•the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses•the risk of diverting the attention of senior management from our existing operationsWe enter into fixed-price contracts that could subject us to losses in the event that we have cost overruns.During 2012, approximately 93 percent of our total sales were from, and a significant portion of our anticipated future sales will be from, fixed-price contracts. This allows us to benefit from cost savings, but it carries the burden of potential cost overruns since we assume all of the cost risk. If our initial cost estimates are incorrect, we can incur losses on these contracts. These fixed-price contracts can expose us to potentially large losses because the customer may compel us to complete a project or, in the event of a termination for default, pay the entire incremental cost of its replacement by another provider regardless of the size of any cost overruns that occur over the life of the contract. Because many of these projects involve new technologies and applications and can last for years, unforeseen events such as technological difficulties, fluctuations in the price of raw materials, problems with subcontractors and cost overruns can result in the contractual price becoming less favorable or even unprofitable to us over time. Furthermore, if we do not meet project deadlines or specifications, we may need to renegotiate contracts on less favorable terms, be forced to pay penalties or liquidated damages or suffer major losses if the customer exercises its right to terminate. In addition, some of our contracts have provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights, and if we fail to meet the terms specified in those contracts we may not realize their full benefits. Our results of operations are dependent on our ability to maximize our earnings from our contracts. Lower earnings caused by cost overruns could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.Costs of certain employee and retiree benefits may continue to rise.Although we have taken action seeking to contain volatility in the costs related to medical and pension benefits, there are risks that our costs for these benefits will increase as a result of:•continued increases in medical costs related to current employees due to increased usage of medical benefits, medical inflation and the impact of recent U.S. Government health care legislation•material changes in legislation or market dynamics as a result impacting medical or pension matters•the effect declines in the stock and bond markets have on the performance of our pension plan assets•potential reductions in the discount rate used to determine the present value of our retirement benefit obligations11Tax changes could affect our effective tax rate and future profitability.Our future results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of changes in our overall profitability and changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax legislation, the results of audits and examination of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessment of our tax exposures.We depend on critical suppliers and subcontractors.We do not always have alternate sources of supply readily available for certain goods or services, such as liquid crystal displays. The loss of a significant supplier or subcontractor or their inability to meet performance, quality or delivery requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.We depend on specialized test equipment.Some of our specialized test equipment that supports the reliability of our products and systems is the result of significant investment. Back-up test equipment may not be readily available. Damage to our specialized test equipment may result in protracted production recovery.A cybersecurity incident could have negative impact.A cyber-attack that bypasses our information technology (IT) security systems causing an IT security breach, may lead to a material disruption of our IT business systems and/or the loss of business information resulting in adverse business impact. Risks may include:  •future results could be adversely affected due to the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of confidential data or intellectual property •operational or business delays resulting from the disruption of IT systems and subsequent mitigation activities•negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with our customers, partners or industry peers Cautionary StatementThis Annual Report on Form 10-K, and documents that are incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, contain statements, including certain projections and business trends, that are forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
