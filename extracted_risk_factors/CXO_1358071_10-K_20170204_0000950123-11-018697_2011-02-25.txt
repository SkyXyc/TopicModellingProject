    Reserve engineering is a process of estimating underground
    accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in
    an exact way. The accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on
    the quality of available data, the interpretation of such data
    and price and cost assumptions made by our reserve engineers. In
    addition, the results of drilling, testing and production
    activities may justify revisions of estimates that were made
    previously. If significant, such revisions would change the
    schedule of any further production and development drilling.
    Accordingly, reserve estimates may differ from the quantities of
    oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered.

    Business






 



    General


 


    Concho Resources Inc., a Delaware corporation
    (“Concho,” “Company,” “we,”
    “us” and “our”), formed in February 2006, is
    an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the
    acquisition, development and exploration of oil and natural gas
    properties. Our core operating areas are located in the Permian
    Basin region of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas, a large
    onshore oil and natural gas basin in the United States. The
    Permian Basin is one of the most prolific oil and natural gas
    producing regions in the United States and is characterized by
    an extensive production history, mature infrastructure, long
    reserve life, multiple producing horizons and enhanced recovery
    potential. We refer to our three core operating areas as the
    (i) New Mexico Shelf, where we primarily target the Yeso
    and Lower Abo formations, (ii) Delaware Basin, where we
    primarily target the Bone Spring formation, and (iii) Texas
    Permian, where we primarily target the Wolfberry, a term applied
    to the combined Wolfcamp and Spraberry horizons. We intend to
    grow our reserves and production through development drilling
    and exploration activities on our multi-year project inventory
    and through acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial
    objectives.



 



    Acquisitions


 



    Marbob
    and Settlement Acquisitions


 


    In July 2010, we entered into an asset purchase agreement to
    acquire certain of the oil and natural gas leases, interests,
    properties and related assets owned by Marbob Energy Corporation
    and its affiliates (collectively, “Marbob”) for
    aggregate consideration of (i) cash in the amount of
    $1.45 billion, (ii) the issuance to Marbob of a
    $150 million 8% unsecured senior note due 2018 and
    (iii) the issuance to Marbob of approximately
    1.1 million shares of our common stock, subject to purchase
    price adjustments, which included downward purchase price
    adjustments based on the exercise of third parties of
    contractual preferential purchase rights in properties to be
    acquired from Marbob (the “Marbob Acquisition”).


 


    On October 7, 2010, we closed the Marbob Acquisition. At
    closing, we paid approximately $1.1 billion in cash plus
    the unsecured senior note and common stock described above for a
    total purchase price of approximately $1.4 billion. The
    total purchase price as originally announced was reduced due to
    third party contractual preferential purchase rights in the
    Marbob properties. Certain of the third parties’
    contractual preferential purchase rights became subject to
    litigation, as discussed below.


 


    We funded the cash consideration in the Marbob Acquisition with
    (a) borrowings under our credit facility and (b) net
    proceeds of $292.7 million from a private placement of
    approximately 6.6 million shares of our common stock at a
    price of $45.30 per share that closed on October 7, 2010.


 


    Certain of the Marbob interests in properties contained
    contractual preferential purchase rights by third parties if
    Marbob were to sell them. Marbob informed us of its receipt of a
    notice from BP America Production Company (“BP”)
    electing to exercise its contractual preferential purchase
    rights.


 


    On July 20, 2010, BP announced it was selling all its
    assets in the Permian Basin to a subsidiary of Apache
    Corporation (“Apache”). Marbob and BP owned common
    interests in certain properties subject to contractual
    preferential purchase rights. BP and Apache contested
    Marbob’s ability to exercise its contractual preferential
    purchase rights in this situation. As a result, we and Marbob
    filed suit against BP and Apache seeking declaratory judgment
    and injunctive relief to protect Marbob’s contractual right
    to have the option to purchase the interests in these common
    properties.


 


    On October 15, 2010, we and Marbob resolved the litigation
    with BP and Apache related to the disputed contractual
    preferential purchase rights. As a result of the settlement, we
    acquired a non-operated interest in substantially all of the oil
    and natural gas assets subject to the litigation for
    approximately $286 million in cash (the “Settlement
    Acquisition”). We funded the Settlement Acquisition with
    borrowings under our credit facility.

Table of Contents





    The properties acquired in the Marbob and Settlement
    Acquisitions are primarily located in the Permian Basin of
    Southeast New Mexico, including a large acreage position
    contiguous to our core Yeso play on the southeast New Mexico
    Shelf and a significant acreage position in the Bone Spring play
    in the Delaware Basin. The assets acquired in the Marbob and
    Settlement Acquisitions contained approximately 72.4 MMBoe
    of proved reserves at closing. The results of operations prior
    to October 2010 do not include results from the Marbob and
    Settlement Acquisitions.


 



    Wolfberry
    Acquisitions


 


    In December 2009, together with the acquisition of related
    additional interests that closed in early 2010, we closed two
    acquisitions of interests in producing and non-producing assets
    in the Wolfberry play in Texas for approximately
    $270.7 million in cash (the “Wolfberry
    Acquisitions”). The Wolfberry Acquisitions contained
    approximately 19.9 MMBoe of proved reserves. The Wolfberry
    Acquisitions were primarily funded with borrowings under our
    credit facility. The results of operations prior to 2010 do not
    include results from the Wolfberry Acquisitions.


 



    Henry
    Entities Acquisition


 


    On July 31, 2008, we closed our acquisition of Henry
    Petroleum LP and certain entities affiliated with Henry
    Petroleum LP (which we refer to collectively as the “Henry
    Entities”), together with certain additional non-operated
    interests in oil and natural gas properties from persons
    affiliated with the Henry Entities. In August 2008 and September
    2008, we acquired additional non-operated interests in oil and
    natural gas properties from persons affiliated with the Henry
    Entities (known as “along-side interests”). The assets
    acquired in the acquisition of the Henry Entities and the
    along-side interests (which we refer to as the “Henry
    Properties”) contained approximately 30.1 MMBoe of
    proved reserves at closing. The Henry Properties are primarily
    located in the Wolfberry play of the Permian Basin. We paid
    approximately $583.7 million in net cash for the Henry
    Properties, which was funded with (i) borrowings under our
    credit facility and (ii) net proceeds of approximately
    $242.4 million from our private placement of
    8.3 million shares of our common stock. The results of
    operations prior to August 2008 do not include results from the
    Henry Properties acquisition.



 



    Divestiture


 


    In December 2010, we sold certain of our non-core Permian Basin
    assets for cash consideration of $103.3 million. For 2010,
    these assets produced 1,393 Boe per day, of which approximately
    46 percent was oil. The proved reserves of these assets
    were approximately 6.0 MMBoe at closing.



 



    Business
    and Properties


 


    Our core operations are focused in the Permian Basin of
    Southeast New Mexico and West Texas. It underlies an area of
    Southeast New Mexico and West Texas approximately 250 miles
    wide and 300 miles long. Commercial accumulations of
    hydrocarbons occur in multiple stratigraphic horizons, at depths
    ranging from approximately 1,000 feet to over
    25,000 feet. At December 31, 2010, 97.5 percent
    of our total estimated proved reserves were located in our core
    operating areas and consisted of approximately 65 percent
    oil and 35 percent natural gas. We have assembled a
    multi-year inventory of development drilling and exploration
    projects, including projects to further evaluate (i) the
    aerial extent of the Yeso formation and the Wolfberry play and
    (ii) the exploration potential in the Bone Spring and
    Wolfcamp formations in the Delaware Basin and the Lower Abo
    horizontal oil play, which we believe will allow us to grow
    proved reserves and production.


 


    We continually evaluate opportunities that could develop into an
    emerging play. We view an emerging play as an area where we can
    acquire large undeveloped acreage positions and apply horizontal
    drilling
    and/or
    advanced fracture stimulation technologies to achieve economic
    and repeatable production results.

    We produced approximately 15.6 MMBoe and 10.9 MMBoe of
    oil and natural gas during 2010 and 2009, respectively. In
    addition, we increased our average daily production from
    30.6 MBoe during the fourth quarter of 2009 to
    54.4 MBoe during the fourth quarter of 2010, of which the
    fourth quarter of 2010 included daily production of
    12.4 MBoe from the Marbob and Settlement Acquisitions.
    During 2010, we increased our total estimated proved reserves by
    approximately 111.9 MMBoe, including acquisitions of
    74.8 MMBoe.

    Our Standardized Measure at December 31, 2010 was
    $4,176.1 million. The present value of estimated future net
    revenues discounted at an annual rate of 10 percent
    (“PV-10”)
    is not a GAAP financial measure and is derived from the
    Standardized Measure which is the most directly comparable GAAP
    financial measure.
    PV-10 is a
    computation of the Standardized Measure on a pre-tax basis.
    PV-10 is
    equal to the Standardized Measure at the applicable date, before
    deducting future income taxes, discounted at 10 percent. We
    believe that the presentation of the
    PV-10 is
    relevant and useful to investors because it presents the
    discounted future net cash flows attributable to our estimated
    proved reserves prior to taking into account future corporate
    income taxes, and it is a useful measure for evaluating the
    relative monetary significance of our oil and natural gas
    assets. Further, investors may utilize the measure as a basis
    for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to
    other companies. We use this measure when assessing the
    potential return on investment related to our oil and natural
    gas assets.
    PV-10,
    however, is not a substitute for the Standardized Measure. Our
    PV-10
    measure and the Standardized Measure do not purport to present
    the fair value of our oil and natural gas reserves. See
    “Item 1. Business — Non-GAAP Financial
    Measures and Reconciliations.”

    Includes production, from the respective close dates in October
    2010, from the Marbob and Settlement Acquisitions of
    1,139 MBoe (3,120 Boe of daily production for 2010). Also,
    includes production of 508 MBoe (1,393 Boe of daily
    production for 2010) for the assets divested in December
    2010.




 



    Core
    operating areas


 


    New Mexico Shelf.  This area represents
    our most significant concentration of assets and, at
    December 31, 2010, we had estimated proved reserves in this
    area of 192.9 MMBoe, or 59.6 percent of our total
    proved reserves and 65.6 percent of our
    PV-10.


 


    Within this area we target two distinct producing areas, which
    we refer to as the shelf assets and the Lower Abo assets. The
    shelf assets generally produce out of vertical wells from the
    Yeso, San Andres and Grayburg formations, with producing
    depths ranging from approximately 900 feet to
    7,500 feet. The Lower Abo is a horizontal oil play just
    north and northeast of the shelf assets in Lea, Eddy and Chaves
    Counties, New Mexico. The Lower Abo play is found at vertical
    depths ranging from 6,500 feet to 10,000 feet and is
    being developed utilizing horizontal drilling techniques and
    advanced fracture and stimulation technology.


 


    During the year ended December 31, 2010, we commenced
    drilling or participated in the drilling of 270 (220 net)
    wells in this area, of which 227 (189 net) wells were completed
    as producers and 43 (32 net) wells were in various stages of
    drilling and completion at December 31, 2010. Additionally,
    at December 31, 2010, we had 6 (5 net) wells that were
    pending completion which were drilled prior to the closing of
    the Marbob Acquisition. During 2010, we continued our
    development of the Yeso formation on 10 acre spacing.


 


    At December 31, 2010, we had 219,825 gross (114,210
    net) acres in this area. At December 31, 2010, on our
    assets in this area, we had identified 2,897 (1,889 net)
    drilling locations, with proved undeveloped reserves attributed
    to 742 (580 net) of such locations. Of these drilling locations,
    we identified 2,156 (1,287 net) drilling locations intended to
    evaluate the Yeso formation.


 


    Delaware Basin.  This area represents a
    new core area for us as a result of the Marbob Acquisition. At
    December 31, 2010, we had estimated proved reserves in this
    area of 22.1 MMBoe, or 6.8 percent of our total proved
    reserves and 5.9 percent of our
    PV-10.


 


    Within this area we utilize horizontal drilling and fracturing
    technologies to target the oil prone Bone Spring formation that
    includes three Bone Spring sandstone members and the Avalon
    Shale member. Additionally, we utilize vertical drilling and
    multistage fracturing to target the oil prone “Wolfbone
    formation,” a new emerging opportunity that is a
    combination of stacked unconventional reservoir intervals of the
    Bone Spring formation and the Wolfcamp formation. These
    formations produce from 4,700 feet to 13,500 feet for
    our currently targeted activity. Traditionally, the greater
    Delaware Basin has produced from the deeper, natural gas prone
    Morrow, Atoka and Strawn formations, as well as from the oil
    prone Bone Spring and Delaware formations, with producing depths
    ranging from 5,000 feet to 15,000 feet.


 


    During the year ended December 31, 2010, we commenced
    drilling or participated in the drilling of 25 (13 net) wells in
    this area, of which 8 (2 net) wells were completed as producers
    and 17 (11 net) wells were in various stages of drilling and
    completion at December 31, 2010. Additionally, at
    December 31, 2010, we had 15 (8 net) wells that were
    pending completion that were drilled prior to the closing of the
    Marbob Acquisition. During 2010, we (i) continued
    Marbob’s and our development and step-out activity on the
    Avalon Shale and Bone Spring formations, (ii) implemented
    and evaluated larger fracture stimulation procedures in the
    completion of certain horizontal wells, and (iii) drilled
    the first well to evaluate the effectiveness of modern fracture
    stimulation procedures in the Wolfbone formation.


 


    At December 31, 2010, we had 266,962 gross (148,457
    net) acres in this area. At December 31, 2010, on our
    assets in this area, we had identified 1,101 (497 net) drilling
    locations, with proved undeveloped reserves attributed to 83 (33
    net) of such locations. Of these locations, we identified 968
    (442 net) locations intended to evaluate the Bone Spring
    formation.


 


    Texas Permian.  At December 31,
    2010, our estimated proved reserves of 100.5 MMBoe in this
    area accounted for 31.1 percent of our total proved
    reserves and 26.3 percent of our
    PV-10 value.

    Our primary objective in the Texas Permian area is the Wolfberry
    in the Midland Basin. “Wolfberry” is the term applied
    to the combined production from the Spraberry and Wolfcamp
    horizons out of vertical wellbores, which are typically
    encountered at depths of 7,500 feet to 10,500 feet.
    These formations are comprised of a sequence of basinal,
    interbedded sands, shales and carbonates. We also operate and
    develop properties on the Central Basin Platform targeting the
    Grayburg, San Andres and Clearfork formations, which are
    shallower, and are typically encountered at depths of
    4,500 feet to 7,500 feet. The reservoirs in these
    formations are largely carbonates, limestones and dolomites.


 


    At December 31, 2010, we had 210,666 gross (65,855
    net) acres in this area. In addition, at December 31, 2010,
    we had identified 1,800 (893 net) drilling locations, with
    proved undeveloped reserves attributed to 1,094 (502 net) of
    such drilling locations.


 


    During 2010, we commenced drilling or participated in the
    drilling of 313 (162 net) wells in this area, of which 225 (118
    net) wells were completed as producers, 1 (0.25 net) well was
    unsuccessful and 87 (44 net) wells were in various stages of
    drilling and completion at December 31, 2010.


 



    Other


 


    We are involved in other areas in which we had 7.9 MMBoe of
    proved reserves at December 31, 2010. The significant other
    area we are involved is the Bakken/Three Forks Play.


 


    At December 31, 2010, we held interests in
    90,914 gross (46,221 net) acres in these areas. During
    2010, we commenced participation in the drilling of 54 (6 net)
    wells, which 43 (5 net) wells were producing and 11 (1 net)
    wells were in various stages of drilling and completion at
    December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, we had
    7.9 MMBoe of proved reserves in these other areas. At
    December 31, 2010, on our properties in these areas, we had
    identified 455 (54 net) drilling locations with proved
    undeveloped reserves associated with 121 (14 net) of these
    drilling locations.


 


    Bakken/Three Forks play.  Our acreage in
    the Bakken/Three Forks play is in the Williston Basin in
    North Dakota, primarily in Mountrail and McKenzie Counties
    and represents 42,130 gross (11,180 net) acres which are
    included in the 90,914 gross (46,221 net) acres discussed
    above. These Mississippian/Devonian age horizons consist of
    siltstones encased within and below a highly organic oil-rich
    shale package. These horizons are found at vertical depths
    ranging from 9,000 feet to 11,000 feet and are being
    developed utilizing horizontal drilling techniques and advanced
    fracture and stimulation technology.

    Our
    Production, Prices and Expenses


 


    The following table sets forth summary information concerning
    our production and operating data from continuing operations for
    the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. The table
    below excludes production and operating data that we have
    classified as discontinued operations, which is more fully
    described in Note O of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements
    and Supplementary Data.” The actual historical data in this
    table excludes results from the (i) Marbob and Settlement
    Acquisitions for periods prior to their respective close dates
    in October 2010, (ii) Wolfberry Acquisitions for periods
    prior to 2010 and (iii) Henry Properties acquisition for
    periods prior to August 2008. Because of normal production
    declines, increased or decreased drilling activities and the
    effects of acquisitions or divestitures, the historical
    information presented below should not be interpreted as being
    indicative of future results.

    The presentation of average prices with derivatives is a
    non-GAAP measure as a result of including the cash payments
    on/receipts from commodity derivatives that are presented in
    gain (loss) on derivatives not designated as hedges in the
    statements of operations. This presentation of average prices
    with derivatives is a means by which to reflect the actual cash
    performance of our commodity derivatives for the respective
    periods and presents oil and natural gas prices with derivatives
    in a manner consistent with the presentation generally used by
    the investment community.

    Marketing
    Arrangements


 


    General.  We market our oil and natural
    gas in accordance with standard energy practices utilizing
    certain of our employees and external consultants, in each case
    in consultation with our products group, asset managers and our
    corporate reservoir engineers. The marketing effort is
    coordinated with our operations group as it relates to the
    planning and preparation of future drilling programs so that
    available markets can be assessed and secured. This planning
    also involves the coordination of procuring the physical
    facilities necessary to connect new producing wells as
    efficiently as possible upon their completion.


 


    Oil.  We do not transport, refine or
    process the oil we produce. A significant portion of our oil in
    Southeast New Mexico is connected directly to oil gathering
    pipelines. Most of our gathered oil in this area is utilized in
    a two-refinery complex in Southeast New Mexico. In 2010, we
    placed a significant portion of our West Texas production on
    pipeline. Most of this production is sweet crude and is
    transported by third parties to the Cushing, Oklahoma hub. The
    balance of our oil in these areas that is not directly connected
    to pipeline is trucked to unloading stations on those same
    pipelines. We sell the majority of the oil we produce under
    contracts using market-based pricing. This price is then
    adjusted for differentials based upon delivery location and oil
    quality.


 


    Natural Gas.  We consider all natural
    gas gathering and delivery infrastructure in the areas of our
    production and evaluate market options to obtain the best price
    reasonably available under the circumstances. We sell the
    majority of our natural gas under individually negotiated
    natural gas purchase contracts using market-based pricing.





    
    10



Table of Contents





    The majority of our natural gas is subject to term agreements
    that extend at least three years from the date of the subject
    contract.


 


    The majority of the natural gas we sell is casinghead gas sold
    at the lease under a percentage of proceeds processing contract.
    The purchaser gathers our casinghead natural gas in the field
    where it is produced and transports it via pipeline to a natural
    gas processing plant where the natural gas liquid products are
    extracted and sold by the processor. The remaining natural gas
    product is residue gas, or dry gas, which is placed on residue
    pipeline systems available in the area. Under our percentage of
    proceeds contracts, we receive a percentage of the value for the
    extracted liquids and the residue gas. Each of the liquid
    products has its own individual market and is therefore priced
    separately.


 


    In a limited number of cases (typically dry gas production), the
    natural gas gathering and transportation is performed by a third
    party gathering company which transports the production from the
    production location to the purchaser’s mainline. The
    majority of our dry gas and residue gas is subject to term
    agreements that extend at least three years from the date of the
    subject contract.



 



    Our
    Principal Customers


 


    We sell our oil and natural gas production principally to
    marketers and other purchasers that have access to pipeline
    facilities. In areas where there is no practical access to
    pipelines, oil is transported to storage facilities by trucks
    owned or otherwise arranged by the marketers or purchasers. Our
    marketing of oil and natural gas can be affected by factors
    beyond our control, the effects of which cannot be accurately
    predicted.


 


    For 2010, revenues from oil and natural gas sales to Navajo
    Refining Company, L.P., ConocoPhillips Company, DCP Midstream,
    LP and Plains Marketing and Transportation Inc. accounted for
    approximately 32 percent, 14 percent, 12 percent
    and 11 percent, respectively, of our total operating
    revenues. While the loss of any of these purchasers may result
    in a temporary interruption in sales of, or a lower price for,
    our production, we believe that the loss of any of these
    purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on our
    operations, as there are alternative purchasers in our producing
    regions.



 



    Competition


 


    The oil and natural gas industry in the regions in which we
    operate is highly competitive. We encounter strong competition
    from numerous parties, ranging generally from small independent
    producers to major integrated companies. We primarily encounter
    significant competition in acquiring properties, contracting for
    drilling and workover equipment and securing trained personnel.
    Many of these competitors have financial and technical resources
    and staffs substantially larger than ours. As a result, our
    competitors may be able to pay more for desirable properties, or
    to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties
    or prospects than our financial or personnel resources will
    permit.


 


    In addition to the competition for drilling and workover
    equipment we are also affected by the availability of related
    equipment and materials. The oil and natural gas industry
    periodically experiences shortages of drilling and workover
    rigs, equipment, pipe, materials and personnel, which can delay
    developmental drilling, workover and exploration activities and
    cause significant price increases. The past shortages of
    personnel made it difficult to attract and retain personnel with
    experience in the oil and natural gas industry and caused us to
    increase our general and administrative budget. We are unable to
    predict the timing or duration of any such shortages.


 


    Competition is also strong for attractive oil and natural gas
    producing properties, undeveloped leases and drilling rights.
    Although we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities and
    submit bids as part of our growth strategy, we do not have any
    current agreements, understandings or arrangements with respect
    to any material acquisition.

    Applicable
    Laws and Regulations


 



    Regulation
    of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry


 


    Regulation of transportation of
    oil.  Sales of oil, condensate and natural gas
    liquids are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated
    prices. Nevertheless, Congress could reenact price controls in
    the future.


 


    Our sales of oil are affected by the availability, terms and
    cost of transportation. The transportation of oil in common
    carrier pipelines is also subject to rate regulation. The
    Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the “FERC”)
    regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the
    Interstate Commerce Act. In general, interstate oil pipeline
    rates must be cost-based, although settlement rates agreed to by
    all shippers are permitted and market-based rates may be
    permitted in certain circumstances. Effective January 1,
    1995, the FERC implemented regulations establishing an indexing
    system that permits a pipeline, subject to limited challenges,
    to annually increase or decrease its transportation rates due to
    inflationary changes in costs using a FERC approved index,
    without making a cost of service filing. Every five years, the
    FERC reviews the appropriateness of the index in relation to
    industry costs. On March 21, 2006, FERC issued a decision
    setting the index for the period July 1, 2006 through
    July 1, 2011 at the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods
    (the “PPI-FG”) plus 1.3 percent. Most recently,
    on December 16, 2010, the FERC established a new price
    index of PPI-FG plus 2.65 percent for the five-year period
    beginning July 1, 2011. The basis for intrastate oil
    pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and
    scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates, varies from
    state to state. Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate
    rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we
    believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not
    affect our operations in any way that is of material difference
    from those of our competitors.


 


    Further, interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines
    must provide service on a non-discriminatory basis at posted
    tariff rates. When oil pipelines operate at full capacity,
    access is governed by prorationing provisions set forth in the
    pipelines’ published tariffs. Accordingly, we believe that
    access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be
    available to us to the same extent as to our competitors.


 


    Effective November 4, 2009, pursuant to the Energy
    Independence and Security Act of 2007, the Federal Trade
    Commission (“FTC”) issued a rule prohibiting market
    manipulation in the petroleum industry. The FTC rule prohibits
    any person, directly or indirectly, in connection with the
    purchase or sale of oil, gasoline or petroleum distillates at
    wholesale from knowingly engaging in any act, practice or course
    of business, including the making of any untrue statement of
    material fact, that operates or would operate as a fraud or
    deceit upon any person, or intentionally failing to state a
    material fact that under the circumstances renders a statement
    made by such person misleading, provided that such omission
    distorts or is likely to distort market conditions for any such
    product. A violation of this rule may result in civil penalties
    of up to $1 million per day per violation, in addition to
    any applicable penalty under the Federal Trade Commission Act.


 


    Regulation of transportation and sale of natural
    gas.  Historically, the transportation and
    sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce have been
    regulated pursuant to the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (the
    “Natural Gas Act”), the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978
    (the “Natural Gas Policy Act”) and regulations issued
    under those acts by the FERC. In the past, the federal
    government has regulated the prices at which natural gas could
    be sold. While sales by producers of natural gas can currently
    be made at uncontrolled market prices, Congress could reenact
    price controls in the future, and market participants are
    prohibited from engaging in market manipulation. Deregulation of
    wellhead natural gas sales began with the enactment of the
    Natural Gas Policy Act. In 1989, Congress enacted the Natural
    Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act which removed all Natural Gas Act and
    Natural Gas Policy Act price and non-price controls affecting
    wellhead sales of natural gas effective January 1, 1993.


 


    The FERC regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates
    and service conditions, which affects the marketing of natural
    gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for
    sales of our natural gas. Since 1985, the FERC has endeavored to
    make natural gas transportation more accessible to natural gas
    buyers and sellers on an open and non-discriminatory basis. The
    FERC has stated that open access policies are necessary to
    improve the competitive structure of the interstate natural gas
    pipeline industry and to create a regulatory framework that will
    put natural gas sellers into more direct contractual relations
    with natural gas buyers by, among other things, unbundling the
    sale of natural gas from the sale of transportation and storage
    services. Beginning in 1992, the FERC issued Order No. 636
    and a series of related orders to implement its open access
    policies. As a result of the Order





    
    12



Table of Contents





    No. 636 program, the marketing and pricing of natural gas
    have been significantly altered. The interstate pipelines’
    traditional role as wholesalers of natural gas has been
    eliminated and replaced by a structure under which pipelines
    provide transportation and storage service on an open access
    basis to others who buy and sell natural gas. Although these
    orders do not directly regulate natural gas producers, they are
    intended to foster increased competition within all phases of
    the natural gas industry.


 


    In 2000, the FERC issued Order No. 637 and subsequent
    orders, which imposed a number of additional reforms designed to
    enhance competition in natural gas markets. Among other things,
    Order No. 637 effected changes in FERC regulations relating
    to scheduling procedures, capacity segmentation, penalties,
    rights of first refusal and information reporting.


 


    In August 2005, Congress enacted the Energy Policy Act of 2005
    (the “EPAct 2005”). Among other matters, EPAct 2005
    amends the Natural Gas Act to make it unlawful for “any
    entity”, including otherwise non-jurisdictional producers
    such as us, to use any deceptive or manipulative device or
    contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of natural
    gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject
    to regulation by the FERC, in contravention of rules prescribed
    by the FERC. The FERC’s rules implementing this provision
    make it unlawful, in connection with the purchase or sale of
    natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, or the
    purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the
    jurisdiction of the FERC, for any entity, directly or
    indirectly, to use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to
    defraud; to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit
    to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made
    not misleading; or to engage in any act or practice that
    operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. EPAct 2005 also
    gives the FERC authority to impose civil penalties for
    violations of the Natural Gas Act or Natural Gas Policy Act up
    to $1 million per day per violation. The new
    anti-manipulation rule does not apply to activities that relate
    only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales, gathering
    or production, but does apply to activities of otherwise
    non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are
    conducted “in connection with” natural gas sales,
    purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction, which
    now includes the annual reporting requirements under Order
    No. 704, described below. EPAct 2005 therefore reflects a
    significant expansion of the FERC’s enforcement authority.
    We do not anticipate we will be affected any differently than
    other producers of natural gas.


 


    In December 2007, the FERC issued a rule (“Order
    No. 704”), as clarified in orders on rehearing,
    requiring that any market participant, including a producer such
    as us, that engages in wholesale sales or purchases of natural
    gas that equal or exceed 2.2 million MMBtus during a
    calendar year to annually report, starting May 1, 2009,
    such sales and purchases to the FERC. These rules are intended
    to increase the transparency of the wholesale natural gas
    markets and to assist the FERC in monitoring such markets and in
    detecting market manipulation. We do not anticipate that we will
    be affected by these rules any differently than other producers
    of natural gas.


 


    We cannot accurately predict whether the FERC’s actions
    will achieve the goal of increasing competition in markets in
    which our natural gas is sold. Additional proposals and
    proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are
    pending before the FERC and the courts. The natural gas industry
    historically has been very heavily regulated. Therefore, we
    cannot provide any assurance that the less stringent regulatory
    approach recently established by the FERC will continue.
    However, we do not believe that any action taken will affect us
    in a way that materially differs from the way it affects other
    natural gas producers.


 


    Gathering service, which occurs upstream of jurisdictional
    transmission services, is regulated by the states onshore and in
    state waters. Although its policy is still in flux, the FERC has
    reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as
    non-jurisdictional gathering facilities, which has the tendency
    to increase our costs of getting natural gas to point of sale
    locations.


 


    Intrastate natural gas transportation is also subject to
    regulation by state regulatory agencies. The basis for
    intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the
    degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate
    natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to
    state. During the 2007 legislative session, the Texas State
    Legislature passed H.B. 3273 (the “Competition Bill”)
    and H.B. 1920 (the “LUG Bill”). The Competition Bill
    gives the Railroad Commission of Texas the ability to use either
    a
    cost-of-service
    method or a market-based method for setting rates for natural
    gas gathering and intrastate transportation pipelines in formal
    rate proceedings. It also gives the Railroad Commission specific
    authority to enforce its statutory duty to prevent
    discrimination in natural gas gathering and transportation, to
    enforce the requirement that parties participate in an





    
    13



Table of Contents





    informal complaint process and to punish purchasers,
    transporters, and gatherers for taking discriminatory actions
    against shippers and sellers. The Competition Bill also provides
    producers with the unilateral option to determine whether or not
    confidentiality provisions are included in a contract to which a
    producer is a party for the sale, transportation, or gathering
    of natural gas. The LUG Bill modifies the informal complaint
    process at the Railroad Commission with procedures unique to
    lost and unaccounted for natural gas issues. It extends the
    types of information that can be requested, provides producers
    with an annual audit right, and provides the Railroad Commission
    with the authority to make determinations and issue orders in
    specific situations. Both the Competition Bill and the LUG Bill
    became effective September 1, 2007, and the Railroad
    Commission rules implementing the Railroad Commission’s
    authority pursuant to the bills became effective on
    April 28, 2008. We note that the Railroad Commission is
    subject to a sunset condition. If the Texas Legislature does not
    continue the Railroad Commission, the Railroad Commission will
    be abolished effective September 1, 2011, and will begin a
    one-year wind-down process. The Sunset Advisory Commission has
    recommended certain organizational changes be made to the
    Railroad Commission. We cannot tell what, if any, changes will
    be made to the Railroad Commission as a result of the pending
    regular session or any called sessions of the Texas Legislature
    in 2011, but we do not believe that any such changes would
    affect our business in a way that would be materially different
    from the way such changes would affect our competitors.


 


    Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will
    generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers within the
    state on a comparable basis, we believe that the regulation of
    similarly situated intrastate natural gas transportation in any
    states in which we operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate
    basis will not affect our operations in any way that is of
    material difference from those of our competitors. Like the
    regulation of interstate transportation rates, the regulation of
    intrastate transportation rates affects the marketing of natural
    gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for
    sales of our natural gas.


 


    Regulation of production.  The
    production of oil and natural gas is subject to regulation under
    a wide range of local, state and federal statutes, rules, orders
    and regulations. Federal, state and local statutes and
    regulations require permits for drilling operations, drilling
    bonds and reports concerning operations. All of the states in
    which we own and operate properties have regulations governing
    conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization
    or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment
    of maximum allowable rates of production from oil and natural
    gas wells, the regulation of well spacing, and the plugging and
    abandonment of wells. The effect of these regulations is to
    limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from
    our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at
    which we can drill, although we can apply for exceptions to such
    regulations or to have reductions in well spacing. Moreover,
    each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with
    respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and
    natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction. The failure to
    comply with these rules and regulations can result in
    substantial penalties. Our competitors in the oil and natural
    gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and
    restrictions that affect our operations.


 



    Environmental,
    Health and Safety Matters


 


    General.  Our operations are subject to
    stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and
    regulations governing environmental protection as well as the
    discharge of materials into the environment. These laws and
    regulations may, among other things:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    require the acquisition of various permits before drilling
    commences;




 



     
        • 

    
    restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various
    substances that can be released into the environment in
    connection with oil and natural gas drilling and production and
    saltwater disposal activities;




 



     
        • 

    
    limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying
    within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; and




 



     
        • 

    
    require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and
    ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug
    abandoned wells.





 


    These laws, rules and regulations may also restrict the rate of
    oil and natural gas production below the rate that would
    otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden on the oil and
    natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the
    industry and consequently affects profitability. Additionally,
    environmental laws and regulations are





    
    14



Table of Contents





    revised frequently, and any changes that result in more
    stringent and costly waste handling, disposal and cleanup
    requirements for the oil and natural gas industry could have a
    significant impact on our operating costs.


 


    The following is a summary of some of the existing laws, rules
    and regulations to which our business is subject.


 


    Waste handling.  The Resource
    Conservation and Recovery Act (the “RCRA”) and
    comparable state statutes, regulate the generation,
    transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of
    hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Under the auspices of the
    federal Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”),
    the individual states administer some or all of the provisions
    of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent
    requirements. Drilling fluids, produced waters, and most of the
    other wastes associated with the exploration, development, and
    production of oil or natural gas are currently regulated under
    RCRA’s non-hazardous waste provisions. However, it is
    possible that certain oil and natural gas exploration and
    production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be
    classified as hazardous wastes in the future. Any such change
    could result in an increase in our costs to manage and dispose
    of wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on our
    results of operations and financial position.


 


    Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
    Liability Act.  The Comprehensive
    Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (the
    “CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, imposes
    joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality
    of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be
    responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the
    environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the
    site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed or
    arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at
    the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and
    several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous
    substances that have been released into the environment, for
    damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health
    studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring
    landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal
    injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous
    substances released into the environment.


 


    We currently own, lease, or operate numerous properties that
    have been used for oil and natural gas exploration and
    production for many years. Although we believe that we have
    utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were
    standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances,
    wastes, or hydrocarbons may have been released on or under the
    properties owned or leased by us, or on or under other
    locations, including off-site locations, where such substances
    have been taken for disposal. In addition, some of our
    properties have been operated by third parties or by previous
    owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous
    substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons was not under our control.
    These properties and the substances disposed or released on them
    may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA, and analogous state laws. Under
    such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed
    substances and wastes, remediate contaminated property, or
    perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination.


 


    Water discharges.  The federal Water
    Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”) and
    analogous state laws, impose restrictions and strict controls
    with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills
    and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United
    States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is
    prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit
    issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. Federal and
    state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and
    criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or
    other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state
    laws and regulations.


 


    Air emissions.  The federal Clean Air
    Act, and comparable state laws, regulate emissions of various
    air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the
    imposition of other requirements. In addition, the EPA has
    developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations
    governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified
    sources. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose
    administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance
    with air permits or other requirements of the federal Clean Air
    Act and associated state laws and regulations.


 


    Climate change.  In December 2009 EPA
    determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other
    “greenhouse gases”, or GHGs, present an endangerment
    to public health and the environment because emissions of such
    gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the
    earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on
    these findings, the EPA has begun adopting and implementing
    regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs





    
    15



Table of Contents





    under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act
    (“CAA”). The EPA recently adopted two sets of rules
    regulating GHG emissions under the CAA, one of which requires a
    reduction in emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and the other
    of which regulates emissions of GHGs from certain large
    stationary sources, effective January 2, 2011. The
    EPA’s rules relating to emissions of GHGs from large
    stationary sources of emissions are currently subject to a
    number of legal challenges, but the federal courts have thus far
    declined to issue any injunctions to prevent EPA from
    implementing, or requiring state environmental agencies to
    implement, the rules. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring
    the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission
    sources in the United States, including petroleum refineries, on
    an annual basis beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring after
    January 1, 2010, as well as certain onshore oil and natural
    gas facilities, on an annual basis beginning in 2012 for
    emissions occurring in 2011.


 


    In addition, Congress has from time to time considered adopting
    legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs and almost one-half of
    the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions
    of GHGs gases primarily through the planned development of GHG
    emission inventories
    and/or
    regional GHG cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade
    programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, such as
    electric power plants, or major producers of fuels, such as
    refineries and natural gas processing plants, to acquire and
    surrender emission allowances. The number of allowances
    available for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to
    achieve the overall GHG emission reduction goal.


 


    The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce
    emissions of GHGs could require us to incur increased operating
    costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control
    systems, to acquire emissions allowances, or to comply with new
    regulatory or reporting requirements. Any such legislation or
    regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming,
    and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas we
    produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to
    reduce emissions of GHGs could have an adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition and results of operations.
    Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded
    that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the earth’s
    atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant
    physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of
    storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events. If any
    such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on
    our financial condition and results of operations.


 


    Hydraulic fracturing.  Hydraulic
    fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to
    stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations. We
    routinely utilize hydraulic fracturing techniques in many of our
    drilling and completion programs. The process involves the
    injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the
    formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate
    production. The process is typically regulated by state oil and
    natural gas commissions. However, the EPA recently asserted
    federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving
    diesel additives under the Safe Drinking Water Act’s
    Underground Injection Control Program. While the EPA has yet to
    take any action to enforce or implement this newly asserted
    regulatory authority, industry groups have filed suit
    challenging the EPA’s recent decision. At the same time,
    the EPA has commenced a study of the potential environmental
    impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities, and a committee of
    the United States House of Representatives is also conducting an
    investigation of hydraulic fracturing practices. Legislation has
    been introduced before Congress to provide for federal
    regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of
    the chemicals used in the fracturing process. In addition, some
    states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting,
    regulations that could impose more stringent permitting,
    disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic
    fracturing operations. For example, Colorado, Pennsylvania, and
    Wyoming have each adopted a variety of well construction, set
    back, and disclosure regulations limiting how fracturing can be
    performed and requiring various degrees of chemical disclosure.
    If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic
    fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult
    or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production
    from tight formations. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing
    becomes regulated at the federal level as a result of federal
    legislation or regulatory initiatives by the EPA, our fracturing
    activities could become subject to additional permitting
    requirements, and also to attendant permitting delays and
    potential increases in costs. Restrictions on hydraulic
    fracturing could also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas
    that we are ultimately able to produce from our reserves.


 


    Endangered species.  The federal
    Endangered Species Act and analogous state laws regulate
    activities that could have an adverse effect on threatened or
    endangered species. Some of our well drilling operations are





    
    16



Table of Contents





    conducted in areas where protected species are known to exist.
    In these areas, we may be obligated to develop and implement
    plans to avoid potential adverse impacts to protected species,
    and we may be prohibited from conducting drilling operations in
    certain locations or during certain seasons, such as breeding
    and nesting seasons, when our operations could have an adverse
    effect on the species. It is also possible that a federal or
    state agency could order a complete halt to drilling activities
    in certain locations if it is determined that such activities
    may have a serious adverse effect on a protected species. The
    presence of a protected species in areas where we perform
    drilling activities could impair our ability to timely complete
    well drilling and development and could adversely affect our
    future production from those areas.


 


    National Environmental Policy Act.  Oil
    and natural gas exploration and production activities on federal
    lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (the
    “NEPA”). NEPA requires federal agencies, including the
    Department of Interior, to evaluate major agency actions having
    the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the
    course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an
    environmental assessment that assesses the potential direct,
    indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if
    necessary, will prepare a more detailed environmental impact
    statement that may be made available for public review and
    comment. All of our current exploration and production
    activities, as well as proposed exploration and development
    plans, on federal lands require governmental permits that are
    subject to the requirements of NEPA. This process has the
    potential to delay development of some of our oil and natural
    gas projects.


 


    OSHA and other laws and regulation.  We
    are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational
    Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”), and comparable state
    statutes. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA
    community
    right-to-know
    regulations under the Title III of CERCLA and similar state
    statutes require that we organize
    and/or
    disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced
    in our operations. Also, pursuant to OSHA, the Occupational
    Safety and Health Administration has established a variety of
    standards relating to workplace exposure to hazardous substances
    and employee health and safety. We believe that we are in
    substantial compliance with the applicable requirements of OSHA
    and comparable laws.


 


    We believe that we are in substantial compliance with existing
    environmental laws and regulations applicable to our current
    operations and that our continued compliance with existing
    requirements will not have a material adverse impact on our
    financial condition and results of operations. For instance, we
    did not incur any material capital expenditures for remediation
    or pollution control activities during 2010. Additionally, as of
    the date of this report, we are not aware of any environmental
    issues or claims that will require material capital expenditures
    during 2011. However, we cannot assure you that the passage or
    application of more stringent laws or regulations in the future
    will not have an negative impact on our financial position or
    results of operation.



 



    Our
    Employees


 


    At December 31, 2010, we employed 443 persons. Of
    these, 332 worked at our Midland, Texas headquarters and our
    Texas field operations and 111 in our New Mexico field
    operations. Our future success will depend partially on our
    ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. We
    are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and have
    not experienced any strikes or work stoppages. We consider our
    relations with our employees to be good. We also utilize the
    services of independent contractors to perform various field and
    other services.

    Non-GAAP Financial
    Measures and Reconciliations


 



    PV-10


 


    PV-10 is
    derived from the standardized measure of discounted future net
    cash flows, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial
    measure.
    PV-10 is a
    computation of the standardized measure of discounted future net
    cash flows on a pre-tax basis.
    PV-10 is
    equal to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash
    flows at the applicable date, before deducting future income
    taxes, discounted at 10 percent. We believe that the
    presentation of the
    PV-10 is
    relevant and useful to investors because it presents the
    discounted future net cash flows attributable to our estimated
    proved reserves prior to taking into account future corporate
    income taxes, and it is a useful measure for evaluating the
    relative monetary significance of our oil and natural gas
    assets. Further, investors may utilize the measure as a basis
    for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to
    other companies. We use this measure when assessing the
    potential return on investment related to our oil and natural
    gas assets.
    PV-10,
    however, is not a substitute for the standardized measure of
    discounted future net cash flows. Our
    PV-10
    measure and the standardized measure of discounted future net
    cash flows do not purport to present the fair value of our oil
    and natural gas reserves.


 


    The following table provides a reconciliation of
    PV-10 to the
    standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows at
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008:

    EBITDAX


 


    We define EBITDAX as net income (loss), plus
    (1) exploration and abandonments expense,
    (2) depreciation, depletion and amortization expense,
    (3) accretion expense, (4) impairments of long-lived
    assets, (5) non-cash stock-based compensation expense,
    (6) bad debt expense, (7) ineffective portion of cash
    flow hedges, (8) unrealized (gain) loss on derivatives not
    designated as hedges, (9) (gain) loss on sale of assets, net,
    (10) interest expense, (11) federal and state income
    taxes and (12) similar items listed above that are
    presented in discontinued operations. EBITDAX is not a measure
    of net income or cash flow as determined by GAAP.


 


    Our EBITDAX measure provides additional information which may be
    used to better understand our operations, and it is also a
    material component of one of the financial covenants under our
    credit facility. EBITDAX is one of several metrics that we use
    as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of our
    business and should not be considered as an alternative to, or
    more meaningful than, net income, as an indicator of our
    operating performance. Certain items excluded from EBITDAX are
    significant components in understanding and assessing a
    company’s financial performance, such as a company’s
    cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic cost
    of depreciable and depletable assets. EBITDAX, as used by us,
    may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by
    other companies. We believe that EBITDAX is a widely followed
    measure of operating performance and is one of many metrics used
    by our management team and by other users of our consolidated
    financial statements, including by lenders pursuant to a
    covenant in our credit facility. For example, EBITDAX can be
    used to assess our operating performance and return on capital
    in comparison to other independent exploration and production
    companies without regard to financial or capital structure, and
    to assess the financial performance of our assets and our
    company without regard to capital structure or historical cost
    basis. Further, under our credit facility, an event of default
    could arise if we were not able to satisfy and remain in
    compliance with specified financial ratios, including the
    maintenance of a quarterly ratio of total debt to consolidated
    last twelve months EBITDAX of no greater than 4.0 to 1.0.
    Non-compliance with this ratio could trigger an event of default
    under our credit facility, which then could trigger an event of
    default under our indentures.

    Item 1A.  

    
    Risk
    Factors





 


    You should consider carefully the following risk factors
    together with all of the other information included in this
    report and other reports filed with the SEC, before investing in
    our shares. If any of the following risks were actually to
    occur, our business, financial condition or results of
    operations could be materially adversely affected. In that case,
    the trading price of our shares could decline and you could lose
    all or part of your investment.



 



    Risks
    Related to Our Business


 



    Oil
    and natural gas prices are volatile. A decline in oil and
    natural gas prices could adversely affect our financial
    position, financial results, cash flow, access to capital and
    ability to grow.


 


    Our future financial condition, revenues, results of operations,
    rate of growth and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas
    properties depend primarily upon the prices we receive for our
    oil and natural gas production and the prices prevailing from
    time to time for oil and natural gas. Oil and natural gas prices
    historically have been volatile, and are likely to continue to
    be volatile in the future, especially given current geopolitical
    conditions. This price volatility also affects the amount of
    cash flow we have available for capital expenditures and our
    ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. The prices
    for oil and natural gas are subject to a variety of factors
    beyond our control, including:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    the level of consumer demand for oil and natural gas;




 



     
        • 

    
    the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas;




 



     
        • 

    
    commodity processing, gathering and transportation availability,
    and the availability of refining capacity;




 



     
        • 

    
    the price and level of imports of foreign oil and natural gas;




 



     
        • 

    
    the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum
    Exporting Countries to agree to and maintain oil price and
    production controls;




 



     
        • 

    
    domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;




 



     
        • 

    
    the price and availability of alternative fuel sources;




 



     
        • 

    
    weather conditions;




 



     
        • 

    
    political conditions or hostilities in oil and natural gas
    producing regions, including the Middle East, Africa and South
    America;




 



     
        • 

    
    technological advances affecting energy consumption;




 



     
        • 

    
    variations between product prices at sales points and applicable
    index prices; and




 



     
        • 

    
    worldwide economic conditions.





 


    Furthermore, oil and natural gas prices were volatile in 2010.
    For example, the NYMEX oil prices in 2010 ranged from a high of
    $91.51 to a low of $68.01 per Bbl and the NYMEX natural gas
    prices in 2010 ranged from a high of $6.01 to a low of $3.29 per
    MMBtu. Further, the NYMEX oil prices and NYMEX natural gas
    prices reached lows of $84.32 per Bbl and $3.87 per MMBtu,
    respectively, during the period from January 1, 2011 to
    February 23, 2011.


 


    Declines in oil and natural gas prices would not only reduce our
    revenue, but could also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas
    that we can produce economically and, as a result, could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
    operations and reserves. If the oil and natural gas industry
    experiences significant price declines, we may, among other
    things, be unable to maintain or increase our borrowing
    capacity, repay current or future indebtedness or obtain
    additional capital on attractive terms, all of which can
    adversely affect the value of our common stock.

    Our
    estimates of proved reserves have been prepared under SEC rules
    which went into effect for fiscal years ending on or after
    December 31, 2009, which may make comparisons to prior to
    December 31, 2009 difficult and could limit our ability to book
    additional proved undeveloped reserves in the
    future.


 


    This report presents estimates of our proved reserves as of
    December 31, 2010, which have been prepared and presented
    under the recently changed SEC rules that are effective for
    fiscal years ending on or after December 31, 2009, and
    require SEC reporting companies to prepare their reserves
    estimates using revised reserve definitions and revised pricing
    based on a
    12-month
    unweighted average of the
    first-day-of-the-month
    pricing. The previous rules required that reserve estimates be
    calculated using
    last-day-of-the-year
    pricing. The pricing that was used for estimates of our reserves
    as of December 31, 2010 was based on an unweighted average
    twelve month West Texas Intermediate posted price of $75.96 per
    Bbl for oil and a Henry Hub spot natural gas price of $4.38 per
    MMBtu for natural gas. As a result of this change in pricing
    methodology, direct comparisons of our reported reserves amounts
    under the rules prior to December 31, 2009 may be more
    difficult.


 


    Another impact of the SEC rules is a general requirement that,
    subject to limited exceptions, proved undeveloped reserves may
    only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled
    within five years of the date of booking. This rule has limited
    and may continue to limit our potential to book additional
    proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue our drilling program,
    particularly as we develop our significant acreage in West Texas
    and Southeast New Mexico. Moreover, we may be required to write
    down our proved undeveloped reserves if we do not drill on those
    reserves within the required five-year timeframe.


 



    Drilling
    for and producing oil and natural gas are high-risk activities
    with many uncertainties that could cause our expenses to
    increase or our cash flows and production volumes to
    decrease.


 


    Our future financial condition and results of operations will
    depend on the success of our exploration, development and
    production activities. Our oil and natural gas exploration and
    production activities are subject to numerous risks, including
    the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable
    oil or natural gas production. Our decisions to purchase,
    explore, develop or otherwise exploit prospects or properties
    will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through
    geophysical and geological analyses, production data and
    engineering studies, the results of which are often inconclusive
    or subject to varying interpretations. Our cost of drilling,
    completing, equipping and operating wells is often uncertain
    before drilling commences. Overruns in budgeted expenditures are
    common risks that can make a particular project uneconomical or
    less economic than forecasted. Further, many factors may
    curtail, delay or cancel drilling, including the following:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory
    and contractual requirements;




 



     
        • 

    
    pressure or irregularities in geological formations;




 



     
        • 

    
    shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified
    personnel;




 



     
        • 

    
    equipment failures or accidents;




 



     
        • 

    
    adverse weather conditions;




 



     
        • 

    
    reductions in oil and natural gas prices;




 



     
        • 

    
    surface access restrictions;




 



     
        • 

    
    loss of title or other title related issues;




 



     
        • 

    
    oil, natural gas liquids or natural gas gathering,
    transportation and processing availability restrictions or
    limitations; and




 



     
        • 

    
    limitations in the market for oil and natural gas.

    Estimates
    of proved reserves and future net cash flows are not precise.
    The actual quantities of our proved reserves and our future net
    cash flows may prove to be lower than estimated.


 


    Numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved
    reserves and future net cash flows therefrom. Our estimates of
    proved reserves and related future net cash flows are based on
    various assumptions, which may ultimately prove to be inaccurate.


 


    Petroleum engineering is a subjective process of estimating
    accumulations of oil
    and/or
    natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner.
    Estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas
    reserves and of future net cash flows depend upon a number of
    variable factors and assumptions, including the following:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    historical production from the area compared with production
    from other producing areas;




 



     
        • 

    
    the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies;




 



     
        • 

    
    the quality, quantity and interpretation of available relevant
    data;




 



     
        • 

    
    assumptions concerning future commodity prices; and




 



     
        • 

    
    assumptions concerning future operating costs; severance, ad
    valorem and excise taxes; development costs; and workover and
    remedial costs.





 


    Because all reserve estimates are to some degree subjective,
    each of the following items, or other items not identified
    below, may differ materially from those assumed in estimating
    reserves:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately
    recovered;




 



     
        • 

    
    the production and operating costs incurred;




 



     
        • 

    
    the amount and timing of future development
    expenditures; and




 



     
        • 

    
    future commodity prices.





 


    Furthermore, different reserve engineers may make different
    estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same data. Our
    actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to
    reserves will likely be different from estimates and the
    differences may be material.


 



    The
    Standardized Measure of our estimated reserves is not an
    accurate estimate of the current fair value of our estimated
    proved oil and natural gas reserves.


 


    Standardized Measure is a reporting convention that provides a
    common basis for comparing oil and natural gas companies subject
    to the rules and regulations of the SEC. Our non-GAAP financial
    measure,
    PV-10, is a
    similar reporting convention that we have disclosed in this
    report. Both measures require the use of operating and
    development costs prevailing as of the date of computation.
    Consequently, they will not reflect the prices ordinarily
    received or that will be received for oil and natural gas
    production because of varying market conditions, nor may it
    reflect the actual costs that will be required to produce or
    develop the oil and natural gas properties. Accordingly,
    estimates included herein of future net cash flows may be
    materially different from the future net cash flows that are
    ultimately received. In addition, the 10 percent discount
    factor, which is required by the rules and regulations of the
    SEC to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows
    for reporting purposes, may not be the most appropriate discount
    factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and
    risks associated with our company or the oil and natural gas
    industry in general. Therefore, Standardized Measure or
    PV-10
    included or incorporated by reference in this report should not
    be construed as accurate estimates of the current fair value of
    our proved reserves. Any adjustments to the estimates of proved
    reserves or decreases in the price of oil or natural gas may
    decrease the value of our common stock.


 


    If average oil prices were $10.00 per Bbl lower than the average
    price we used, our
    PV-10 at
    December 31, 2010, would have decreased from
    $6,061.2 million to $5,182.5 million. If average
    natural gas prices were $1.00 per Mcf lower than the average
    price we used, our
    PV-10 at
    December 31, 2010, would have decreased from
    $6,061.2 million to $5,635.9 million. Any adjustments
    to the estimates of proved reserves or decreases in the price of
    oil or natural gas may decrease the value of our common stock.

    Our
    business requires substantial capital expenditures. We may be
    unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory
    terms or at all, which could lead to a decline in our oil and
    natural gas reserves.


 


    The oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive. We make
    and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures
    for the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and
    natural gas reserves. At December 31, 2010, total debt
    outstanding under our credit facility was $613.5 million
    (total debt at December 31, 2010 was $1.7 billion),
    and approximately $1.4 billion was available to be borrowed
    under our credit facility. Expenditures for exploration and
    development of oil and natural gas properties are the primary
    use of our capital resources. We incurred approximately
    $2.4 billion in acquisition, exploration and development
    activities (excluding asset retirement obligations) during the
    year ended December 31, 2010 on our properties
    ($1.7 billion related to acquisitions), and under our 2011
    capital budget, we intend to invest approximately
    $1.1 billion for exploration and development activities and
    acquisition of leasehold acreage, dependent on our cash flow and
    our commodity price outlook.


 


    We intend to finance our future capital expenditures, other than
    significant acquisitions, primarily through cash flow from
    operations and through borrowings under our credit facility;
    however, our financing needs may require us to alter or increase
    our capitalization substantially through the issuance of debt or
    equity securities. The issuance of additional equity securities
    could have a dilutive effect on the value of our common stock.
    Additional borrowings under our credit facility or the issuance
    of additional debt securities will require that a greater
    portion of our cash flow from operations be used for the payment
    of interest and principal on our debt, thereby reducing our
    ability to use cash flow to fund working capital, capital
    expenditures and acquisitions. In addition, our credit facility
    imposes certain limitations on our ability to incur additional
    indebtedness other than indebtedness under our credit facility.
    If we desire to issue additional debt securities other than as
    expressly permitted under our credit facility, we will be
    required to seek the consent of the lenders in accordance with
    the requirements of the facility, which consent may be withheld
    by the lenders under our credit facility in their discretion. If
    we incur certain additional indebtedness, our borrowing base
    under our credit facility may be reduced. Additional financing
    also may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. In the
    event additional capital resources are unavailable, we may
    curtail drilling, development and other activities or be forced
    to sell some of our assets on an untimely or unfavorable basis.


 


    Our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject
    to a number of variables, including:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    our proved reserves;




 



     
        • 

    
    the level of oil and natural gas we are able to produce from
    existing wells;




 



     
        • 

    
    the prices at which our oil and natural gas are sold;




 



     
        • 

    
    global credit and securities markets;




 



     
        • 

    
    the ability and willingness of lenders and investors to provide
    capital and the cost of the capital; and




 



     
        • 

    
    our ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves.





 


    If our revenues or the borrowing base under our credit facility
    decrease as a result of lower oil or natural gas prices,
    operating difficulties, declines in reserves, lending
    requirements or regulations, or for any other reason, we may
    have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain
    our operations at current levels. As a result, we may require
    additional capital to fund our operations, and we may not be
    able to obtain debt or equity financing to satisfy our capital
    requirements. If cash generated from operations or cash
    available under our credit facility is not sufficient to meet
    our capital requirements, the failure to obtain additional
    financing could result in a curtailment of our operations
    relating to the development of our prospects, which in turn
    could lead to a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves, and
    could adversely affect our production, revenues and results of
    operations.


 



    We
    have substantial indebtedness and may incur substantially more
    debt. Higher levels of indebtedness make us more vulnerable to
    economic downturns and adverse developments in our
    business.


 


    We have incurred debt amounting to approximately
    $1.7 billion at December 31, 2010. At
    December 31, 2010, the borrowing base under our credit
    facility was $2.0 billion, of which approximately
    $1.4 billion was available to be borrowed.




    
    23



Table of Contents





    As a result of our indebtedness, we will need to use a portion
    of our cash flow to pay interest, which will reduce the amount
    we will have available to finance our operations and other
    business activities and could limit our flexibility in planning
    for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in
    which we operate. Our indebtedness under our credit facility is
    at a variable interest rate, and so a rise in interest rates
    will generate greater interest expense to the extent we do not
    have applicable interest rate fluctuation hedges. The amount of
    our debt may also cause us to be more vulnerable to economic
    downturns and adverse developments in our business.


 


    We may incur substantially more debt in the future. The
    indentures governing certain of our outstanding senior notes
    contain restrictions on our incurrence of additional
    indebtedness. These restrictions, however, are subject to a
    number of qualifications and exceptions, and under certain
    circumstances, we could incur substantial additional
    indebtedness in compliance with these restrictions. Moreover,
    these restrictions do not prevent us from incurring obligations
    that do not constitute indebtedness under the indentures.


 


    Our ability to meet our debt obligations and other expenses will
    depend on our future performance, which will be affected by
    financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors,
    many of which we are unable to control. If our cash flow is not
    sufficient to service our debt, we may be required to refinance
    debt, sell assets or sell additional shares of common stock on
    terms that we may not find attractive if it may be done at all.
    Further, our failure to comply with the financial and other
    restrictive covenants relating to our indebtedness could result
    in a default under that indebtedness, which could adversely
    affect our business, financial condition and results of
    operations.


 



    We are
    subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and
    regulations that could adversely affect the cost, timing, manner
    or feasibility of conducting our operations.


 


    Our oil and natural gas exploration, development and production,
    and related saltwater disposal operations are subject to complex
    and stringent laws and regulations. In order to conduct our
    operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we
    must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and
    certificates from various federal, state, local and governmental
    authorities. We may incur substantial costs and experience
    delays in order to maintain compliance with these existing laws
    and regulations. In addition, our costs of compliance may
    increase or our operations may be otherwise adversely affected
    if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted,
    or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our
    operations. These and other costs could have a material adverse
    effect on our production, revenues and results of operations.


 


    Our business is subject to federal, state and local laws and
    regulations as interpreted and enforced by governmental
    authorities possessing jurisdiction over various aspects of the
    exploration for, and the production of, oil and natural gas.
    Failure to comply with such laws and regulations, as interpreted
    and enforced, could have a material adverse effect on our
    production, revenues and results of operations.


 



    Our
    operations expose us to significant costs and liabilities with
    respect to environmental and operational safety
    matters.


 


    We may incur significant delays, costs and liabilities as a
    result of environmental, health and safety requirements
    applicable to our oil and natural gas exploration, development
    and production, and related saltwater disposal activities. These
    delays, costs and liabilities could arise under a wide range of
    federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to
    protection of the environment, health and safety, including
    regulations and enforcement policies that have tended to become
    increasingly strict over time. Failure to comply with these laws
    and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative,
    civil and criminal penalties, imposition of cleanup and site
    restoration costs and liens, and, in some instances, issuance of
    orders or injunctions limiting or requiring discontinuation of
    certain operations. In addition, claims for damages to persons
    or property, including natural resources, may result from the
    environmental, health and safety impacts of our operations.


 


    Strict as well as joint and several liability for a variety of
    environmental costs may be imposed under certain environmental
    laws, which could cause us to become liable for the conduct of
    others or for consequences of our own actions that were in
    compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions
    were taken. New laws, regulations or enforcement policies could
    be more stringent and impose unforeseen liabilities or
    significantly increase





    
    24



Table of Contents





    compliance costs. If we were not able to recover the resulting
    costs through insurance or increased revenues, our production,
    revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected.


 



    We may
    not be able to obtain funding at all, or to obtain funding on
    acceptable terms, because of the deterioration of the credit and
    capital markets. This may hinder or prevent us from meeting our
    future capital needs and from refinancing our existing
    indebtedness.


 


    In recent years, global financial markets and economic
    conditions experienced disruptions and volatility, which caused
    a deterioration in the credit and capital markets. A recurrence
    of similar conditions in the future could make it difficult for
    us to obtain funding for our ongoing capital needs.


 


    In volatile financial markets, the cost of raising money in the
    debt and equity capital markets can fluctuate widely and the
    availability of funds from those markets may diminish
    significantly. Due to these factors, we cannot be certain that
    funding will be available if needed and to the extent required,
    on acceptable terms. In addition, we may be unable to refinance
    our existing indebtedness as it comes due on terms that are
    acceptable to us or at all. If we cannot meet our capital needs
    or refinance our existing indebtedness, we may be unable to
    implement our development plan, enhance our existing business,
    complete acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business
    opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which
    could have a material adverse effect on our production, revenues
    and results of operations.


 



    Our
    lenders can limit our borrowing capabilities, which may
    materially impact our operations.


 


    At December 31, 2010, we had approximately
    $613.5 million of outstanding debt under our credit
    facility, and our borrowing base was $2.0 billion. The
    borrowing base limitation under our credit facility is
    semi-annually redetermined based upon a number of factors,
    including commodity prices and reserve levels. In addition to
    such semi-annual redeterminations, between redeterminations we
    and, if requested by
    662/3 percent
    of our lenders, our lenders, may each request one special
    redetermination. Upon a redetermination, our borrowing base
    could be substantially reduced, and in the event the amount
    outstanding under our credit facility at any time exceeds the
    borrowing base at such time, we may be required to repay a
    portion of our outstanding borrowings. If we incur certain
    additional indebtedness, our borrowing base under our credit
    facility may be reduced. We expect to utilize cash flow from
    operations, bank borrowings, equity financings and asset sales
    to fund our acquisition, exploration and development activities.
    A reduction in our borrowing base could limit our activities. In
    addition, we may significantly alter our capitalization in order
    to make future acquisitions or develop our properties. These
    changes in capitalization may significantly increase our level
    of debt. If we incur additional debt for these or other
    purposes, the related risks that we now face could intensify. A
    higher level of debt also increases the risk that we may default
    on our debt obligations. Our ability to meet our debt
    obligations and to reduce our level of debt depends on our
    future performance which is affected by general economic
    conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of
    which are beyond our control.


 



    Our
    producing properties are located primarily in the Permian Basin
    of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas, making us vulnerable to
    risks associated with operating in one major geographic area. In
    addition, we have a large amount of proved reserves attributable
    to a small number of producing horizons within this
    area.


 


    Our producing properties in our core operating areas are
    geographically concentrated in the Permian Basin of Southeast
    New Mexico and West Texas. At December 31, 2010,
    approximately 97.5 percent of our proved reserves were
    attributable to properties located in this area. As a result of
    this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the
    impact of regional supply and demand factors, delays or
    interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by
    governmental regulation, processing or transportation capacity
    constraints, market limitations, or interruption of the
    processing or transportation of oil, natural gas or natural gas
    liquids.


 


    In addition to the geographic concentration of our producing
    properties described above, at December 31, 2010,
    approximately (i) 43.2 percent of our proved reserves
    were attributable to the Yeso formation, which includes both the
    Paddock and Blinebry intervals, underlying our oil and natural
    gas properties located in Southeast New Mexico; and
    (ii) 27.4 percent of our proved reserves were
    attributable to the Wolfberry play in West Texas. This





    
    25



Table of Contents





    concentration of assets within a small number of producing
    horizons exposes us to additional risks, such as changes in
    field-wide rules and regulations that could cause us to
    permanently or temporarily shut-in all of our wells within a
    field.


 



    Future
    price declines could result in a reduction in the carrying value
    of our proved oil and natural gas properties, which could
    adversely affect our results of operations.


 


    Declines in commodity prices may result in having to make
    substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved
    reserves. If this occurs, or if our estimates of production or
    economic factors change, accounting rules may require us to
    write-down, as a noncash charge to earnings, the carrying value
    of our proved oil and natural gas properties for impairments. We
    are required to perform impairment tests on proved assets
    whenever events or changes in circumstances warrant a review of
    our proved oil and natural gas properties. To the extent such
    tests indicate a reduction of the estimated useful life or
    estimated future cash flows of our oil and natural gas
    properties, the carrying value may not be recoverable and
    therefore require a write-down. We may incur impairment charges
    in the future, which could materially adversely affect our
    results of operations in the period incurred.


 



    We
    periodically evaluate our unproved oil and natural gas
    properties for impairment, and could be required to recognize
    noncash charges to earnings of future periods.


 


    At December 31, 2010, we carried unproved property costs of
    $633.9 million. GAAP requires periodic evaluation of these
    costs on a
    project-by-project
    basis in comparison to their estimated fair value. These
    evaluations will be affected by the results of exploration
    activities, commodity price circumstances, planned future sales
    or expiration of all or a portion of the leases, contracts and
    permits appurtenant to such projects. If the quantity of
    potential reserves determined by such evaluations is not
    sufficient to fully recover the cost invested in each project,
    we will recognize noncash charges to earnings of future periods.


 



    Part
    of our strategy involves exploratory drilling, including
    drilling in new or emerging plays. As a result, our drilling
    results in these areas are uncertain, and the value of our
    undeveloped acreage will decline if drilling results are
    unsuccessful.


 


    The results of our exploratory drilling in new or emerging plays
    are more uncertain than drilling results in areas that are
    developed and have established production. Since new or emerging
    plays and new formations have limited or no production history,
    we are unable to use past drilling results in those areas to
    help predict our future drilling results. As a result, our cost
    of drilling, completing and operating wells in these areas may
    be higher than initially expected, and the value of our
    undeveloped acreage will decline if drilling results are
    unsuccessful.


 



    Our
    commodity price risk management program may cause us to forego
    additional future profits or result in our making cash payments
    to our counterparties.


 


    To reduce our exposure to changes in the prices of oil and
    natural gas, we have entered into and may in the future enter
    into additional commodity price risk management arrangements for
    a portion of our oil and natural gas production. The agreements
    that we have entered into generally have the effect of providing
    us with a fixed price for a portion of our expected future oil
    and natural gas production over a fixed period of time.
    Commodity price risk management arrangements expose us to the
    risk of financial loss and may limit our ability to benefit from
    increases in oil and natural gas prices in some circumstances,
    including the following:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    the counterparty to a commodity price risk management contract
    may default on its contractual obligations to us;




 



     
        • 

    
    there may be a change in the expected differential between the
    underlying price in a commodity price risk management agreement
    and actual prices received; or




 



     
        • 

    
    market prices may exceed the prices which we are contracted to
    receive, resulting in our need to make significant cash payments
    to our counterparties.





 


    Our commodity price risk management activities could have the
    effect of reducing our revenues, net income and the value of our
    common stock. At December 31, 2010, the net unrealized loss
    on our commodity price risk





    
    26



Table of Contents





    management contracts was approximately $135 million. An
    average increase in the commodity price of $10.00 per barrel of
    oil and $1.00 per MMBtu for natural gas from the commodity
    prices at December 31, 2010, would have increased the net
    unrealized loss on our commodity price risk management
    contracts, as reflected on our balance sheet at
    December 31, 2010, by $208 million. We may continue to
    incur significant unrealized gains or losses in the future from
    our commodity price risk management activities to the extent
    market prices increase or decrease and our derivatives contracts
    remain in place.


 



    We
    have entered into interest rate derivative instruments that may
    subject us to loss of income.


 


    We have entered into derivative instruments designed to limit
    the interest rate risk under our current credit facility or any
    credit facilities we may enter into in the future. These
    derivative instruments can involve the exchange of a portion of
    our floating rate interest obligations for fixed rate interest
    obligations or a cap on our exposure to floating interest rates
    to reduce our exposure to the volatility of interest rates.
    While we may enter into instruments limiting our exposure to
    higher market interest rates, we cannot assure you that any
    interest rate derivative instruments we implement will be
    effective; and furthermore, even if effective these instruments
    may not offer complete protection from the risk of higher
    interest rates.


 


    All interest rate derivative instruments involve certain
    additional risks, such as:

    the counterparty may default on its contractual obligations to
    us;




 



     
        • 

    
    there may be issues with regard to the legal enforceability of
    such instruments;




 



     
        • 

    
    the early repayment of one of our interest rate derivative
    instruments could lead to prepayment penalties; or




 



     
        • 

    
    unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates may
    cause a significant loss of basis in the instrument and a change
    in current period expense.





 



    Our
    identified inventory of drilling locations and recompletion
    opportunities are scheduled out over several years, making them
    susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the
    occurrence or timing of their drilling.


 


    We have identified and scheduled the drilling of certain of our
    drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi-year
    development activities on our existing acreage. At
    December 31, 2010, we had identified 6,253 gross
    drilling locations with proved reserves attributable to 2,042 of
    such locations. These identified locations represent a
    significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill
    and develop these locations depends on a number of
    uncertainties, including (i) our ability to timely drill
    wells on lands subject to complex development terms and
    circumstances; (ii) the availability of capital, equipment,
    services and personnel; (iii) seasonal conditions;
    (iv) regulatory and third party approvals; (v) oil and
    natural gas prices; and (vi) drilling and recompletion
    costs and results. Because of these uncertainties, we may never
    drill the numerous potential locations we have identified or
    produce oil or natural gas from these or any other potential
    locations. As such, our actual development activities may
    materially differ from those presently identified, which could
    adversely affect our production, revenues and results of
    operations.


 



    Approximately
    43 percent of our total estimated proved reserves at
    December 31, 2010, were undeveloped, and those reserves may
    not ultimately be developed.


 


    At December 31, 2010, approximately 43 percent of our
    total estimated proved reserves were undeveloped. Recovery of
    undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures
    and successful drilling. Our reserve data assumes that we can
    and will make these expenditures and conduct these operations
    successfully. These assumptions, however, may not prove correct.
    Our reserve report at December 31, 2010 includes estimates
    of total future development costs over the next five years
    associated with our proved undeveloped reserves of approximately
    $1.7 billion. If we choose not to spend the capital to
    develop these reserves, or if we are not otherwise able to
    successfully develop these reserves, we will be required to
    write-off these reserves. In addition, under the SEC’s
    reserve rules, because proved undeveloped reserves may be booked
    only if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five
    years of the date of booking, we may be required to write off
    any proved undeveloped reserves





    
    27



Table of Contents





    that are not developed within this five year timeframe. Any such
    write-offs of our reserves could reduce our ability to borrow
    money and could reduce the value of our securities.


 



    Unless
    we replace our oil and natural gas reserves, our reserves and
    production will decline, which would adversely affect our cash
    flow, our ability to raise capital and the value of our common
    stock.


 


    Unless we conduct successful development and exploration
    activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our
    proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced.
    Producing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are
    characterized by declining production rates that vary depending
    upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Our future oil
    and natural gas reserves and production, and therefore our cash
    flow and results of operations, are highly dependent on our
    success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current
    reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional
    recoverable reserves. The value of our common stock and our
    ability to raise capital will be adversely impacted if we are
    not able to replace our reserves that are depleted by
    production. We may not be able to develop, exploit, find or
    acquire sufficient additional reserves to replace our current
    and future production.


 



    We may
    be unable to make attractive acquisitions or successfully
    integrate acquired companies, and any inability to do so may
    disrupt our business and hinder our ability to
    grow.


 


    One aspect of our business strategy calls for acquisitions of
    businesses or assets that complement or expand our current
    business. We may not be able to identify attractive acquisition
    opportunities. Even if we do identify attractive candidates, we
    may not be able to complete the acquisition of them or do so on
    commercially acceptable terms.


 


    In addition, our credit facility and the indentures governing
    certain of our senior notes impose certain limitations on our
    ability to enter into mergers or combination transactions. Our
    credit facility and the indentures governing certain of our
    senior notes also limit our ability to incur certain
    indebtedness, which could indirectly limit our ability to engage
    in acquisitions of businesses or assets. If we desire to engage
    in an acquisition that is otherwise prohibited by our credit
    facility or the indentures governing certain of our senior
    notes, we will be required to seek the consent of our lenders or
    the holders of the senior notes in accordance with the
    requirements of the facility or the indentures, which consent
    may be withheld by the lenders under our credit facility or such
    holders of senior notes in their sole discretion. Furthermore,
    given the current situation in the credit markets, many lenders
    are reluctant to provide consents in any circumstances,
    including to allow accretive transactions.


 


    If we acquire another business or assets, we could have
    difficulty integrating its operations, systems, management and
    other personnel and technology with our own. These difficulties
    could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and
    employees, increase our expenses and adversely affect our
    results of operations. In addition, we may incur additional debt
    or issue additional equity to pay for any future acquisitions,
    subject to the limitations described above.


 



    Our
    acquisitions may prove to be worth less than what we paid
    because of uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and
    could expose us to potentially significant
    liabilities.


 


    We obtained the majority of our current reserve base through
    acquisitions of producing properties and undeveloped acreage. We
    expect that acquisitions will continue to contribute to our
    future growth. In connection with these and potential future
    acquisitions, we are often only able to perform limited due
    diligence.


 


    Successful acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties
    require an assessment of a number of factors, including
    estimates of recoverable reserves, the timing of recovering
    reserves, exploration potential, future oil and natural gas
    prices, operating costs and potential environmental, regulatory
    and other liabilities. Such assessments are inexact, and we
    cannot make these assessments with a high degree of accuracy. In
    connection with our assessments, we perform a review of the
    acquired properties. However, such a review will not reveal all
    existing or potential problems. In addition, our review may not
    permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to
    fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities. We do not
    inspect every well. Even when we inspect a well, we do not
    always discover structural, subsurface and environmental
    problems that may exist or arise.




    
    28



Table of Contents





    There may be threatened, contemplated, asserted or other claims
    against the acquired assets related to environmental, title,
    regulatory, tax, contract, litigation or other matters of which
    we are unaware, which could materially and adversely affect our
    production, revenues and results of operations. We are sometimes
    able to obtain contractual indemnification for preclosing
    liabilities, including environmental liabilities, but we
    generally acquire interests in properties on an “as
    is” basis with limited remedies for breaches of
    representations and warranties. In addition, even when we are
    able to obtain such indemnification from the sellers, these
    indemnification obligations usually expire over time and expose
    us to potential unindemnified liabilities, which could
    materially adversely affect our production, revenues and results
    of operations.


 



    Competition
    in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, making it more
    difficult for us to acquire properties, market oil and natural
    gas and secure trained personnel.


 


    We operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring
    properties, marketing oil and natural gas and securing trained
    personnel. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial,
    technical and personnel resources substantially greater than
    ours, which can be particularly important in the areas in which
    we operate. Those companies may be able to pay more for
    productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory
    prospects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number
    of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel
    resources permit. In addition, those companies may be able to
    offer better compensation packages to attract and retain
    qualified personnel than we are able to offer. The cost to
    attract and retain qualified personnel has increased over the
    past few years due to competition and may increase substantially
    in the future. Our ability to acquire additional prospects and
    to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our
    ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to
    consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment.
    Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for
    investment in the oil and natural gas industry. We may not be
    able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring
    prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing
    hydrocarbons, attracting and retaining quality personnel and
    raising additional capital. Our failure to acquire properties,
    market oil and natural gas and secure trained personnel and
    adequately compensate personnel could have a material adverse
    effect on our production, revenues and results of operations.


 



    Shortages
    of oilfield equipment, services and qualified personnel could
    delay our drilling program and increase the prices we pay to
    obtain such equipment, services and personnel.


 


    The demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to
    drill wells and conduct field operations, geologists,
    geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and
    natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in
    correlation with oil and natural gas prices, causing periodic
    shortages. Historically, there have been shortages of drilling
    and workover rigs, pipe and other oilfield equipment as demand
    for rigs and equipment has increased along with the number of
    wells being drilled. These factors also cause significant
    increases in costs for equipment, services and personnel. Higher
    oil and natural gas prices generally stimulate demand and result
    in increased prices for drilling and workover rigs, crews and
    associated supplies, equipment and services. It is beyond our
    control and ability to predict whether these conditions will
    exist in the future and, if so, what their timing and duration
    will be. These types of shortages or price increases could
    significantly decrease our profit margin, cash flow and
    operating results, or restrict our ability to drill the wells
    and conduct the operations which we currently have planned and
    budgeted or which we may plan in the future.


 



    Our
    exploration and development drilling may not result in
    commercially productive reserves.


 


    Drilling activities are subject to many risks, including the
    risk that commercially productive reservoirs will not be
    encountered. New wells that we drill may not be productive, or
    we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in such
    wells. The seismic data and other technologies we use do not
    allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil
    or natural gas is present or may be produced economically.
    Drilling for oil and natural gas often involves unprofitable
    results, not only from dry holes but also from wells that are
    productive but do not produce sufficient net reserves to return
    a profit at then realized prices after deducting drilling,
    operating and other costs. The cost of drilling, completing and
    operating a well is often uncertain, and cost factors can
    adversely affect





    
    29



Table of Contents





    the economics of a project. Further, our drilling operations may
    be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous
    factors, including:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    unexpected drilling conditions;




 



     
        • 

    
    title problems;




 



     
        • 

    
    pressure or lost circulation in formations;




 



     
        • 

    
    equipment failures or accidents;




 



     
        • 

    
    adverse weather conditions;




 



     
        • 

    
    compliance with environmental and other governmental or
    contractual requirements; and




 



     
        • 

    
    increases in the cost of, or shortages or delays in the
    availability of, electricity, supplies, materials, drilling or
    workover rigs, equipment and services.





 



    We may
    incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability
    claims as a result of our oil and natural gas operations. In
    addition, we may not be insured for, or our insurance may be
    inadequate to protect us against, these risks.


 


    We are not insured against all risks. Losses and liabilities
    arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially
    and adversely affect our business, financial condition or
    results of operations. Our oil and natural gas exploration and
    production activities are subject to all of the operating risks
    associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas,
    including the possibility of:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    environmental hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of oil,
    natural gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas or other pollution
    into the environment, including groundwater contamination;




 



     
        • 

    
    abnormally pressured or structured formations;




 



     
        • 

    
    mechanical difficulties, such as stuck oilfield drilling and
    service tools and casing collapse;




 



     
        • 

    
    fires, explosions and ruptures of pipelines;




 



     
        • 

    
    personal injuries and death; and




 



     
        • 

    
    natural disasters.





 


    Any of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct
    operations or result in substantial losses to us as a result of:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    injury or loss of life;




 



     
        • 

    
    damage to and destruction of property, natural resources and
    equipment;




 



     
        • 

    
    pollution and other environmental damage;




 



     
        • 

    
    regulatory investigations and penalties;




 



     
        • 

    
    suspension of our operations; and




 



     
        • 

    
    repair and remediation costs.





 


    We may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost
    of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks
    presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks
    generally are not fully insurable. The occurrence of an event
    that is not covered or not fully covered by insurance could have
    a material adverse effect on our production, revenues and
    results of operations.

    Market
    conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to
    oil and natural gas markets or delay our
    production.


 


    Market conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory oil and
    natural gas processing or transportation arrangements may hinder
    our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our
    production. The availability of a ready market for our oil and
    natural gas production depends on a number of factors, including
    the demand for and supply of oil and natural gas, the proximity
    of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities, competition
    for such facilities and the inability of such facilities to
    gather, transport or process our production due to shutdowns or
    curtailments arising from mechanical, operational or weather
    related matters, including hurricanes and other severe weather
    conditions. Our ability to market our production depends in
    substantial part on the availability and capacity of gathering
    and transportation systems, pipelines and processing facilities
    owned and operated by third parties. Our failure to obtain such
    services on acceptable terms could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition and results of
    operations. We may be required to shut in or otherwise curtail
    production from wells due to lack of a market or inadequacy or
    unavailability of oil, natural gas liquids or natural gas
    pipeline or gathering, transportation or processing capacity. If
    that were to occur, then we would be unable to realize revenue
    from those wells until suitable arrangements were made to market
    our production.


 



    Certain
    federal income tax deductions currently available with respect
    to oil and natural gas exploration and development may be
    eliminated as a result of future legislation.


 


    President Obama’s budget proposal for the fiscal year 2012
    recommended the elimination of certain key United States federal
    income tax preferences currently available to oil and natural
    gas exploration and production companies. These changes include,
    but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage
    depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties,
    (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible
    drilling and development costs and (iii) the increase in
    the amortization period from two years to seven years for
    geophysical costs paid or incurred in connection with the
    exploration for, or development of, oil or natural gas within
    the United States.


 


    It is unclear whether any such changes will actually be enacted
    or, if enacted, how soon any such changes could become
    effective. The passage of any legislation as a result of the
    budget proposal or any other similar change in United States
    federal income tax law could affect certain tax deductions that
    are currently available with respect to oil and natural gas
    exploration and production.


 



    Climate
    change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of
    “greenhouse gases” could result in increased operating
    costs and reduced demand for the crude oil and natural gas that
    we produce.


 


    In December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of carbon
    dioxide, methane and other “greenhouse gases” present
    an endangerment to public health and the environment because
    emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing
    to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic
    changes. Based on these findings, the EPA has begun adopting and
    implementing regulations to restrict emissions of greenhouse
    gases under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act.
    The EPA recently adopted two sets of rules regulating greenhouse
    gas emissions under the Clean Air Act, one of which requires a
    reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles
    and the other of which regulates emissions of greenhouse gases
    from certain large stationary sources, effective January 2,
    2011. The EPA’s rules relating to emissions of greenhouse
    gases from large stationary sources of emissions are currently
    subject to a number of legal challenges, but the federal courts
    have thus far declined to issue any injunctions to prevent EPA
    from implementing, or requiring state environmental agencies to
    implement, the rules. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring
    the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large
    greenhouse gas emission sources in the United States, including
    petroleum refineries, on an annual basis, beginning in 2011 for
    emissions occurring after January 1, 2010, as well as
    certain onshore oil and natural gas production facilities, on an
    annual basis, beginning in 2012 for emissions occurring in 2011.


 


    In addition, Congress has from time to time considered adopting
    legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and almost
    one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to
    reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the
    planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories
    and/or
    regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Most of these
    cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of
    emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers of
    fuels, such as refineries and gas processing plants, to acquire
    and





    
    31



Table of Contents





    surrender emission allowances. The number of allowances
    available for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to
    achieve the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal.


 


    The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce
    emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur
    increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate
    emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or
    comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Any such
    legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost
    of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural
    gas we produced. Consequently, legislation and regulatory
    programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists
    have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse
    gases in the earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes
    that have significant physical effects, such as increased
    frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other
    climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could
    have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
    operations.


 



    The
    recent adoption of derivatives legislation by Congress could
    have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative
    instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest
    rate and other risks associated with our business.


 


    Congress recently adopted comprehensive financial reform
    legislation that establishes federal oversight and regulation of
    the
    over-the-counter
    derivatives market and entities, including us, that participate
    in that market. The new legislation, known as the Dodd-Frank
    Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the
    “Dodd-Frank Act”), was signed into law by the
    President on July 21, 2010 and requires the Commodities
    Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) and the SEC to
    promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new
    legislation within 360 days from the date of enactment. In
    its rulemaking under the Act, the CFTC has proposed regulations
    to set position limits for certain futures and option contracts
    in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their
    economic equivalents. Certain bona fide hedging
    transactions or positions would be exempt from these position
    limits. It is not possible at this time to predict when the CFTC
    will finalize these regulations. The financial reform
    legislation may also require us to comply with margin
    requirements and with certain clearing and trade-execution
    requirements in connection with our derivative activities,
    although the application of those provisions to us is uncertain
    at this time. The financial reform legislation may also require
    the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off
    some of their derivatives activities to a separate entity, which
    may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty. The new
    legislation and any new regulations could significantly increase
    the cost of derivative contracts (including through requirements
    to post collateral which could adversely affect our available
    liquidity), materially alter the terms of derivative contracts,
    reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks
    we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our
    existing derivative contracts, and increase our exposure to less
    creditworthy counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives
    as a result of the legislation and regulations, our results of
    operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be
    less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to
    plan for and fund capital expenditures. Finally, the legislation
    was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and
    natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to
    speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments
    related to oil and natural gas. Our revenues could therefore be
    adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and
    regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these
    consequences could have a material adverse effect on us, our
    financial condition and our results of operations.


 



    Federal
    and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to
    hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and
    additional operating restrictions or delays.


 


    Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is
    used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight
    formations. We routinely utilize hydraulic fracturing techniques
    in many of our drilling and completion programs. The process
    involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under
    pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and
    stimulate production. The process is typically regulated by
    state oil and gas commissions. However, the EPA recently
    asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing
    involving diesel additives under the Safe Drinking Water
    Act’s Underground Injection Control Program. While the EPA
    has yet to take any action to enforce or implement this newly
    asserted regulatory authority, industry groups have filed suit
    challenging the EPA’s recent decision. At the same time,
    the EPA has commenced a study of the potential





    
    32



Table of Contents





    environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities, and a
    committee of the United States House of Representatives is also
    conducting an investigation of hydraulic fracturing practices.
    Legislation has been introduced before Congress to provide for
    federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require
    disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. In
    addition, some states have adopted, and other states are
    considering adopting, regulations that could impose more
    stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction
    requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. For example,
    Colorado, Pennsylvania and Wyoming have each adopted a variety
    of well construction, set back, and disclosure regulations
    limiting how fracturing can be performed and requiring various
    degrees of chemical disclosure. If new laws or regulations that
    significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such
    laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform
    fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations. In
    addition, if hydraulic fracturing becomes regulated at the
    federal level as a result of federal legislation or regulatory
    initiatives by the EPA, our fracturing activities could become
    subject to additional permitting requirements, and also to
    attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs.
    Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could also reduce the
    amount of oil and natural gas that we are ultimately able to
    produce from our reserves.


 



    The
    loss of our chief executive officer or other key personnel could
    negatively impact our ability to execute our business
    strategy.


 


    We depend, and will continue to depend in the foreseeable
    future, on the services of our chief executive officer, Timothy
    A. Leach, and other officers and key employees who have
    extensive experience and expertise in evaluating and analyzing
    producing oil and natural gas properties and drilling prospects,
    maximizing production from oil and natural gas properties,
    marketing oil and natural gas production, and developing and
    executing acquisition, financing and hedging strategies. Our
    ability to hire and retain our officers and key employees is
    important to our continued success and growth. The unexpected
    loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could
    negatively impact our ability to execute our business strategy.


 



    Because
    we do not control the development of certain of the properties
    in which we own interests, but do not operate, we may not be
    able to achieve any production from these properties in a timely
    manner.


 


    At December 31, 2010, approximately 10.4 percent of
    our proved reserves were attributable to properties for which we
    were not the operator. As a result, the success and timing of
    drilling and development activities on such nonoperated
    properties depend upon a number of factors, including:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    the nature and timing of drilling and operational activities;




 



     
        • 

    
    the timing and amount of capital expenditures;




 



     
        • 

    
    the operators’ expertise and financial resources;




 



     
        • 

    
    the approval of other participants in such properties; and




 



     
        • 

    
    the selection and application of suitable technology.





 


    If drilling and development activities are not conducted on
    these properties or are not conducted on a timely basis, we may
    be unable to increase our production or offset normal production
    declines or we will be required to write-off the reserves
    attributable thereto, which may adversely affect our production,
    revenues and results of operations. Any such write-offs of our
    reserves could reduce our ability to borrow money and could
    reduce the value of our securities


 



    Uncertainties
    associated with enhanced recovery methods may result in us not
    realizing an acceptable return on our investments in such
    projects.


 


    We inject water into formations on some of our properties to
    increase the production of oil and natural gas. We may in the
    future expand these efforts to more of our properties or employ
    other enhanced recovery methods in our operations. The
    additional production and reserves, if any, attributable to the
    use of enhanced recovery methods are inherently difficult to
    predict. If our enhanced recovery methods do not allow for the
    extraction of oil and natural gas in a manner or to the extent
    that we anticipate, we may not realize an acceptable return on
    our investments in such

    projects. In addition, if proposed legislation and regulatory
    initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing become law, the
    cost of some of these enhanced recovery methods could increase
    substantially.


 



    A
    terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business by
    decreasing our revenues and increasing our costs.


 


    Terrorist activities, anti-terrorist efforts and other armed
    conflict involving the United States may adversely affect the
    United States and global economies and could prevent us from
    meeting our financial and other obligations. If any of these
    events occur or escalate, the resulting political instability
    and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and
    natural gas, potentially putting downward pressure on demand for
    our services and causing a reduction in our revenue. Oil and
    natural gas related facilities could be direct targets of
    terrorist attacks, and our operations could be adversely
    impacted if significant infrastructure or facilities used for
    the production, transportation, processing or marketing of oil
    and natural gas production are destroyed or damaged. Costs for
    insurance and other security may increase as a result of these
    threats, and some insurance coverage may become more difficult
    to obtain, if available at all.



 



    Risks
    Relating to Our Common Stock


 



    Our
    restated certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware
    law contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or
    merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of
    our common stock.


 


    Our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board
    of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder
    approval. If our board of directors elects to issue preferred
    stock, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire
    us. In addition, some provisions of our certificate of
    incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law could make it more
    difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if
    the change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders,
    including:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    the organization of our board of directors as a classified
    board, which allows no more than approximately one-third of our
    directors to be elected each year;




 



     
        • 

    
    stockholders cannot remove directors from our board of directors
    except for cause and then only by the holders of not less than
    662/3 percent
    of the voting power of all outstanding voting stock;




 



     
        • 

    
    the prohibition of stockholder action by written
    consent; and




 



     
        • 

    
    limitations on the ability of our stockholders to call special
    meetings and establish advance notice provisions for stockholder
    proposals and nominations for elections to the board of
    directors to be acted upon at meetings of stockholders.





 



    Because
    we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock, investors
    must look solely to stock appreciation for a return on their
    investment in us.


 


    We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common
    stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain
    all future earnings to fund the development and growth of our
    business. Any payment of future dividends will be at the
    discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among
    other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital
    requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual
    restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other
    considerations that our board of directors deems relevant.
    Covenants contained in our credit facility and the indentures
    governing certain of our senior notes restrict the payment of
    dividends. Investors must rely on sales of their common stock
    after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way
    to realize a return on their investment. Investors seeking cash
    dividends should not purchase our common stock.


 



    The
    availability of shares for sale in the future could reduce the
    market price of our common stock.


 


    In the future, we may issue securities to raise cash for
    acquisitions. We may also acquire interests in other companies
    by using a combination of cash and our common stock or just our
    common stock. We may also issue securities convertible into, or
    exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, our
    common stock. Any of





    
    34

    these events may dilute your ownership interest in our company,
    reduce our earnings per share and have an adverse impact on the
    price of our common stock.


 


    In addition, sales of a substantial amount of our common stock
    in the public market, or the perception that these sales may
    occur, could reduce the market price of our common stock. This
    could also impair our ability to raise additional capital
    through the sale of our securities.
