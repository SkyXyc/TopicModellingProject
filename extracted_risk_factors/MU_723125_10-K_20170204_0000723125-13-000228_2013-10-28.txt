ProductsDynamic Random Access Memory ("DRAM")DRAM products are high-density, low-cost-per-bit, random access memory devices that provide high-speed data storage and retrieval.  DRAM sales products were 48%, 39% and 41% of our total net sales in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  DRAM products are sold by our DSG, WSG and ESG segments and are used in computers, servers, tablets, mobile phones, communication equipment, computer peripherals, industrial, automotive and other electronic devices.  We offer DRAM products with a variety of performance, pricing and other characteristics including high-volume DDR4, DDR3 and DDR2 products as well as specialty DRAM memory products including Mobile Low Power DRAM ("LPDRAM"), DDR, SDRAM, Reduced Latency DRAM ("RLDRAM") and Pseudo-static DRAM ("PSRAM").DDR4, DDR3 and DDR2:  DDR4, DDR3 and DDR2 are standardized, high-density, high-volume, DRAM products.  DDR4, DDR3 and DDR2 products offer high speed and high bandwidth at a relatively low cost.  DDR3 sales were 31%, 20% and 21% of our total net sales in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  DDR2 sales were 7%, 9% and 10% of our total net sales in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  We began sampling DDR4 products in 2013 and expect to begin commercial production of DDR4 products in significant volumes during 2014.In 2013, we offered DDR3 products in 1Gb, 2Gb and 4Gb densities and DDR2 products in 512 megabit ("Mb"), 1 gigabit ("Gb") and 2Gb densities.  These densities enable us to meet customer demands for a broad array of products and we offered these products in multiple configurations, speeds and package types.Specialty DRAM products:  We also offer DRAM memory products including DDR and DDR2 Mobile LPDRAM, DDR, SDRAM, RLDRAM and PSRAM in densities ranging from 64Mb to 4Gb.  LPDRAM products are used primarily in mobile phones, tablets, embedded applications, ultra-thin laptop computers and other mobile consumer devices that require low power consumption.  Our other specialty DRAM products are used primarily in networking devices, servers, consumer electronics, communications equipment, computer peripherals, automotive and industrial applications as well as computer memory upgrades.  In September 2013, we began sampling Hybrid Memory Cube ("HMC") products, which are are semiconductor memory devices where vertical stacks of DRAM die that are connected using through-silicon-via interconnects are placed above a small, high-speed logic layer.  HMC enables ultra-high system performance with significantly lower power-per-bit.  Aggregate sales of LPDRAM and our other specialty DRAM products were 10% of our total net sales in 2013, 2012 and 2011. 3NAND Flash MemoryNAND Flash products are electrically re-writeable, non-volatile semiconductor memory devices that retain content when power is turned off.  NAND Flash sales were 40%, 44% and 36% of our total net sales in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  NAND Flash products are sold by our NSG, WSG and ESG segments.  NAND Flash is ideal for mass-storage devices due to its fast erase and write times, high density and low cost per bit relative to other solid-state memories.  Embedded NAND Flash-based storage devices are utilized in mobile phones, solid-state drives ("SSDs"), tablets, computers, industrial and automotive applications, MP3/4 players and other personal and consumer applications.  Removable storage devices, such as USB and Flash memory cards, are used with applications such as PCs, digital still cameras, MP3/4 players and mobile phones.  The market for NAND Flash products has grown rapidly and we expect it to continue to grow due to demand for these and other removable and embedded storage devices.Our NAND Flash products feature a small cell structure that enables higher densities for demanding applications.  We offer Single-Level Cell ("SLC") NAND Flash products as well as Multi-Level Cell ("MLC") and Triple-Level Cell ("TLC") NAND Flash products, which have two and three times, respectively, the bit density of SLC NAND Flash products.  In 2013, we offered SLC NAND products in 1 Gb to 64Gb densities.  In addition, we offered 8Gb to 128Gb 2-bit-per-cell MLC NAND Flash products and 32Gb to 128Gb 3-bit-per-cell TLC NAND Flash products.  We offer high-speed NAND Flash products that are compatible with advanced interfaces.We offer client and enterprise SSDs which feature higher performance, reduced power consumption and enhanced reliability as compared to typical hard disk drives.  Our client SSDs are targeted at notebook and other consumer applications.  Using our NAND Flash process technology and a leading-edge SATA 6 Gb/s interface, our SSDs deliver read and write speeds that help improve boot and application load times and deliver higher performance than hard disk drives.  Our client SSDs are offered in 2.5-inch and 1.8-inch form factors, with densities up to 960 gigabytes ("GB").  Our enterprise SSDs are targeted at server applications and incorporate our Extended Performance and Enhanced Reliability Technology (XPERT) architecture, which closely incorporates the storage and controller through highly optimized firmware algorithms and hardware enhancements.  The end result is a set of market-focused enterprise features that deliver ultra-low latencies, improved data transfer time, power-loss protection and cost-effectiveness, along with higher capacities and power efficiency.  We offer enterprise SSDs with capacities up to 1.4 terabytes.  We expect that demand for both client and enterprise SSDs will continue to increase significantly over the next several years.We also offer managed NAND and NAND-based multichip packages ("MCPs") products, which incorporate our NAND Flash.  Our managed NAND products combine NAND Flash with a logic controller that performs media management and error code correction ("ECC"), which provides reduced ECC complexity, better system performance, improved reliability, easy integration, and lower overall system costs.  Our managed NAND products include e-MMC memory, embedded USB, and ClearNAND.   Our NAND-based MCPs combine NAND Flash with DRAM and/or other memory devices in a single package, which improves overall functionality and performance while simplifying system design. Through our Lexar®  brand, we sell high-performance digital media products and other flash-based storage products through retail and OEM channels.  Our digital media products include a variety of flash memory cards and JumpDrive™ products with a range of speeds, capacities and value-added features.  We offer flash memory cards in a variety of speeds and capacities and in all major media formats, including:  CompactFlash, Memory Stick and Secure Digital ("SD").  CompactFlash and Memory Stick products sold by us incorporate our patented controller technology.  Other products, including SD memory cards and some JumpDrive products, incorporate third party controllers.  We also manufacture products that are sold under other brand names and resell flash memory products that are purchased from other NAND Flash suppliers. 4NOR Flash MemoryNOR Flash products are electrically re-writeable, non-volatile semiconductor memory devices that retain content when power is turned off, offer fast read times due to random access capability and have execute-in-place ("XiP") capability that enables processors to read NOR Flash without first accessing RAM.  These capabilities make NOR ideal for storing program code in wireless and embedded applications.  Our NOR Flash sales were 9%, 12% and 18% of our total net sales for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  NOR Flash products are sold by our WSG and ESG segments.We offer both parallel and serial interface NOR Flash products in a broad range of densities, packages and features.  Our parallel NOR Flash products are constructed to meet the needs of the consumer electronics, industrial, wired and wireless communications, computing and automotive applications.  These products offer high densities, XiP performance, architectural flexibility and proven reliability in rigorous industrial settings.  Our serial NOR Flash products are designed to meet the needs of consumer electronics, industrial, automotive, wired and wireless communications and computing applications.  These products offer industry-standard packaging, pinouts, command sets and chipset compatibility.Partnering ArrangementsThe following is a summary of our partnering arrangements as of August 29, 2013:   Member or PartnerMicronOwnership InterestFormed/AcquiredProduct MarketConsolidated Entities    IMFT(1) Intel Corporation51%2006NAND FlashMP Mask(2) Photronics, Inc.50%2006Photomasks       Equity Method Investments    Inotera(3) Nanya Technology Corporation35%2009DRAMTera Probe(4) Various40%2013Wafer Probe(1)IMFT: We partner with Intel for the design, development and manufacture of NAND Flash and certain emerging memory products.  In connection therewith, we formed a joint venture with Intel, IM Flash Technologies, LLC ("IMFT"), to manufacture NAND Flash memory products for the exclusive use of the members.  The members share the output of IMFT generally in proportion to their investment.  We sell NAND Flash products to Intel through IMFT at long-term negotiated prices approximating cost.  We generally share product design and other research and development costs for NAND Flash and certain emerging memory technologies equally with Intel.  (See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Consolidated Variable Interest Entities – IM Flash" note.)(2)MP Mask: We produce photomasks for leading-edge and advanced next generation semiconductors through MP Mask Technology Center, LLC ("MP Mask"), a joint venture with Photronics, Inc. ("Photronics").  We and Photronics also have supply arrangements wherein we purchase a substantial majority of the reticles produced by MP Mask.  (See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Consolidated Variable Interest Entities – MP Mask" note.) 5(3)Inotera: We partner with Nanya Technology Corporation ("Nanya") for the manufacture of DRAM products, and through December 2012, the joint development of DRAM process technology.  In connection therewith, we have partnered with Nanya in a DRAM memory company in Taiwan, Inotera Memories, Inc. ("Inotera").  Through December 2012, we had a supply agreement with Inotera and Nanya which gave us the right and obligation to purchase 50% of Inotera's semiconductor memory capacity subject to specific terms and conditions.  Under the formula for this supply agreement, all parties' manufacturing costs related to wafers supplied by Inotera, as well as our and Nanya's revenue for the resale of products from wafers supplied by Inotera, were considered in determining costs for wafers purchased by us from Inotera.  Effective beginning January 2013, we are obligated to purchase for an initial period through January 2016, substantially all of Inotera's output at a purchase price based on a discount from market prices for our comparable components.  In connection with the partnering agreement, we have also deployed and licensed certain intellectual property related to the manufacture of DRAM products to Nanya and licensed certain intellectual property from Nanya.  Through December 2012, we partnered with Nanya to jointly develop process technology and designs to manufacture DRAM products under a cost-sharing arrangement effective beginning in April 2010, under which we shared DRAM development costs with Nanya.  Effective beginning January 2013, Nanya ceased participating in the joint development program.  We receive royalties from Nanya for sales of DRAM products manufactured by or for Nanya with technology developed prior to April 2010.  (See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Equity Method Investments – Inotera" note.)(4)Tera Probe: We have an approximate 40% ownership in Tera Probe, Inc., an entity that provides semiconductor probe and test services.  Tera Probe provides wafer probe services for our Elpida and Rexchip subsidiaries.ManufacturingOur manufacturing facilities are located in the United States, China, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Puerto Rico, Singapore and Taiwan.  Our Inotera joint venture also has a wafer fabrication facility in Taiwan.  In September 2013, we entered into an agreement to sell our 200mm wafer fabrication equipment in Kiryat Gat, Israel to Intel and to terminate the related facility lease with Intel.  If this transaction is completed, Intel will manufacture wafers for us at the Kiryat Gat facility through 2014 through a series of arrangements.  In 2011, we sold our wafer fabrication facility in Japan to Tower Semiconductor Ltd. ("Tower") and entered into a supply agreement for Tower to manufacture products for us in the facility through approximately May 2014.  Our manufacturing facilities generally operate 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive, requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment.  A significant portion of our semiconductor equipment is replaced every three to five years with increasingly advanced equipment.  NAND Flash, DRAM and NOR Flash products share common manufacturing processes, enabling us to leverage our product and process technologies and manufacturing infrastructure across these product lines. Our process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex, involving a number of precise steps, including wafer fabrication, assembly and test.  Efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities.  The primary determinants of manufacturing cost are process line-width, number of mask layers, number of fabrication steps and number of good die produced on each wafer.  Other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are wafer size, cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment, equipment utilization, process complexity, cost of raw materials, labor productivity, package type and cleanliness of the manufacturing environment.  We continuously enhance our production processes, reducing die sizes and transitioning to higher density products.  In 2013, the majority of our DRAM production was manufactured on 30nm line-width process technology.  In connection with our acquisition of Elpida, we expect in 2014 that a significant portion of our DRAM production will be manufactured on 25nm line-width process technology.  In the fourth quarter of 2013, a majority of our NAND Flash memory products were manufactured on our 20nm line-width process technology.  We expect to begin transitioning our NAND Flash production to our 16nm line-width process technology in 2014.  Our NOR Flash memory products in 2013 were manufactured on our 65nm and 45nm line-width process technologies.  We manufacture all of our high-volume NAND Flash and DRAM products on 300mm wafers.  In 2013, we manufactured NOR Flash, some specialty DRAM and non-memory products on 200mm wafers. 6Wafer fabrication occurs in a highly controlled, clean environment to minimize dust and other yield- and quality-limiting contaminants.  Despite stringent manufacturing controls, equipment errors, minute impurities in materials, defects in photomasks, circuit design marginalities or defects and dust particles can lead to wafers being scrapped and individual circuits being nonfunctional.  Success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects to maximize yield of high-quality circuits.  In this regard, we employ rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing, screening and testing processes.  We are able to recover certain devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionality.We test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process, perform high temperature burn-in on finished products and conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow.  In addition, we use our proprietary AMBYX™ line of intelligent test and burn-in systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of semiconductor memory die during the burn-in process, capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost.We sell semiconductor products in both packaged and unpackaged (i.e. "bare die") forms.  Our packaged products include memory modules, MCP's, managed NAND, SSDs, memory cards and USB devices.  We assemble many products in-house and, in some cases, we outsource assembly services where we can reduce costs and minimize our capital investment.  We contract with independent foundries and assembly and testing organizations to manufacture NAND Flash media products such as memory cards and USB devices.In recent years, we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products, which enhances our ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing operations.  Although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes, our overall cost efficiency can be affected by frequent conversions to new products, the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex, smaller-volume parts and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines. Availability of Raw MaterialsOur operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards.  We generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials.  However, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards.  In some cases, materials are provided by a single supplier.  Various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers, photomasks, chemicals, gases including helium, photoresist, lead frames and molding compound.  Shortages may occur from time to time in the future.  In addition, disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials.  Lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past.  If our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.Marketing and CustomersOur products are sold into computing, consumer, networking, telecommunications, automotive, industrial, and mobile markets.  Market concentrations from 2013 net sales were approximately as follows: computing (including desktop PCs, servers, notebooks and workstations), 30%; mobile, 15%; consumer electronics, 15%; SSDs, 15% and networking and storage, 10%.  Sales to Intel, primarily NAND Flash products through IM Flash, were 10% of our net sales in 2013, 12% of our net sales in 2012, and 10% of our net sales in 2011.  Sales to Hewlett-Packard Company, primarily of DRAM, were 10% of our net sales in 2013, 8% of our net sales in 2012 and 9% of our net sales in 2011.  We expect that our acquisition of Elpida will increase our concentration of sales to mobile, graphics and computing markets in 2014.Our semiconductor memory products are offered under the Micron, Lexar®, Crucial™, SpecTek® and Elpida brand names and private labels.  We market our semiconductor memory products primarily through our own direct sales force and maintain sales or representative offices in our primary markets around the world.  We sell Lexar-branded NAND Flash memory products primarily through retail channels and our Crucial-branded products through a web-based customer direct sales channel as well as channel and distribution partners.  Our products are also offered through independent sales representatives and distributors.  Independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by us and are compensated on a commission basis.  We make shipments against these orders directly to the customer.  Distributors carry our products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products, including competitors' products.  We maintain inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of products.  Many of our customers require a thorough review or qualification of semiconductor products, which may take several months.BacklogBecause of volatile industry conditions, customers are reluctant to enter into long-term, fixed-price contracts.  Accordingly, new order volumes for our semiconductor products fluctuate significantly.  We typically accept orders with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the date of shipment.  For these reasons, we do not believe that our order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period.Product WarrantyBecause the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex, it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications, contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses.  In accordance with industry practice, we generally provide a limited warranty that our products are in compliance with our specifications existing at the time of delivery.  Under our general terms and conditions of sale, liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of, or a credit with respect to, amounts paid for such items.  Under certain circumstances, we provide more extensive limited warranty coverage than that provided under our general terms and conditions.CompetitionWe face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies, including Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.; SanDisk Corporation; SK Hynix Inc.; Spansion Inc. and Toshiba Corporation.  Some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete, invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities.  Our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity, improve yields, reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs resulting in significantly increased worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices.  Many of our high-volume memory products are manufactured to industry standard specifications and as such have similar performance characteristics to those of our competitors.  For these high-volume memory products, the principal competitive factors are generally price and performance characteristics including:  operating speed, power consumption, reliability, compatibility, size and form factors.  For our other memory products, the aforementioned performance characteristics generally take precedence to pricing.Research and DevelopmentOur process technology R&D efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller line-width process technologies, as well as  new fundamentally different  memory structures, materials and packages,  which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation memory products.  Additional process technology R&D efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing and mobile memory architectures, the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise and the development of new manufacturing materials.  Product design and development efforts include our high density DDR3 and DDR4 DRAM and Mobile Low Power DDR DRAM products as well as high density and mobile NAND Flash memory (including MLC and TLC technologies), NOR Flash memory, specialty memory, SSDs, hybrid memory cubes and other memory technologies and systems.Our R&D expenses were $931 million, $918 million and $791 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  We generally share R&D process and design costs for NAND Flash with Intel.  We also share R&D costs for certain emerging memory technologies with Intel.  We generally shared R&D process and design costs for DRAM with Nanya through December 2012, when our cost-sharing agreement was terminated.  As a result of reimbursements under our Intel and Nanya cost-sharing arrangements, our overall R&D expenses were reduced by $146 million, $225 million and $236 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. 7To compete in the semiconductor memory industry, we must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes.  We believe that expansion of our semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for specific memory solutions.  Our process, design and package development efforts occur at multiple locations across the world, with our largest  R&D centers located in  Boise, Idaho and Hiroshima, Japan.  Our largest design center is also located at our corporate headquarters in Boise, Idaho.  We have several additional product design centers in other strategic locations around the world.  In 2012, we commenced operation of our new R&D facility in Boise, which was designed to accommodate 450mm wafer manufacturing.  In addition, we develop photolithography mask technology at our MP Mask joint venture facility in Boise.R&D expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed, the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development, and personnel costs.  Because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products, we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing.  We deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability.  R&D expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification.Geographic InformationSales to customers outside the United States totaled $7.6 billion for 2013 and included $3.8 billion in sales in China, $980 million in sales in Taiwan, $820 million in sales in Europe, $193 million in sales in Malaysia and $1.3 billion in sales in the rest of the Asia Pacific region (excluding China, Malaysia and Taiwan).  Sales to customers outside the United States totaled $7.0 billion for 2012 and $7.4 billion for 2011.  As of August 29, 2013, we had net property, plant and equipment of $3.2 billion in Singapore, $3.0 billion in the United States, $615 million in Japan, $350 million in China, $307 million in Taiwan, $28 million in Israel, $18 million in Italy and $42 million in other countries.  (See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data –Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Geographic Information" note and "Item 1A. Risk Factors.")Patents and LicensesIn recent years, we have been recognized as a leader in per capita and quality of patents issued.  As of August 29, 2013, we owned approximately 16,200 U.S. patents and 3,700 foreign patents.  In addition, we have numerous U.S. and foreign patent applications pending.  Our patents have various terms expiring through 2032.We have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements and have from time to time licensed or sold our intellectual property to third parties.  Some of these license agreements require us to make one-time or periodic payments while others have resulted in us receiving payments.  We may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future and we may enter into additional sales or licenses of intellectual property and potential partnering arrangements.  We are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms.EmployeesAs of August 29, 2013, we had approximately 30,900 employees, of which approximately 19,600 were outside the United States, including approximately 7,500 in Singapore, 3,700 in Japan, 2,700 in China, 2,100 in Taiwan, 1,100 in Italy, 1,000 in Israel and 1,000 in Malaysia.  Our employees include approximately 1,700 in our IMFT joint venture, primarily located in the United States and 5,700 from our acquisition of Elpida and Rexchip, primarily located in Japan and Taiwan.  In September 2013, we entered into an agreement to sell our 200mm wafer fabrication equipment in Kiryat Gat, Israel to Intel and to terminate the related facility lease with Intel.  If this transaction is completed, most of our employees in Israel will terminate their employment with us and be transferred to Intel.  As of August 29, 2013, we do not anticipate incurring any significant additional costs for this restructure activity.  Our employment levels can vary depending on market conditions and the level of our production, research and product and process development.  Many of our employees are highly skilled and our continued success depends in part upon our ability to attract and retain such employees.  The loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 8Environmental ComplianceGovernment regulations impose various environmental controls on raw materials and discharges, emissions and solid wastes from our manufacturing processes.  In 2013, our wafer fabrication facilities continued to conform to the requirements of ISO 14001 certification.  To continue certification, we met annual requirements in environmental policy, compliance, planning, management, structure and responsibility, training, communication, document control, operational control, emergency preparedness and response, record keeping and management review.  While we have not experienced any material adverse effects to our operations from environmental regulations, changes in the regulations could necessitate additional capital expenditures, modification of our operations or other compliance actions.Directors and Executive Officers of the RegistrantOur officers are appointed annually by the Board of Directors and our directors are elected annually by our shareholders.  Any directors appointed by the Board of Directors to fill vacancies on the Board serve until the next election by the shareholders.  All officers and directors serve until their successors are duly chosen or elected and qualified, except in the case of earlier death, resignation or removal.As of August 29, 2013, the following executive officers and directors were subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.Name Age PositionMark W.

RISK FACTORSIn addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of us.We have experienced dramatic declines in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products which have adversely affected our business.If average selling prices for our memory products decrease faster than we can decrease per gigabit costs, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.  We have experienced significant decreases in our average selling prices per gigabit in recent years as noted in the table below and may continue to experience such decreases in the future.  In some prior periods, average selling prices for our memory products have been below our manufacturing costs and we may experience such circumstances in the future.  DRAM  Trade NAND Flash*  (percentage change in average selling prices)2013 from 2012 (11)%  (18)%2012 from 2011 (45)%  (55)%2011 from 2010 (39)%  (12)%2010 from 2009 28%  26%2009 from 2008 (52)%  (52)%* Trade NAND Flash excludes sales to Intel from IM Flash.     We may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at the rate average selling prices decline.Our gross margins are dependent upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes, including reducing the die size of our existing products.  In future periods, we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to improve or maintain gross margins.  Factors that may limit our ability to reduce costs include, but are not limited to, strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix, the increasing complexity of manufacturing processes, difficulty in transitioning to smaller line-width process technologies, technological barriers and changes in process technologies or products that may require relatively larger die sizes.  Per gigabit manufacturing costs may also be affected by the relatively smaller production quantities and shorter product lifecycles of certain specialty memory products.The semiconductor memory industry is highly competitive.We face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies, including Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.; SanDisk Corporation; SK Hynix Inc.; Spansion Inc. and Toshiba Corporation.  Some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete, invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities.  Our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity, improve yields, reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs.  Transitions to smaller line-width process technologies and product and process improvements have resulted in significant increases in the worldwide supply of semiconductor memory.  Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory also result from semiconductor memory fab capacity expansions, either by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory production.  Our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply.  Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory, if not accompanied with commensurate increases in demand, would lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 12Our acquisitions of Elpida and Rexchip involve numerous risks.On July 31, 2013, we completed the acquisition of Elpida, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Sponsor Agreement that we entered into on July 2, 2012, with the trustees of the Elpida Companies pursuant to and in connection with the Elpida Companies' pending corporate reorganization proceedings under the Corporate Reorganization Act of Japan.  We paid $615 million for the acquisition of 100% of Elpida's equity.  On July 31, 2013, we also acquired a 24% ownership interest in Rexchip from the Powerchip Group pursuant to a share purchase agreement.  We paid $334 million in cash for the shares.  The Elpida Group owns approximately 65% of Rexchip's outstanding common stock.  Therefore, as a result of the consummation of our acquisition of Elpida and the Rexchip shares from the Powerchip Group, we own approximately 89% of Rexchip's common stock.  The provisional fair values of assets and liabilities acquired include, among other items, cash and restricted cash aggregating $1,618 million, inventories of $962 million; property, plant and equipment of $935 million; net deferred tax assets of $917 million and debt of $2,134 million.In addition to the acquisition risks described elsewhere, these acquisitions are expected to involve the following significant risks:•we may be unable to maintain customers, successfully execute our integration strategies, or achieve planned synergies;•we may be unable to accurately forecast the anticipated financial results of the combined business;•our consolidated financial condition may be adversely impacted by the increased leverage resulting from the transactions;•increased exposure to the DRAM market, which experienced significant declines in pricing during the first quarter of 2013 as well as 2012 and 2011;•deterioration of Elpida's and Rexchip's operations and customer base following closing;•increased exposure to operating costs denominated in yen and New Taiwan dollar;•integration issues with Elpida's and Rexchip's primary manufacturing operations in Japan and Taiwan;•integration issues of our product and process technology with Elpida and Rexchip;•integration of business systems and processes; and•an overlap in customers.Our acquisitions of Elpida and Rexchip are inherently risky, may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.The operations of the Elpida Companies will be subject to continued oversight by the Japan Court during the pendency of the corporate reorganization proceedings.Because the plans of reorganization of the Elpida Companies provide for ongoing payments to creditors following the closing of our acquisition of Elpida, the Japan Proceedings are continuing, and the Elpida Companies remain subject to the oversight of the Japan Court and of the trustees (including a trustee designated by us, who we refer to as the business trustee, and a trustee designated by the Japan Court, who we refer to as the legal trustee), pending completion of the Japan Proceedings.  The Japan Proceedings and oversight of the Japan Court are expected to continue until the final creditor payment is made under the Elpida Companies' plans of reorganization, which is scheduled to occur in December 2019, but may occur on a later date to the extent any claims of creditors remain unfixed on the final scheduled installment payment date.  Although we may be able to petition the court to terminate the Japan Proceedings once two-thirds of all payments under the plans of reorganization are made, there can be no assurance that the Japan Court will grant any such petition.During the pendency of the Japan Proceedings, the Elpida Companies are obligated to provide periodic financial reports to the Japan Court and may be required to obtain the consent of the Japan Court prior to taking a number of significant actions relating to their businesses, including transferring or disposing of, or acquiring, certain material assets, incurring or guaranteeing material indebtedness, settling disputes or entering into certain material agreements.  The consent of the legal trustee may also be required for matters that would likely have a material impact on the operations or assets of the Elpida Companies and their subsidiaries or for transfers of material assets, to the extent the matters or transfers would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect execution of the plans of reorganization of the Elpida Companies.  Accordingly, during the pendency of the Japan Proceedings, our ability to effectively integrate the Elpida Companies as part of our global operations or to cause the Elpida Companies to take certain actions that we deem advisable for their businesses could be adversely affected if the Japan Court or the legal trustee is unwilling to consent to various actions that we may wish to take with respect to the Elpida Companies. 13Our acquisitions of Elpida and Rexchip expose us to significant risks from changes in currency exchange rates.Under the Sponsor Agreement, we committed to support plans of reorganization for Elpida that provide for payments to the secured and unsecured creditors of Elpida in an aggregate amount of 200 billion yen.  The U.S. dollar amount of this payment obligation could increase if the yen strengthens against the U.S. dollar.  Additionally, a significant portion of Elpida's and Rexchip's operating costs are paid in Yen and New Taiwan dollars so our operating results subsequent to the acquisition could also be adversely impacted if these currencies strengthen against the U.S. dollar.Our acquisitions of Elpida and Rexchip may increase our risk of significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting.Elpida and Rexchip have not performed an assessment of the effectiveness of the design and operation of their internal control over financial reporting.  In addition, Elpida and Rexchip have not historically prepared their financial statements under U.S. generally accepted accounting standards.  Elpida and Rexchip were not required to be included in our assessment of internal controls for 2013 but will be included in our assessment for 2014, which may increase our risk for material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.Debt obligations could adversely affect our financial condition.We are engaged in a capital intensive business subject to significant changes in supply and demand and product pricing and recent periods of consolidation, any of which could result in our incurrence or assumption of indebtedness.  In recent periods, our debt levels have increased.  As of August 29, 2013, we had $6.0 billion of debt, including $485 million principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2014.  As of August 29, 2013, we had two credit facilities available that provides for up to $408 million of additional financing, subject to outstanding balances of trade receivables and other conditions.  Events and circumstances may occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy the applicable drawdown conditions and utilize either of these facilities.  We have in the past and expect in the future to continue to incur additional debt to finance our capital investments, including debt incurred in connection with asset-backed financing.The plans of reorganization of the Elpida Companies provide for payments by the Elpida Companies to their secured and unsecured creditors in an aggregate amount of 200 billion yen (or the equivalent of approximately $2.05 billion), less certain expenses of the Japan Proceedings and certain other items.  If the resolution of certain unfixed claims under the plans of reorganization, primarily comprised of outstanding litigation claims, would result in payments in respect of those claims in excess of amounts reserved under the plans of reorganization to satisfy such claims, there is a possibility that the Elpida Companies would be required to pay more than 200 billion yen to their pre-petition creditors under the plans of reorganization.  In addition, if these unfixed claims are resolved pursuant to settlement arrangements or other post-petition agreements, a substantial portion of the amounts payable with respect to the claims may have to be funded by the Elpida Companies outside of the installment payments provided for by the plans of reorganization.Our debt and our guarantee obligations could adversely impact us.  For example, these obligations could:•require us to use a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on debt, which will reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development expenditures and other business activities; •limit our future ability to raise funds for capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, research and development and other general corporate requirements;•contribute to a future downgrade of our credit rating, which could increase future borrowing costs; and•increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and semiconductor memory industry conditions.Our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future.  This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control.  There can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that additional capital will be available to us, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs.  If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital.  If we were unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 14We may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations, make scheduled debt payments and make adequate capital investments.Our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory sold, average selling prices and per unit manufacturing costs.  To develop new product and process technologies, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality, we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology, capital equipment, facilities, R&D and product and process technology.  We estimate that capital spending for 2014 will be approximately $2.6 billion to $3.2 billion.  In addition, as a result of the Elpida acquisition, we believe that our future capital spending will be higher than our historical levels as we integrate our manufacturing operations and support the increase of capacity resulting from the Elpida transaction.  As of August 29, 2013, we had cash and equivalents of $2,880 million, short-term investments of $221 million and long-term marketable investments of $499 million.  Cash and investments included $1,094 million held by Elpida and its consolidated subsidiaries and $62 million held by IM Flash Technologies, LLC ("IMFT"), none of which is generally available to finance our other operations.As a result of the Japan Proceedings, for so long as such proceedings are continuing, the Elpida Companies and their subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions on dividends, loans and advances.  The plans of reorganization of the Elpida Companies prohibit the Elpida Companies from paying dividends, including any cash dividends, to us and require that excess earnings be used in their businesses or to fund the Elpida Companies' installment payments.  These prohibitions would also effectively prevent the subsidiaries of the Elpida Companies from paying  cash dividends to us in respect of the shares of such subsidiaries owned by the Elpida Companies, as any such dividends would have to be first paid to the Elpida Companies which are prohibited from repaying those amounts to us as dividends under the plans of reorganization.  In addition, pursuant to an order of the Japan Court, the Elpida Companies cannot make loans or advances, other than certain ordinary course advances, to us without the consent of the Japan Court.  Moreover, loans or advances by subsidiaries of the Elpida Companies may be considered outside of the ordinary course of business and subject to approval of the legal trustees and Japan Court.  As a result, the assets of the Elpida Companies and their subsidiaries, while available to satisfy the Elpida Companies' installment payments and the other obligations, capital expenditures and other operating needs of the Elpida Companies and their subsidiaries, are not available for use by us  in our other operations.  Moreover, certain uses of the assets of the Elpida Companies, including investments in certain capital expenditures and in Rexchip, may require consent of Elpida's trustees and/or the Japan Court.In the past we have utilized external sources of financing when needed.  As a result of our current debt levels, expected debt amortization and general economic conditions, it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows, use cash held by Elpida to fund its capital expenditures, access capital markets or find other sources of financing to fund our operations, make debt amortization payments and make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency.  Our inability to do the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Our Inotera Supply Agreement involves numerous risks.On January 17, 2013, we entered into a new supply agreement with Inotera (the "Inotera Supply Agreement") under which we are obligated to purchase substantially all of Inotera's output at a purchase price based on a discount from market prices for our comparable components.  Our Inotera Supply Agreement involves numerous risks including the following:•higher costs for supply obtained under the market-based provisions of the Inotera Supply Agreement;•difficulties and delays in ramping production at Inotera and delays in the future; and•difficulties in transferring technology to Inotera.Inotera's financial situation may adversely impact the value of our interest and our supply agreement.As of June 30, 2013, Inotera's current liabilities exceeded its current assets by $1.0 billion, which exposes Inotera to liquidity risk.  Additionally, Inotera incurred net losses of $541 million for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2012.  As of June 30, 2013, Inotera was not in compliance with certain loan covenants, and had not been in compliance for the past several years, which may result in its lenders requiring repayment of such loans during the next year.  Inotera has applied for a waiver from complying with the June 30, 2013 financial covenants.  Inotera's management has implemented plans to improve its liquidity and for its six-month period ended June 30, 2013, Inotera generated net income of $91 million; however, there can be no assurance that Inotera will be successful in sufficiently improving its liquidity and complying with their loan covenants, which may result in its lenders requiring repayment of such loans during the next year.  If Inotera is unable to continue to improve its liquidity, we may have to impair our investment in Inotera. 15On January 17, 2013, we entered into agreements with Nanya Technology Corporation ("Nanya") to amend the joint venture relationship involving Inotera.  Under the Inotera Supply Agreement we purchase substantially all of Inotera's output at a purchase price based on a discount from actual market prices for comparable components.  The Inotera Supply Agreement was retroactively effective beginning on January 1, 2013.  For the fourth quarter of 2013, we purchased $518 million of DRAM products from Inotera and our supply from Inotera accounted for 50% of our aggregate DRAM gigabit production.  If our supply of DRAM from Inotera is impacted, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.Across our multi-national operations, there are transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency), primarily the Singapore dollar, euro, shekel and yen.  We recorded net losses from changes in currency exchange rates of $229 million for 2013, $6 million for 2012 and $6 million for 2011.  Based on our foreign currency exposures from monetary assets and liabilities, offset by balance sheet hedges, we estimate that a 10% adverse change in exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar would result in losses of approximately $19 million as of August 29, 2013.  In the event that the U.S. dollar weakens significantly compared to the Singapore dollar, euro, shekel or yen, our results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected.In connection with the Elpida Sponsor Agreement and Rexchip Share Purchase Agreement, we entered into currency hedges to mitigate the risk that increases in exchange rates have on our planned yen payments.  In 2013, we recognized losses of $228 million on these hedges and made payments of $222 million to settle these hedges.  As of August 29, 2013, to hedge certain yen-denominated payments resulting from our acquisition of Elpida, we had an outstanding forward contract to purchase 20 billion yen on November 28, 2014 at a yen per U.S. dollar exchange rate of 98.53 and a forward contract to purchase 10 billion yen on November 27, 2015 at a yen per U.S. dollar exchange rate of 97.25.The financial crisis and overall downturn in the worldwide economy may harm our business.The financial crisis and the overall downturn in the worldwide economy have had an adverse effect on our business.  A continuation or further deterioration of depressed economic conditions could have an even greater adverse effect on our business, including any economic downturn resulting from the shutdown of the U.S. federal government or any default by the U.S. federal government on any of its debt or other obligations.  Adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that incorporate our products, such as personal computers, networking products and mobile devices.  Reduced demand for these products could result in significant decreases in our average selling prices and product sales.  A deterioration of current conditions in worldwide credit markets would limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures.  In addition, we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties.  Difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of loss on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults.  As a result, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.We may incur additional material restructure or other charges in future periods.In response to severe downturns in the semiconductor memory industry and global economic conditions, we implemented restructure activities and may implement restructure initiatives in future periods.  We may restructure or dispose of assets as we continue to optimize our manufacturing operations, including the wind-down of 200-millimeter wafer capacity as we migrate more products to 300-millimeter wafer production.  As a result, we could incur restructure charges (including but not limited to severance and other termination benefits, losses on disposition or impairment of equipment or other long-lived assets and inventory write downs), lose production output, lose key personnel and experience disruptions in our operations and difficulties in the timely delivery of products.  In connection with these actions, we recorded $126 million in 2013 and may incur restructure charges or other losses associated with other initiatives in future periods.We may make future acquisitions and/or alliances, which involve numerous risks.Acquisitions and the formation or operation of alliances, such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements, involve numerous risks including the following:•integrating the operations, technologies and products of acquired or newly formed entities into our operations;•increasing capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain facilities;•increased debt levels; 16•the assumption of unknown or underestimated liabilities;•the use of cash to finance a transaction, which may reduce the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other business activities;•diverting management's attention from normal daily operations;•managing larger or more complex operations and facilities and employees in separate and diverse geographic areas; •hiring and retaining key employees;•requirements imposed by governmental authorities in connection with the regulatory review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures or restrictions on the conduct of our business or the acquired business;•inability to realize synergies or other expected benefits;•failure to maintain customer, vendor and other relationships;•inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company's internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and/or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices; and•impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the acquired business.In recent years, supply of memory products has significantly exceeded customer demand resulting in significant declines in average selling prices for DRAM, NAND Flash and NOR Flash products.  Resulting operating losses have led to the deterioration in the financial condition of a number of industry participants, including the liquidation of Qimonda AG and the 2012 bankruptcy filing by Elpida Memory, Inc.  These types of proceedings often lead to confidential court-directed processes involving the sale of related businesses or assets.  We believe the global memory industry is experiencing a period of consolidation as a result of these market conditions and other factors, and we may engage in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and similar opportunities arising out of these industry conditions.  To the extent we are successful in completing any such transactions, we could be subject to some or all of the risks described above, including the risks pertaining to funding, assumption of liabilities, integration challenges and increases in debt that may accompany such transactions.  Acquisitions of, or alliances with, high-technology companies are inherently risky and may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.Our future success depends on our ability to develop and produce competitive new memory technologies.Our key semiconductor memory technologies of DRAM, NAND Flash and NOR Flash face technological barriers to continue to meet long-term customer needs.  These barriers include potential limitations on the ability to shrink products in order to reduce costs, meet higher density requirements and improve power consumption and reliability.  To meet these requirements, we expect that new memory technologies will be developed by the semiconductor memory industry.  Our competitors are working to develop new memory technologies that may offer performance and/or cost advantages to our existing memory technologies and render existing technologies obsolete.  Accordingly, our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory technologies.  There can be no assurance of the following:•that we will be successful in developing competitive new semiconductor memory technologies;•that we will be able to cost-effectively manufacture new products;•that we will be able to successfully market these technologies; and•that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts.If our efforts to develop new semiconductor memory technologies are unsuccessful, our business, results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected. 17The acquisition of our ownership interest in Inotera from Qimonda has been legally challenged by the administrator of the insolvency proceedings for Qimonda.On January 20, 2011, Dr. Michael Jaffé, administrator for Qimonda AG ("Qimonda") insolvency proceedings, filed suit against us and Micron Semiconductor B.V., our Netherlands subsidiary, in the District Court of Munich, Civil Chamber.  The complaint seeks to void under Section 133 of the German Insolvency Act a share purchase agreement between us and Qimonda signed in fall 2008 pursuant to which we purchased all of Qimonda's shares of Inotera Memories, Inc. and seeks an order requiring us to retransfer the Inotera shares purchased from Qimonda to the Qimonda estate.  The complaint also seeks to terminate under Sections 103 or 133 of the German Insolvency Code a patent cross license between us and Qimonda entered into at the same time as the share purchase agreement.  A three-judge panel will render a decision after a series of hearings with pleadings, arguments and witnesses.  Hearings were held on September 25, 2012, February 5, 2013, June 11, 2013 and July 2, 2013.  An additional hearing is scheduled for November 12, 2013.  We are unable to predict the outcome of this lawsuit and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss.  The final resolution of this lawsuit could result in the loss of the Inotera shares or equivalent monetary damages and the termination of the patent cross license, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation or financial condition.  As of August 29, 2013, the Inotera shares purchased from Qimonda had a carrying value of $190 million.Our joint ventures and strategic relationships involve numerous risks.We have entered into strategic relationships to manufacture products and develop new manufacturing process technologies and products.  These relationships include our IMFT NAND Flash joint venture with Intel Corporation ("Intel"), our Inotera DRAM joint venture with Nanya and our MP Mask joint venture with Photronics.  These joint ventures and strategic relationships are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations.  These risks include the following:•our interests could diverge from our partners or we may not be able to agree with partners on ongoing manufacturing and operational activities, or on the amount, timing or nature of further investments in our joint venture;•we may experience difficulties in transferring technology to joint ventures;•we may experience difficulties and delays in ramping production at joint ventures;•our control over the operations of our joint ventures is limited;•we may recognize losses from equity investment Inotera in our future results of operations;•due to financial constraints, our joint venture partners may be unable to meet their commitments to us or our joint ventures and may pose credit risks for our transactions with them;•due to differing business models or long-term business goals, our partners may decide not to join us in funding capital investment by our joint ventures, which may result in higher levels of cash expenditures by us;•cash flows may be inadequate to fund increased capital requirements;•we may experience difficulties or delays in collecting amounts due to us from our joint ventures and partners;•the terms of our partnering arrangements may turn out to be unfavorable; and•changes in tax, legal or regulatory requirements may necessitate changes in the agreements with our partners.If our joint ventures and strategic relationships are unsuccessful, our business, results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected. 18An adverse outcome relating to allegations of anticompetitive conduct could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.On May 5, 2004, Rambus, Inc. ("Rambus") filed a complaint in the Superior Court of the State of California (San Francisco County) against us and other DRAM suppliers which alleged that the defendants harmed Rambus by engaging in concerted and unlawful efforts affecting Rambus DRAM by eliminating competition and stifling innovation in the market for computer memory technology and computer memory chips.  Rambus' complaint alleged various causes of action under California state law including, among other things, a conspiracy to restrict output and fix prices, a conspiracy to monopolize, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, and unfair competition.  Rambus sought a judgment for damages of approximately $3.9 billion, joint and several liability, trebling of damages awarded, punitive damages, a permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from the conduct alleged in the complaint, interest, and attorneys' fees and costs.  Trial began on June 20, 2011, and the case went to the jury on September 21, 2011.  On November 16, 2011, the jury found for us on all claims.  On April 2, 2012, Rambus filed a notice of appeal to the California 1st District Court of Appeal.We are unable to predict the outcome of this matter.  An adverse court determination of any lawsuit alleging violations of antitrust laws could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.An adverse determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.On January 13, 2006, Rambus filed a lawsuit against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Rambus alleges that certain of our DDR2, DDR3, RLDRAM, and RLDRAM II products infringe as many as fourteen Rambus patents and seeks monetary damages, treble damages, and injunctive relief.  The accused products account for a significant portion of our net sales.  On June 2, 2006, we filed an answer and counterclaim against Rambus alleging, among other things, antitrust and fraud claims.  On January 9, 2009, in another lawsuit involving us and Rambus and involving allegations by Rambus of patent infringement against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, Judge Robinson entered an opinion in favor of us holding that Rambus had engaged in spoliation and that the twelve Rambus patents in the suit were unenforceable against us.  Rambus subsequently appealed the Delaware Court's decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  On May 13, 2011, the Federal Circuit affirmed Judge Robinson's finding of spoliation, but vacated the dismissal sanction and remanded the case to the Delaware District Court for analysis of the remedy based on the Federal Circuit's decision.  On January 2, 2013, Judge Robinson entered a new opinion in our favor holding that Rambus had engaged in spoliation, that Rambus' spoliation was done in bad faith, that the spoliation prejudiced us, and that the appropriate sanction was to declare the twelve Rambus patents in the suit unenforceable against us.  On March 27, 2013, Rambus filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  The Northern District of California Court stayed the trial of the patent phase of the Northern District of California case upon appeal of the spoliation issue to the Federal Circuit.  In addition, others have asserted, and may assert in the future, that our products or manufacturing processes infringe their intellectual property rights.  (See "Item 1. Legal Proceedings" for additional details on these lawsuits.)We are unable to predict the outcome of assertions of infringement made against us.  A court determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could result in significant liability and/or require us to make material changes to our products and/or manufacturing processes.  Any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.We have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements.  Some of these license agreements require us to make one time or periodic payments.  We may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future.  We are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms.Products that fail to meet specifications, are defective or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us.Products that do not meet specifications or that contain, or are perceived by our customers to contain, defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.  From time to time we experience problems with nonconforming, defective or incompatible products after we have shipped such products.  In recent periods we have further diversified and expanded our product offerings which could potentially increase the chance that one or more of our products could fail to meet specifications in a particular application.  As a result of these problems we could be adversely affected in several ways, including the following:  19•we may be required to compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible product or replace products;•we could incur a decrease in revenue or adjustment to pricing commensurate with the reimbursement of such costs or alleged damages; and•we may encounter adverse publicity, which could cause a decrease in sales of our products.New product development may be unsuccessful.We are developing new products that complement our traditional memory products or leverage their underlying design or process technology.  We have made significant investments in product and process technologies and anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product development over the next several years.  The process to develop DRAM, NAND Flash, NOR Flash and certain specialty memory products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance, many times well in advance of a planned ramp of production, in order to secure design wins with our customers.  There can be no assurance that our product development efforts will be successful, that we will be able to cost-effectively manufacture new products, that we will be able to successfully market these products or that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts.If our manufacturing process is disrupted, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.We manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance.  Difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs.  We maintain operations and continuously implement new product and process technology at our manufacturing operations which are widely dispersed in multiple locations in several countries including the U.S., Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, Israel and China.  Additionally, our control over operations at our IMFT, Inotera and MP Mask and Tera Probe joint ventures is limited by our agreements with our partners.  From time to time, we have experienced disruptions in our manufacturing process as a result of power outages, improperly functioning equipment and equipment failures.  If production at a fabrication facility is disrupted for any reason, manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers' requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers.  This could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs or loss of revenues or damage to customer relationships, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.Consolidation of industry participants and governmental assistance to some of our competitors may contribute to uncertainty in the semiconductor memory industry and negatively impact our ability to compete.In recent years, supply of memory products has significantly exceeded customer demand resulting in significant declines in average selling prices of DRAM, NAND Flash and NOR Flash products and substantial operating losses by us and our competitors.  The operating losses as well as limited access to sources of financing have led to the deterioration in the financial condition of a number of industry participants and significant recent consolidation and, in certain cases, liquidation.  Some of our competitors may try to enhance their capacity and lower their cost structure through consolidation.  In addition, some governments have provided, and may be considering providing, significant financial assistance to some of our competitors.  Consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage.The limited availability of raw materials, supplies or capital equipment could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.Our operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards.  We generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials.  However, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards.  In some cases, materials are provided by a single supplier.  Various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers, photomasks, chemicals, gases including helium, photoresist, lead frames and molding compound.  Shortages may occur from time to time in the future.  In addition, disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials.  Lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past.  If our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 20Our operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes.  For certain key types of equipment, including photolithography tools, we are sometimes dependent on a single supplier.  In recent periods we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to the supplier's limited capacity.  Our inability to timely obtain this equipment could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce costs.  Delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production at new facilities and increase our overall costs of the ramp.  If we are unable to timely obtain advanced semiconductor equipment, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.Our results of operations could be affected by natural disasters and other events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate. We have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events including earthquakes or tsunamis that could disrupt operations.  In addition, our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations.  A natural disaster, fire, chemical explosion or other event that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations, or the operations of our customers or suppliers, may adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.Our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be limited.We have a valuation allowance against substantially all U.S. net deferred tax assets as well as $1.5 billion related to our foreign subsidiaries.  As of August 29, 2013, our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards were $4.2 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively.  If not utilized, our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates through 2033.  As of August 29, 2013, our federal and state tax credit carryforwards were $238 million and $203 million, respectively.  If not utilized, our federal and state tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates through 2033.  As of August 29, 2013, our foreign net operating loss carryforwards were $7.0 billion, of which $5.9 billion pertains to Elpida.  We have placed a valuation allowance against $4.7 billion of these foreign net operating loss carryforwards, of which $3.8 billion pertains to Elpida.  If not utilized, our foreign net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates through 2023. We face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.Sales to customers outside the United States approximated 83% of our consolidated net sales for 2013.  In addition, a substantial portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside the United States.  In particular, a significant portion of our manufacturing operations are concentrated in Singapore.  Our international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks, including:•export and import duties, changes to import and export regulations, and restrictions on the transfer of funds;•compliance with U.S. and international laws involving international operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, export control laws and similar rules and regulations;•political and economic instability;•problems with the transportation or delivery of our products;•issues arising from cultural or language differences and labor unrest;•longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;•compliance with trade, technical standards and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions;•contractual and regulatory limitations on our ability to maintain flexibility with our staffing levels;•disruptions to our manufacturing operations as a result of actions imposed by foreign governments;•changes in economic policies of foreign governments; and•difficulties in staffing and managing international operations.These factors may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 21Breaches of our network security could expose us to losses.We manage and store on our network systems, various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations.  We also process, store, and transmit large amounts of data for our customers, including sensitive personal information.  Computer programmers and hackers may be able to gain unauthorized access to our network system and steal proprietary information, compromise confidential information, create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns.  These parties may also be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that disrupt our operations and create security vulnerabilities.  Attacks on our network systems could result in significant losses and damage our reputation with customers.We are subject to counterparty default risks. We have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that subject us to counterparty default risks, including cash deposits, investments, foreign currency option and forward contracts, and capped-call contracts on our stock.  As a result, we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these arrangements will default on its performance obligations.  A counterparty may not comply with their contractual commitments which could then lead to their defaulting on their obligations with little or no notice to us, which could limit our ability to take action to mitigate our exposure.  Additionally, our ability to mitigate our exposures may be constrained by the terms of our contractual arrangements or because market conditions prevent us from taking effective action.  If one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty's default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceeding.  In the event of such default, we could incur significant losses, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations or financial condition. Compliance with new regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.Increased focus on environmental protection and social responsibility initiatives led to the passage of Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), and its implementing SEC regulations.  The Dodd-Frank Act imposes new supply chain diligence and disclosure requirements for certain manufacturers of products containing specific minerals that may originate in or near the Democratic Republic of the Congo (the "DRC") and finance or benefit local armed groups.  These "conflict minerals" are commonly found in materials used in the manufacture of semiconductors.  The implementation of these new regulations may limit the sourcing and availability of some of these materials.  This in turn may affect our ability to obtain materials necessary for the manufacture of our products in sufficient quantities and may affect related material pricing.  Some of our customers may elect to disqualify us as a supplier if we are unable to verify that our products are DRC conflict free.ITEM 1B
