Information about the Company is available on our website at www.flir.com.TECHNOLOGY AND CAPABILITIESInfrared is a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that is adjacent to the visible spectrum but is invisible to the human eye due to its longer wavelengths. Unlike visible light, infrared radiation (or heat) is emitted directly by all objects above absolute zero in temperature. Thermal imaging systems detect this infrared radiation and convert it into an electronic signal, which is then processed into a video signal and displayed on a video screen. Thermal sensors provide several benefits over ubiquitous visible light-based sensing technologies, including the ability to see in complete darkness, measure temperature remotely and without touching the surface of the object, image through obscurants such as smoke and fog, detect and discriminate living beings in an efficient and reliable way, see over long distances with minimal atmospheric interference, and image many types of otherwise invisible gases. For these reasons we feel the potential of our core technology to grow in prevalence and importance is significant, particularly as the cost to produce the technology continues to decline.Thermal imaging systems are different than other types of “low light” night vision systems, such as visible light intensification systems used in green or gray sighted night vision goggles, because thermal imaging systems are not adversely affected by the presence of visible light, so they can be used day or night and are not susceptible to rapid changes in visible light levels. Thermal imaging systems are particularly well-suited for security applications involving the early detection of human activity due to the typically large temperature difference found between a human and the surrounding background.  Since infrared systems are detecting emitted infrared radiation, they are passive - and thus more covert than certain “active” or “illuminated” infrared systems. Additionally, thermal imaging systems have the ability to measure absolute temperatures remotely, a critical feature for a variety of commercial, industrial, and scientific applications.An infrared detector, which collects or absorbs infrared radiation and converts it into an electronic signal, is the primary component of thermal imaging systems. The two types of infrared detectors we manufacture and use in our systems are often referred to as “cooled” and “uncooled” detectors. Cooled detectors utilize a mechanical sterling cycle micro-cooler to reduce the operating temperature of the infrared sensor to approximately -200°C. These detectors offer very high sensitivity and spatial resolution for long-range applications or those applications requiring high measurement precision. Cooled detectors, while more sensitive and thus able to see farther, result in a product that is more expensive, heavier, more complex, and uses more power than those using uncooled detectors. Uncooled detectors operate at room temperature and do not require a micro-cooler, resulting in products that are lighter, use less power and are less expensive to produce than those using cooled detectors. The cost of both types of detectors is declining, and we expect to continue reducing costs as volumes rise and the technology advances.We have expertise in the calibration and repair of our products, and maintain service facilities at many locations worldwide. Each of our service facilities has the capability to perform the complex calibrations required to service thermal imaging systems. We also maintain field service capabilities under the direction of our independent representatives or distributors in certain locations outside the United States.As our customers have sought, and will continue to seek, new ways to address their needs and requirements in the most cost-effective and efficient manner, we have integrated thermal imaging with complementary technologies such as visible imaging, lasers, radar, and more. The following capabilities and disciplines are integrated into our business and processes:System Design and IntegrationWe have developed extensive competencies in the design and integration of numerous capabilities and payloads into integrated systems or sub-systems. Competencies such as stabilization, packaging and systems integration allow us to effectively combine a wide variety of technologies and payloads to suit our customers’ needs.  We strive to minimize the size, weight, power consumption, and cost in each of our product designs. 3RadiometryOur ability to produce thermal imaging systems that can accurately measure temperature remotely is critical in many of our Instruments segment markets. We have demonstrated know-how in designing and producing systems that can measure temperature to within very precise tolerances while maintaining accuracy and stability over time and over a wide range of ambient temperatures. We believe our skills in this area, known as thermal radiometry, offer an important competitive advantage over many of our competitors.Mechanical EngineeringThe design and production of thermal imaging systems involves highly sophisticated mechanical engineering techniques, particularly in the design and assembly of the supporting structures for system components such as detector arrays, micro-coolers, and optics. We also have expertise in designing stabilized assemblies used in our gimbal-mounted products utilizing precise electro-mechanical control, gyroscopes, electronic stabilization, and specialized optical control mechanisms.Infrared Detector Design ManufacturingWe design and manufacture both cooled and uncooled infrared detector arrays, in high volumes and at low costs. We believe our uncooled vanadium oxide microbolometers and cooled detectors using indium antimonide and indium gallium arsenide are among the highest performing infrared detectors of their type available in the world. Internal design and manufacturing of these detectors provides significant cost and engineering advantages compared with the use of external sources.Integrated Circuits and Electronic DesignWe have significant electronic design capabilities across several specialized areas, including readout-integrated circuit design, signal processing, image processing, and electronics integration. Our design expertise lies in the areas of reliability, low power consumption, and extreme environmental survivability. Software DevelopmentSoftware is an increasingly important aspect of our overall engineering and design activity. We offer networking capabilities, video analytics, and advanced firmware in our camera and other sensing systems. Many of our products are supported by a software eco-system that includes dedicated desktop and mobile platform applications.  Our products are typically developed with broad compatibility with common industry standards and protocols.Optical Design, Fabrication and CoatingWe design and manufacture sophisticated infrared optics using materials such as silicon, germanium, and zinc selenide that are required to produce a thermal imaging system. This capability allows us to rapidly develop optics optimized for use with our cameras and avoid costs and delays associated with reliance on third-party optics suppliers. We also have the capability to produce silicon wafer-level micro-optics at high volumes and the ability to apply custom multi-layer, vapor-deposited coatings to improve the transmission of the lens materials that are used in infrared systems.Micro-CoolersWe manufacture some of the industry’s smallest, lightest, and lowest power micro-coolers for use in cooling infrared detectors. Our coolers are especially effective in hand-held applications, where light weight and long battery life are essential.Lasers and Laser ComponentsMany of our more sophisticated systems are increasingly being offered with various types of laser payloads, including pointers, illuminators, rangefinders, and designators. We design and manufacture purpose-built laser rangefinders and designators for inclusion in some of our gimbaled multi-sensor systems. We also manufacture certain laser-related materials and components for external customers. 4Tactical PlatformsWe develop and manufacture comprehensive and integrated solutions for surveillance, assessment, and response. These platform solutions draw from our Surveillance and Detection products, as well as products sourced outside of the Company. These unmanned and manned networkable mobile and vehicle mounted systems can be deployed in nearly any environment and have provided security at borders, at theme parks, for police and military forces, at national monuments, and at high-profile events, both in the United States and internationally.RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENTOur success has been and will continue to be substantially affected by our ability to innovate new products and technologies that both augment our existing offerings and create new avenues for growth. We strive to differentiate ourselves from our competition with our research and development ("R&D") capabilities. Our internally funded R&D expenses were $132.9 million, $142.8 million, and $147.7 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We intend to continue to have significant internal R&D expenses in the future to provide a continuing flow of innovative and high-quality products to maintain and enhance our competitive position in each of our business segments. In addition to these internally funded activities, we engaged in R&D projects that were reimbursed by government agencies or prime contractors pursuant to development contracts we undertook. We believe our R&D capabilities are most efficiently deployed in a commercial environment, where we are free to innovate to meet market and customer needs, as such, the amount of externally funded R&D work that we undertake has been declining.COMPETITIVE STRENGTHSWith our decades of experience in developing and marketing infrared sensor products, we have built several unique competitive advantages that are core to our success.

We also intend to focus on continuous improvement through creating process efficiencies, building operational scale, and utilizing robust financial controls. We believe that these factors will ultimately generate superior long-term returns on investment for our shareholders. BUSINESS SEGMENTSSurveillance SegmentThe Surveillance segment develops and manufactures enhanced imaging and situational awareness solutions for a wide variety of military, law enforcement, public safety, and other government entities around the world. The segment also develops and sells hand-held and mounted scopes for consumers in the hunting and outdoors markets. Our solutions are used to protect borders, conduct search and rescue missions, gather intelligence, and protect critical infrastructure by providing the capability to see over long distances, day or night, through adverse weather conditions, through many obscurants, and from a wide variety of vehicle, man-portable, and fixed-installation platforms. Surveillance infrared imaging systems typically employ cooled infrared detector and numerous other imaging technologies to identify and track objects from long distances and at high resolution. The Surveillance segment also utilizes uncooled thermal technology to enable markets where size, weight, power consumption, and cost are important considerations. Uncooled Surveillance segment products include hand-held and tripod-mount monoculars and binoculars, weapon sights, and military-vehicle vision systems. We also design and manufacture lasers and laser components, such as rangefinders, illuminators, and target markers.Our customers require systems that operate in demanding environments such as extreme climatic conditions, battlefield and military environments, or maritime conditions. Systems are often installed onto larger platforms and must be able to integrate with other systems such as aircraft avionics, radars, remote weapon systems, laser systems, command and control centers, and large, broad-based security networks.We address our core markets through either a commercial, off-the-shelf ("COTS") model or a CDMQ model. The products we develop under the COTS model are applicable to a range of commercial and government customers and markets, including military applications. CDMQ products are specifically designed to meet military specifications. In both the COTS and CDMQ product development models, we use internally generated funds for research and development, and we generally own all rights to the products and their design.MarketsSearch and rescue Thermal imaging systems are used in airborne, shipborne, and land-based missions to rescue individuals in danger, distress, or who are wounded or lost in adverse conditions. These systems are in use today by organizations such as the United States Army, United States Air Force, United States Coast Guard, United States Marine Corps, United States Air National Guard, and many international customers.Force protection In instances where military or other personnel are deployed in hostile areas, thermal imaging systems and radars mounted on towers or other platforms are deployed to detect, identify, and defeat potential threats at an early stage. Our systems are deployed for this purpose by the United States Army, United States Marine Corps, and other organizations worldwide.8Border and maritime patrol          Our systems are used in airborne, shipborne, hand-held and fixed-installation applications for border and maritime surveillance, particularly at night, to enforce borders and monitor coastal waters, to support national fishing boundaries and to prevent smuggling. Our cameras are currently deployed along numerous borders worldwide, including in the United States, Europe, and the Middle East.Surveillance and reconnaissance  High-definition thermal imaging systems are used in surveillance and reconnaissance applications for the precise positioning of objects or people from substantial distances and for enhanced situational awareness, particularly at night or in conditions of reduced or obscured visibility. We also offer high-resolution, frequency-modulated, continuous-wave radars that enable wide-area surveillance capable of detecting potential threats before they cross a perimeter. These systems can be installed on fixed platforms, manned-mobile platforms, and unmanned aerial systems.Airborne law enforcement          We are a leader in the supply of stabilized airborne thermal imaging systems for federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. This type of equipment gives those agencies the ability to track suspects, locate lost persons, and provide situational awareness to officers on the ground. Targeting                 We offer several products that provide precise target location and designation capabilities in applications ranging from man-portable devices to high-definition, multi-spectral, stabilized airborne laser designator systems.Drug interdiction            Thermal imaging systems enable government agencies to expand their drug interdiction and support activities by allowing 24/7 wide-area surveillance and detection capabilities. Our systems are in use by the United States Customs Service, United States Drug Enforcement Agency and United States Federal Bureau of Investigation, as well as by similar foreign government agencies.Personal vision                We develop easy to use, affordable, and lightweight personal vision thermal cameras, such as monoculars and hunting scopes, that provide people the ability to see at night and stay safe in various settings. They enhance people’s enjoyment of the outdoors by enabling them to keep track of their camping party, see and track animals, and navigate during deteriorated weather conditions. We believe the personal vision systems market is very large and is becoming increasingly accessible as we reduce the price of advanced thermal imaging products.Sales and DistributionOur Surveillance business has a direct sales staff and a network of independent representatives and distributors covering major government markets worldwide. Included in this organization are technical and customer support staff in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia Pacific regions who provide application development, technical training, and operational assistance to direct and indirect sales personnel as well as to customers.The Surveillance segment typically has the highest backlog of our segments relative to revenue and in absolute terms.  At December 31, 2015, the Surveillance segment had a total backlog of $309 million.  Backlog represents orders that have been received for products, contract research and development, or other services for which a contractual agreement is in place and delivery or performance is expected to occur within 12 months.CustomersSurveillance segment customers generally consist of United States and foreign government agencies, including civilian, military, paramilitary, and police forces, as well as defense contractors and aircraft manufacturers. A substantial portion of Surveillance segment consolidated revenue is derived from sales to United States and foreign government agencies, and our business will continue to be substantially dependent upon such sales. We expect revenue outside the United States to continue to account for a significant portion of our Surveillance segment's revenue. The Surveillance segment is susceptible to some seasonality in its orders primarily based on the United States government budget year end. The result is that the third quarter tends to exhibit the largest amount of orders for our Surveillance segment. However, fiscal policy trends, increased revenue from outside the United States, budget delays, and general economic trends can overshadow this seasonality in any given year.9CompetitionThe Surveillance segment operates in a highly competitive market. Many of our competitors in the government sector are well-established contractors for various governments and have more financial and other resources than we possess. The principal competitive factors in the government markets include technical innovation, agency relationships, product quality and reliability, price, and ability to deliver. We believe we compete successfully in these markets with our best-in-class technologies, our products’ abilities to outperform customer requirements and competitors’ products, our lower-priced solutions that result from our CDMQ operating model, and our service and support functions that exist in the field and near the customer. Our current principal competitors in the Surveillance markets include divisions of BAE Systems, DRS (a Finmeccanica company), Elbit Systems, General Dynamics, L-3 Communications, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Sagem, Sofradir, and Thales.Instruments SegmentThe Instruments segment develops hand-held, fixed mount, and desktop imaging and measurement products. Thermal imaging camera products detect and measure heat and surface temperature differences, offering high accuracy, sophisticated diagnostic functionality, and a product range that spans a wide price spectrum. The Instruments segment's thermal cameras and related products are utilized by a growing number of industrial plant professionals, residential construction and contracting firms, energy production workers, manufacturing equipment and production line technicians, tradesmen, and homeowners. The Instruments segment offers a broad range of cooled and uncooled thermal products, with thermal cameras for laboratory and research and development applications; optical gas imagers for oil, power, and chemical production applications; highly ruggedized cameras for firefighters that are used for fire attack, overhaul, and search-and-rescue operations; fixed and pan-tilt thermal cameras for factory line automation and plant safety monitoring; and multiple lines of professional and mid-level thermal cameras for building analysis, predictive maintenance, and electrical systems analysis. Under our FLIR and Extech brands, the Instruments segment provides a comprehensive line of rugged and reliable test and measurement instruments, such as moisture meters, electrical test clamp meters, power analyzers, and multi-functional meters. These measurement instruments are used to evaluate electrical and environmental factors, including voltage, sound, light, heat index, and water quality. Leveraging our low-cost thermal sensors, we augment and enhance these familiar tools used in many industrial and commercial trades with Infrared Guided Measurement ("IGM"). IGM allows users to more efficiently address issues by first discovering via a thermal image the precise area of over-heating, moisture damage, or air ingress, allowing them to then apply the relevant sensor, such as voltage, current, spot temperature, or moisture probe, at the point of concern.MarketsBuilding and HVAC/R            Thermal imaging cameras are increasingly used by building and home inspectors, roofing specialists, plumbers, general contractors, and real estate firms to evaluate and measure the integrity of buildings by quickly revealing structural problems, such as air leaks and missing insulation, to help ensure efficient use of energy and other resources. Heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration ("HVAC/R") and mechanical contractors use thermal cameras and test and measurement equipment to ensure comfort in residences and workplaces by discovering, monitoring, and documenting airflow, leaks, and temperatures in ductwork and other forms of heating/cooling distribution systems.  Hand-held test and measurement tools are used to measure airflow, humidity, carbon monoxide levels, light, sound, and other environmental factors. Electrical            Electricians and mechanical technicians utilize thermal cameras and test and measurement equipment to quickly conduct electrical diagnostics, such as identifying circuit overloads, finding loose wire connections, and measuring currents, all without having to touch dangerous components. From overheating electrical circuits to corroded connections, thermal cameras and test meters provide the diagnostic functions needed to verify correct installations, quickly trace the source of problems, and enable efficient electrical systems.  Hand-held test and measurement tools are used to measure currents, voltage, resistance, continuity, and other electrical parameters.Predictive maintenance        Thermal imaging systems are used for monitoring the condition of mechanical and electrical equipment. Such monitoring enables factory and plant maintenance technicians to quickly reveal equipment faults, manifested as hot or cold spots, so they can be 10repaired before they fail. This increases equipment productivity and avoids catastrophic failures or major damage, which reduces operating expenses by lowering repair costs and reducing downtime. Improved functionality of image analysis software, smaller size and weight, and simplicity of system operation are critical factors for this well-established market segment.  Hand-held test and measurement tools are used to measure airflow, humidity, carbon monoxide levels, sound, vibration and other environmental factors.Firefighting                 Thermal imaging is a well-known technology in the firefighting market, with firefighters and first responders worldwide utilizing thermal imaging cameras for protecting their own life and saving the lives of others. Thermal imaging technology allows first responders to assess conditions of a space prior to and after entry by providing them the ability to see through most forms of smoke. This also allows them to search for people and animals and identify fire hot spots in burning buildings or smoke filled environments. Providing the ability to measure temperatures in a non-contact mode from a safe distance helps firefighters to protect themselves against dangerous phenomena like roll-overs and flash-overs. Research and science            High-end thermal imaging systems provide the unique ability to detect very small differences in temperature. This capability is useful in industrial R&D, where developers study, see, and quantify the heat dissipation, stress tolerance, and thermal characteristics of their materials, components, and products. At colleges and universities, instructors use thermal imagery to help students visualize the theories of heat transfer and thermodynamics, improving student comprehension of key concepts, and for both fundamental and applied research. In the defense sector, cooled thermal imaging cameras are used in the development of firearms, ammunition, guided missiles, and aircraft. Oil and gas production             Thermal imaging cameras can visualize and pinpoint certain gas leaks. In industrial, utility, and oil and gas refinery settings, optical gas imagers visually reveal plumes of gases such as SF6 (Sulfur Hexafluoride), hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide from a safe distance. Optical gas imaging cameras can continuously scan installations in remote areas or in zones that are difficult to access. Continuous monitoring allows the user to be informed when a dangerous or costly gas leak appears. Typical examples are monitoring pipelines, petrochemical industry and offshore operations.Manufacturing process control        Temperature consistency is critical to the quality of many manufactured components, materials, and products, including metals, plastics, paper, and glass. Thermal cameras, both fixed and mobile, help factories ensure product quality and identify other defects in both products and in the manufacturing process itself through the continuous monitoring of the production line, resulting in higher output and nearly perfect quality control. Other users of thermal cameras in the manufacturing sectors include worker safety and fire prevention, analysis of welding and fastening effectiveness, food inspection, packaging quality, and electronic and mechanical component manufacturing, ranging in size from small hybrid integrated circuits to jet engines.

GOVERNMENT REGULATIONThermal technology is controlled for export, re-export and retransfer by the United States government. Depending on the technology, the export of infrared products may be controlled by the United States Department of State or the Bureau of Industry and Security. In general, the more sophisticated the technology and the higher the performance of the product, the more restrictive are the licensing requirements. Licensing requirements differ from country to country, end user to end user and differ with product performance and field of intended use.  The export of some of our products are controlled by the International Traffic and Arms Regulation ("ITAR"). As a United States government supplier, we must comply with specific procurement regulations and other requirements and are subject to routine audits and investigations by United States government agencies. If we fail to comply with these rules and regulations, the results could include: reductions in the value of contracts; contract modifications or termination; the assessment of penalties and fines; and/or suspension or debarment from United States government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time or permanently.18EMPLOYEESAs of December 31, 2015, we had 3,003 employees of which 1,726 were located in the United States and 1,277 located outside of the United States. We have generally been successful in attracting highly skilled technical, marketing, and management personnel. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a union or other bargaining group. Certain employees in Europe are represented by unions and workers councils whose contracts are subject to periodic renegotiations. We believe our relationships with our employees, unions and workers councils are generally good.ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERSOur operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of certain materials, substances, and wastes used in our operations. We continually assess our obligations and compliance with respect to these requirements. We have also assessed the risk for environmental contamination for our various manufacturing facilities, including our acquired businesses and facilities and, where appropriate, have obtained indemnification from the sellers of those businesses and facilities.We believe that our current operations are in substantial compliance with all existing applicable environmental laws and permits.

Historically, these costs have not been material.AVAILABLE INFORMATIONOur Internet website address is www.flir.com. This Report, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and other required filings are available through our Internet website as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our Internet website and the information contained therein or connected thereto are not intended to be incorporated into this Report.19ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS The following are important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. If we are unable to adequately respond to these risks and uncertainties, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, we cannot be certain or give any assurance that any actions taken to reduce known risks and uncertainties will be effective. Risks, Uncertainties and Other Factors Related to Our BusinessWe depend on the United States government for a material portion of our business and changes in government spending could adversely affect our businessWe derive significant revenue from contracts or subcontracts funded by United States government agencies. A significant reduction in the purchase of our products by these agencies or contractors for these agencies would have an adverse effect on our business. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, approximately 20 percent, 20 percent and 24 percent, respectively, of our revenues were derived directly or indirectly from sales to the United States government and its agencies. The funding of contracts awarded to us depends on the overall United States government budget and appropriations process, which is beyond our control. In addition, at its discretion, the United States government may change its spending priorities and/or terminate, reduce or modify contracts.Substantial uncertainty exists in the spending levels and priorities of the United States government, particularly with respect to military expenditures. Continued and further reductions in military spending could have a material adverse effect on our results from operations.As a United States government supplier, we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulationsGovernment contractors must comply with specific procurement regulations and other requirements and are subject to routine audits and investigations by United States government agencies.  In addition, violations of unrelated laws and statutes can lead to debarment and other penalties.  If we fail to comply with procurement rules and regulations and other laws and statutes, the results could include: reductions in the value of contracts; contract modifications or termination; the assessment of penalties and fines; and/or suspension or debarment from United States government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time or permanently.   An adverse action by the United States government could also result in lost sales to non-governmental customers who might disqualify us as a result of such adverse action.Operating margins may be negatively impacted by reduction in sales or by a change in the mix of products soldOur expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations regarding future sales and these expenses are largely fixed in the short term. Some expenses, such as those related to research and development activities, would likely be maintained in the event of a sales downturn in order to maintain and enhance the long-term competitiveness of the Company. We maintain inventories of finished goods, components and raw materials at levels we believe are necessary to meet anticipated sales. Accordingly, we may not be able to reduce our costs in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall between forecasted and actual sales. Any significant shortfall of sales may result in us carrying higher levels of inventories of finished goods, components and raw materials thereby increasing our risk of inventory obsolescence and corresponding inventory write-downs and write-offs. Our fixed costs, including facilities and information technology costs, compliance and public company costs, and depreciation and amortization related to previous acquisitions and capital expenditures, are significant and are difficult to reduce in the short term. Our operating margins vary by product and substantial changes in the mix of products sold could also have a negative impact on our operating margins.We may experience impairment in the value of our tangible and intangible assetsOur industry is subject to rapid changes in technology, which may result in unexpected obsolescence or impairment of our assets. As of December 31, 2015, our intangible assets, including goodwill, totaled $737.6 million and represented approximately 31 percent of our total assets. Most of these intangibles are the result of acquisitions in which the purchase price exceeded the value of the tangible assets acquired. We amortize certain of these intangibles over their anticipated useful life and review goodwill for 20impairment annually or more frequently if warranted by events. To date we have not experienced any impairment of our intangible assets, but there can be no assurance that we will not experience such impairment in the future. In addition, certain of our tangible assets such as inventory and machinery and equipment may experience impairment in their value as a result of such events as the introduction of new products, changes in technology or changes in customer demand patterns. We depreciate our machinery and equipment at levels we believe are adequate; however, there can be no assurance that there will not be a future impairment that may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We face risks from international sales and business activitiesWe market and sell our products worldwide and international sales have accounted for, and are expected to continue to account for, a significant portion of our revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, international sales accounted for 47 percent, 49 percent and 50 percent, respectively, of our total revenue. We also manufacture certain products and subassemblies in Europe and we have several contract manufacturing agreements with third parties in Europe and in Asia. Our international business activities are subject to a number of risks, including:•the imposition of and changes to governmental licensing restrictions and controls impacting our technology and products;•restrictions and prohibitions on the export of  technology and products;•trade restrictions;•difficulty in collecting receivables and governmental restrictions with respect to currency;•inadequate protection of intellectual property;•labor union activities;•changes in tariffs and taxes;•restrictions on repatriation of earnings;•restriction on the importation and exportation of goods and services;•risks, costs, impacts and obligations associated with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws applicable to us, and costs and penalties from violations of such laws and related regulations;•difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and•political and economic instability.No assurance can be given that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future international sales and operations and, consequently, on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Furthermore, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include import and export laws, anti-competition laws, anti-corruption laws, such as the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, data privacy requirements, tax laws, and accounting, internal control and disclosure requirements. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal fines, penalties and sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our reputation, business and results of operations. In certain foreign jurisdictions, there is a higher risk of fraud or corruption and greater difficulty in maintaining effective internal controls and compliance programs. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies or applicable laws and regulations.  In addition, our international contracts may include industrial cooperation agreements requiring specific in-country purchases, investments, manufacturing agreements or other financial obligations, known as offset obligations, and may provide for penalties if we fail to meet such requirements. The impact of these factors is difficult to predict, but one or more of them could have a material adverse affect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.We face risks from currency fluctuationsHistorically, currency fluctuations have affected our operating results. Changes in the value of foreign currencies in which our sales or costs incurred are denominated have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, fluctuations in our operating results. We seek to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations by denominating, where possible, our international sales in United States dollars, by balancing expenses and revenues in various currencies and by undertaking limited hedging of forecasted currency 21exposures. With respect to international sales denominated in United States dollars, a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar could make our products less price competitive. We may not be successful in obtaining the necessary export licenses to conduct operations abroad and the United States government may prevent proposed sales to foreign governments and customersExport and other licenses are required from United States government agencies under the ITAR, the Export Administration Act, the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, and the Arms Export Control Act of 1976 and other similar laws and regulations for the sale, use and export of many of our products. We can give no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining these licenses. The aftermath of 9/11, the rise of terrorism and the changing geopolitical environment, and heightened tensions with other countries (which shift and evolve over time), has led to heightened government scrutiny of export licenses for products in our markets and has resulted in lengthened review periods for our license applications, including in countries where we have historically made significant sales. Failure to obtain or delays in obtaining these licenses would prevent or delay us from selling our products outside the United States and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.General economic conditions may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial conditionOur operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of capital investment and consumer spending. Economic factors that could adversely influence demand for the Company’s products include uncertainty about global economic conditions leading to reduced levels of investment, changes in government spending levels and/or priorities, the size and availability of government budgets, customers’ and suppliers’ access to credit, consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting government, industrial or consumer spending behavior.In recent years, our performance has been negatively impacted by reduced spending by United States government agencies, global economic weakness, and the Eurozone crisis. Continuation of the conditions that led to reduced spending and potential further reductions in spending globally by either consumers or government agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our primary markets are volatile and unpredictableOur business depends on the demand for our products and solutions in a variety of commercial, industrial and government markets. In the past, the demand for our products in these markets has fluctuated due to a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:•the timing, number and size of orders from, and shipments to, our customers, as well as the relative mix of those orders;•variations in the volume of orders for a particular product or product line in a particular fiscal quarter;•the size and timing of new contract awards;•the timing of the release of government funds for procurement of our products; and•the timing of orders and shipments within a given fiscal quarter.Seasonal fluctuations in our operating results result from:•the seasonal pattern of contracting by the United States government and certain foreign governments;•the desire of customers to take delivery of equipment prior to fiscal year ends due to funding considerations; and•the tendency of commercial enterprises to fully utilize annual capital budgets prior to expiration.Competition in our markets is intense and our failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our businessCompetition in the markets for our products is intense. The speed with which companies can identify new applications for thermal imaging, develop products to meet those needs and supply commercial quantities at low prices to the market are important competitive factors. We believe the principal competitive factors in our markets are product performance, price, customer service and training, product reputation, and effective marketing and sales efforts. Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, research and development, and marketing resources than we do. All of these factors, as well as the potential for increased competition from new market entrants, require us to continue to invest in, and focus on, research and development and new product innovation. 22No assurance can be given that we will be able to compete effectively in the future and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our products may suffer from defects or errors leading to substantial product liability, damage or warranty claimsWe include complex system designs and components in our products that may contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products or release new versions. If any of our products are defective, we might be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. Such an event could result in significant expenses including expenses arising from product liability and warranty claims, disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As we expand our presence into new markets, we may face increased exposure to product liability claims. We maintain product liability insurance but cannot be certain that it will be sufficient or will continue to be available on acceptable terms.Risks, Uncertainties and Other Factors Related to Our Technology and Intellectual PropertyOur inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights and avoid infringing the rights of others could harm our competitive position and our businessOur ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing the rights of others. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. Many of our proprietary rights are held in confidence as trade secrets and are not covered by patents, making them more difficult to protect. Although we currently hold worldwide patents covering certain aspects of our technologies and products, and we are actively pursuing additional patents, we cannot be certain that we will obtain additional patents or trademarks on our technology, products and trade names. Furthermore, we cannot be certain that our patents or trademarks will not be challenged or circumvented by our competitors or that measures taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will adequately deter their misappropriation or disclosure. Any failure by us to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, because intellectual property does not necessarily prevent our competitors from entering the markets we serve, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our competitive advantage or that our competitors will not develop capabilities equal or superior to ours.Litigation over patents and other intellectual property is common in our industry. We have been the subject of patent and other intellectual property litigation in the past and cannot be sure that we will not be subject to such litigation in the future. Similarly, there exists the possibility we will assert claims in litigation to protect our intellectual property. Lawsuits defending or prosecuting intellectual property claims and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort of our personnel. An adverse determination in a patent suit or in any other proceeding in which we are a party could subject us to significant liabilities, result in the loss of intellectual property rights we claim or impact our competitive position. Additionally, an adverse determination could require us to seek licenses from third parties. If such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Our future success will depend on our ability to respond to the rapid technological change in the markets in which we compete, our ability to introduce new or enhanced products and enter into new marketsThe markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological developments and frequent new product introductions, enhancements and modifications. Our ability to develop new products and technologies that anticipate changing customer requirements, reduce costs and otherwise retain or enhance our competitive position in existing and new markets will be an important factor in our future results from operations. We will continue to make substantial capital expenditures and incur significant research and development costs to improve our manufacturing capability, reduce costs, and develop and introduce new products and enhancements. If we fail to develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. In addition, we cannot be certain that our new products and technologies will be successful or that customers will accept any of our new products.23Our business could be negatively impacted by cybersecurity threats and other security threats and technology disruptionsWe face certain security threats and technology disruptions, including threats to our information technology infrastructure, attempts to gain access to our or our customers’ proprietary or classified information, threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees, threats of terrorism events, and failures of our technology tools and systems.  We are subject to laws and rules issued by various agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining infrastructure and physical security and information confidentiality.  Our information technology networks and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to successfully perform day-to-day operations.  We are also involved with information technology systems for certain customers and other third parties, for which we face similar security threats as for our own.  In particular, cybersecurity threats-which include, but are not limited to, computer viruses, spyware and malware, attempts to access information, denial of service attacks and other electronic security breaches-are persistent and evolve quickly.  Such threats have increased in frequency, scope and potential impact in recent years.  Further, a variety of technological tools and systems, including both company-owned information technology and technological services provided by outside parties, support our critical functions.  These technologies, as well as our products, are subject to failure and the user’s inability to have such technologies properly supported, updated, expanded or integrated into other technologies and may contain open source and third party software which may unbeknownst to us contain defects or viruses that pose unintended risks to our customers.  These risks if not effectively mitigated or controlled could materially harm our business or reputation.  While we believe that we have implemented appropriate measures and controls, there can be no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent disruptions to critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential information or corruption of data.  We require user names and passwords in order to access our information technology systems.  We use encryption and authentication technologies designed to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to our data or accounts.  These security measures are subject to third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularities.  For example, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems.  These security systems cannot provide absolute security.  To the extent we were to experience a breach of our systems and were unable to protect sensitive data, such a breach could materially damage business partner and customer relationships, and curtail or otherwise impact the use of our information technology systems.  Moreover, if a security breach of our information technology system affects our computer systems or results in the release of personally identifiable or other sensitive information of customers, business partners, employees and other third parties, our reputation and brand could be materially damaged, use of our products and services could decrease, and we could be exposed to a risk of loss, litigation and potential liability.Although we have in the past and continue to be subject to cybersecurity threats and other security threats and technology disruptions, to date none has had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.  Nonetheless, in the future, these types of events could disrupt our operations and customer and other third party information technology systems.  They also could require significant management attention and resources, negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public and challenge our eligibility for future work on sensitive or classified systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks, Uncertainties and Other Factors Related to Our Corporate Structure and OrganizationOur future success depends in part on attracting and retaining key senior management and qualified technical, sales and other personnelOur future success depends in part on the efforts and continued services of our key executives and our ability to attract and retain qualified technical, sales and other personnel. Significant competition exists for such personnel and we cannot assure the retention of our key executives, technical and sales personnel or our ability to attract, integrate and retain other such personnel that may be required in the future. We cannot assure that employees will not leave and subsequently compete against us. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.We must successfully manage a complex global organizationAs we have grown, the size and scope of our worldwide operations have also increased substantially. We currently design, manufacture and market numerous product lines in locations worldwide. Significant management time and effort is required to 24effectively manage the increased complexity of the business and our failure to successfully do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our inability to continue to manufacture our products at one or more of our facilities as a result of, for example, a prolonged power outage, earthquake, fire or other natural disaster, or labor or political unrest, could prevent us from supplying products to our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may be unable to successfully integrate recent or future acquisitions into our operations, thereby disrupting our business and harming our financial condition and results of operationsWe have made ten acquisitions of various sizes in the past five years. The integration of businesses, personnel, product lines and technologies can be difficult, time consuming and subject to significant risks. For example, we could lose key personnel from companies that we acquire, incur unanticipated costs, lose major sources of revenue, fail to integrate critical technologies, suffer business disruptions, fail to capture anticipated synergies, fail to establish satisfactory internal controls, or incur unanticipated liabilities. Any of these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and decrease our revenue.We frequently evaluate strategic opportunities available to us and it is likely that we will make additional acquisitions in the future. Such acquisitions may vary in size and complexity. Any future acquisitions are subject to the risks described above. Furthermore, we might assume or incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities to pay for future acquisitions. Additional debt may negatively impact our results and increase our financial risk, and the issuance of any additional equity securities could dilute our then existing shareholders’ ownership. No assurance can be given that we will realize anticipated benefits of any future acquisitions, or that any such acquisition or investment will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We have indebtedness as a result of the issuance of our 3.75 percent senior unsecured notes (the “Notes”) and borrowings against our term loan, and we are subject to certain restrictive covenants under our unsecured credit facility and the indenture governing the Notes which may limit our operational and financial flexibilityOur ability to meet our debt service obligations and comply with the financial covenants under our credit facility will be dependent upon our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. Our inability to meet our debt service obligations or comply with the required covenants could result in a default under the credit facility or indenture. In the event of any such default, under the credit facility, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all outstanding debt, accrued interest and fees under the facility to be due and immediately payable. In the event of any such default under our indenture, either the trustee or the holders of at least 25 percent of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes could declare the principal amount of all of the Notes to be due and payable immediately.We may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms, if at all. Our inability to refinance our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ongoing results of operations.Our ability to refinance indebtedness, including the Notes which we expect to refinance in 2016, will depend in part on our operating and financial performance, which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. In addition, prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing could increase our interest expense. A refinancing of our indebtedness, including the Notes, could also require us to comply with more onerous covenants and further restrict our business operations. Our inability to refinance our indebtedness or to do so upon attractive terms could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and make us vulnerable to adverse industry and general economic conditions.Changes in our effective income tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results of operationsWe are subject to taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Belgium, where a number of our subsidiaries are organized.  Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change.  Our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the enforcement environment, and changes in tax laws or their interpretations, including in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. For example, in January 2016, the European 25Commission announced a decision concluding that certain rules under Belgian tax legislation are deemed to be incompatible with European Union regulations on “state aid.” As a result of this decision, the European Commission has directed the Belgian Government to recover past taxes from certain entities, which we expect to include one of our Belgian subsidiaries regarding the amount of taxes applicable to us during a three year period ending in July 2015. Negotiations are ongoing between the Belgian Government and the European Commission to agree on a methodology to calculate the applicable amounts for each company impacted by the decision. Furthermore, the decision may be appealed before the General Court of the European Union by the Belgian Government and by companies which are directly affected by the decision. Although no demand for payment or other official notice has been received by us to date, we are currently reviewing the matter, including the potential impact to the 2016 tax provision, and expect to take actions necessary to preserve our rights, including reducing or eliminating the amount determined to be “state aid.” We expect that the ultimate amount owed, if any, will be determined after litigation and/or negotiation and such amount could be material. Our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of additional factors including:•the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;•the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities;•changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;•adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns;•increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes;•changes in available tax credits;•changes in share-based compensation expense;•changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles;•changes in foreign tax rates or agreed upon foreign taxable base; and/or•the repatriation of earnings from outside the United States for which we have not previously provided for United States taxes.Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact net income for future periods. In addition, the United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns. Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if any assessments resulting from the examination of our income tax returns by the IRS or other taxing authorities are not resolved in our favor.State of Oregon law and our charter documents contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover, even if the transaction would benefit our shareholdersOther companies may seek to acquire or merge with us. An acquisition or merger of our Company could result in benefits to our shareholders, including an increase in the value of our common stock. Some provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, including our ability to issue preferred stock without further action by our shareholders, as well as provisions of the State of Oregon law, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable.ITEM 1B
