ITEM 1A. Risk Factors




The risks described below could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and/or the trading price of our common stock.  Although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, they may include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below.  Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material to our operations.  You should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties.  The order in which these factors appear should not be construed to indicate their relative importance or priority.




The health care products distribution industry is highly competitive and consolidating and we may not be able to compete successfully.




We compete with numerous companies, including several major manufacturers and distributors.  Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do, which could allow them to compete more successfully.  Most of our products are available from several sources and our customers tend to have relationships with several distributors.  Competitors could obtain exclusive rights to market particular products, which we would then be unable to market.  Manufacturers also could increase their efforts to sell directly to end-users and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors.  Industry consolidation among health care product distributors, price competition, the unavailability of products, whether due to our inability to gain access to products or to interruptions in supply from manufacturers, or the emergence of new competitors also could increase competition.  There has also been increasing consolidation among manufacturers of health care products which could have a material adverse effect on our margins and product availability.  Additionally, in this competitive market, some of our contracts contain minimum purchase commitments.  We could be subject to charges and financial losses in the event we fail to satisfy minimum purchase commitments.  In the future, we may be unable to compete successfully and competitive pressures may reduce our revenues and profitability.




Because substantially all of the products that we distribute are not manufactured by us, we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of substantially all of our products.




We obtain substantially all of our products from third parties.  Generally, we do not have long-term contracts with our suppliers committing them to supply products to us.  Therefore, suppliers may not provide the products we need in the quantities we request.  While there is generally more than one source of supply for most of the categories of products we sell, some key suppliers, in the aggregate, supply a significant portion of the products we sell.  Additionally, because we generally do not control the actual production of the products we sell, we may be subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside of our control, including the failure to comply with applicable government requirements.  The failure of manufacturers of products regulated by the FDA or other governmental agencies to meet these requirements could result in product recall, cessation of sales or other market disruptions.  In the event that any of our third-party suppliers were to become unable or unwilling to continue to provide the products in required volumes, we would need to identify and obtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely basis.  There is no guarantee that we would be able to obtain such alternative sources of supply on a timely basis, if at all.  An extended interruption in the supply of our products, especially any high sales volume product, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, which most likely would adversely affect the value of our common stock.

Our revenues and profitability depend on our relationships with capable sales personnel as well as customers, suppliers and manufacturers of the products that we distribute.




Our future revenues and profitability depend on our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with qualified sales personnel as well as customers, suppliers and manufacturers.  If we fail to maintain our existing relationships with such persons or fail to acquire relationships with such key persons in the future, our business may be materially adversely affected.




Our future success is substantially dependent upon our senior management.




Our future success is substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of members of our existing senior management, particularly Stanley M. Bergman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, among others.  The loss of the services of Mr. Bergman could have a material adverse effect on our business.  We have an employment agreement with Mr. Bergman.  We do not currently have “key man” life insurance policies on any of our employees.  Competition for senior management is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel.




We experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings.  As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.




Our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations.  Revenues and profitability generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products (including influenza vaccine, equipment and software products), purchasing patterns of office-based health care practitioners and year-end promotions.  Revenues and profitability generally have been lower in the first quarter, primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters.  We expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future.  Quarterly results may also be materially adversely affected by a variety of other factors, including:








•

  

timing and amount of sales and marketing expenditures;











•

  

timing of pricing changes offered by our suppliers;











•

  

timing of the introduction of new products and services by our suppliers;











•

  

timing of the release of upgrades and enhancements to our technology-related products and services;











•

  

changes in or availability of supplier contracts or rebate programs;











•

  

supplier rebates based upon attaining certain growth goals;











•

  

changes in the way suppliers introduce or deliver products to market;











•

  

costs of developing new applications and services;











•

  

our ability to correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences;











•

  

uncertainties regarding potential significant breaches of data security or disruptions of our information technology systems;











•

  

unexpected regulatory actions, or government regulation generally;











•

  

exclusivity requirements with certain suppliers may prohibit us from distributing competitive products manufactured by other suppliers;











•

  

loss of sales representatives;











•

  

costs related to acquisitions and/or integrations of technologies or businesses;

•

  

costs associated with our self-insured medical and dental insurance programs;











•

  

general market and economic conditions, as well as those specific to the health care industry and related industries;











•

  

our success in establishing or maintaining business relationships;











•

  

unexpected difficulties in developing and manufacturing products;











•

  

product demand and availability or recalls by manufacturers;











•

  

exposure to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury;











•

  

increases in shipping costs or service issues with our third-party shippers;











•

  

fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies;











•

  

restructuring costs;











•

  

the adoption or repeal of legislation; and











•

  

changes in accounting principles.







Any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly financial results to fluctuate.  If our financial results do not meet market expectations, our stock price may decline.




Expansion of group purchasing organizations (“GPO”) or provider networks and the multi-tiered costing structure may place us at a competitive disadvantage.




The medical products industry is subject to a multi-tiered costing structure, which can vary by manufacturer and/or product. Under this structure, certain institutions can obtain more favorable prices for medical products than we are able to obtain. The multi-tiered costing structure continues to expand as many large integrated health care providers and others with significant purchasing power, such as GPOs, demand more favorable pricing terms. Additionally, the formation of provider networks and GPOs may shift purchasing decisions to entities or persons with whom we do not have a historical relationship. This may threaten our ability to compete effectively, which would in turn negatively impact our financial results. Although we are seeking to obtain similar terms from manufacturers, obtain access to lower prices demanded by GPO contracts or other contracts, and develop relationships with provider networks and new GPOs, we cannot assure that such terms will be obtained or contracts will be executed.




Increases in shipping costs or service issues with our third-party shippers could harm our business.




Shipping is a significant expense in the operation of our business.  We ship almost all of our orders through third-party delivery services, and typically bear the cost of shipment.  Accordingly, any significant increase in shipping rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.  Similarly, strikes or other service interruptions by those shippers could cause our operating expenses to rise and materially adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis.

Uncertain global macro-economic and political conditions could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.




Uncertain global macro-economic and political conditions that affect the economy and the economic outlook of the United States, Europe and other parts of the world could adversely affect our customers and suppliers, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. These uncertainties, including, among other things, sovereign debt levels, the inability of political institutions to effectively resolve actual or perceived economic, currency or budgetary crises or issues, consumer confidence, election results, unemployment levels (and a corresponding increase in the uninsured and underinsured population), interest rates, availability of capital, fuel and energy costs, tax rates, health care costs and the threat or outbreak of terrorism or public unrest, could adversely impact our customers and suppliers, which could materially adversely affect us.  Changes in government, government debt and/or budget crises may lead to reductions in government spending in certain countries, which could reduce overall health care spending, and/or higher income or corporate taxes, which could depress spending overall.  Additionally, recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending may cause customers to reduce, modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may cause suppliers to reduce their output or change their terms of sale.  We generally sell products to customers with payment terms.  If customers’ cash flow or operating and financial performance deteriorates, or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment to us.  Likewise, for similar reasons suppliers may restrict credit or impose different payment terms.  Any inability of current and/or potential customers to pay us for our products and/or services or any demands by suppliers for different payment terms may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.




Disruptions in the financial markets may materially adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us.




Our ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors beyond our control.  Disruptions in the financial markets may materially adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us.




The market price for our common stock may be highly volatile.




The market price for our common stock may be highly volatile.  A variety of factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock, including:








•

  

the publication of earnings estimates or other research reports and speculation in the press or investment community;











•

  

changes in our industry and competitors;











•

  

changes in government or legislation;











•

  

our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and prospects;











•

  

stock repurchases;











•

  

any future issuances of our common stock, which may include primary offerings for cash, stock splits, issuances in connection with business acquisitions, issuances of restricted stock/units and the grant or exercise of stock options from time to time;











•

  

general market and economic conditions; and











•

  

any outbreak or escalation of hostilities in areas where we do business.







In addition, the NASDAQ Stock Market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on NASDAQ.  Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of actual operating performance.  In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies.  This type of litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

The health care industry is experiencing changes that could materially adversely affect our business.




The health care industry is highly regulated and subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences.  In recent years, the health care industry has undergone, and is in the process of undergoing, significant changes driven by various efforts to reduce costs, including: trends toward managed care; consolidation of health care distribution companies; consolidation of health care manufacturers; collective purchasing arrangements and consolidation among office-based health care practitioners; and changes in reimbursements to customers, as well as growing enforcement activities (and related monetary recoveries) by governmental officials.  Both our profitability and the profitability of our customers may be materially adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals and/or medical treatments or services, changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined and, in the case of animal health practitioners, changes in the use of feed additives (including, without limitation, antibiotics and growth promotants) used in the production of animal products due to trade restrictions, animal welfare and/or government regulations; and changes in customer buying habits (including customers purchasing animal health pharmaceuticals outside the veterinarians’ offices).  If we are unable to react effectively to these and other changes in the health care industry, our financial results could be materially adversely affected.




The implementation of the Health Care Reform Law could materially adversely affect our business.




The United States Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, each enacted in March 2010, generally known as the Health Care Reform Law, significantly expand health insurance coverage to uninsured Americans and changes the way health care is financed by both governmental and private payers.  We expect expansion of access to health insurance to increase the demand for our products and services, but other provisions of the Health Care Reform Law could have a material adverse effect on our business, and the Health Care Reform Law may be invalidated, in whole or in part, or it may be repealed.  Additionally, further federal and state proposals for health care reform in the United States are likely, and foreign government authorities may also adopt reforms of their health systems.  We cannot predict what further reform proposals, if any, will be adopted, when they may be adopted, or what impact they may have on us.




The Health Care Reform Law contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and to reduce costs of Medicare and Medicaid, including imposing a 2.3% excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers and importers that began in 2013, and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics that was implemented in 2011, both of which may adversely affect sales and cost of goods sold.  As part of H.R. 2029 – Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 a moratorium was imposed on the Medical Device Excise Tax for the period beginning January 1, 2016 and ending on December 31, 2017.  As such, the Medical Device Excise Tax does not apply to sales during that period. 




The implementation of the reporting and disclosure obligations of the Physician Payment Sunshine Act provisions of the Health Care Reform Law could adversely affect our business.




A Health Care Reform Law provision, generally referred to as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act or Open Payments Program, imposes reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain practitioners (including physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals), and for such manufacturers and for group purchasing organizations, with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity.  On February 1, 2013, CMS released the final rule to implement the Physician Payment Sunshine Act.  Under this rule, data collection activities (which began on August 1, 2013) as required under the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, CMS publishes information from these reports on a publicly available website, including amounts transferred and physician, dentist and teaching hospital identities.  Under the Physician Payment Sunshine Act we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals, and we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable Physician Payment Sunshine Act requirements.  The Physician Payment Sunshine Act pre-empts similar state reporting laws, although we or our subsidiaries may also be required to report under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and some of these state laws, as well as the federal law, can be ambiguous.  We are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers.  While we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with these reporting requirements, our compliance with these new rules imposes additional costs on us.

Failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could materially adversely affect our business.




Our business is subject to requirements under various local, state, federal and international laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and human cells, tissue and cellular and tissue-based products, also known as HCT/P products, and animal feed and supplements.  Among the federal laws with which we must comply are the Controlled Substances Act, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and Section 361 of the Public Health Services Act.  Among other things, such laws, and the regulations promulgated thereunder:








•

  

regulate the storage and distribution, labeling, packaging, handling, reporting, record keeping, introduction, manufacturing and marketing of drugs, HCT/P products and medical devices;











•

  

subject us to inspection by the FDA and the DEA;











•

  

regulate the storage, transportation and disposal of certain of our products that are considered hazardous materials;











•

  

require us to advertise and promote our drugs and devices in accordance with applicable FDA requirements;











•

  

require registration with the FDA and the DEA and various state agencies;











•

  

require record keeping and documentation of transactions involving drug products;











•

  

require us to design and operate a system to identify and report suspicious orders of controlled substances to the DEA;











•

  

require us to manage returns of products that have been recalled and subject us to inspection of our recall procedures and activities; and











•

  

impose reporting requirements if a pharmaceutical, HCT/P product or medical device causes serious illness, injury or death.







Applicable federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations also may require us to meet various standards relating to, among other things, licensure or registration, sales and marketing practices, product integrity and supply tracking to the manufacturer of the product, personnel, privacy and security of health or other personal information, installation, maintenance and repair of equipment, and the importation and exportation of products.  Our business also is subject to requirements of similar and other foreign governmental laws and regulations affecting our operations abroad.  The FDA and DEA have recently increased their regulatory and enforcement activities.




The failure to comply with any of these regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, or the imposition of any additional laws and regulations, could materially adversely affect our business.  There can be no assurance that current government regulations will not adversely affect our business.  The costs to us associated with complying with the various applicable statutes and regulations, as they now exist and as they may be modified, could be material.  Allegations by a governmental body that we have not complied with these laws could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.  If it is determined that we have not complied with these laws, we are potentially subject to penalties including warning letters, civil and criminal penalties, mandatory recall of product, seizure of product and injunction, consent decrees, and suspension or limitation of product sale and distribution.  If we enter into settlement agreements to resolve allegations of non-compliance, we could be required to make settlement payments or be subject to civil and criminal penalties, including fines and the loss of licenses.  Non-compliance with government requirements could adversely affect our ability to participate in federal and state government health care programs, and damage our reputation.

If we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to health care fraud or other laws and regulations, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations, which could materially adversely affect our business.

 

Certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state (and similar foreign) health care fraud and abuse, referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations.  Some of these laws, referred to as “false claims laws,” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal, state and other health care payers and programs.  Other laws, referred to as “anti-kickback laws,” prohibit soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering, purchasing, leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering, purchasing or leasing, of items or services that are paid for by federal, state and other health care payers and programs.  Health care fraud measures may implicate, for example, our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers, our pricing and incentive programs for physician and dental practices, and our dental and physician practice management products that offer billing-related functionality.




The fraud and abuse regulations have been subject to varying interpretations, as well as heightened enforcement activity, over the past few years, and significant enforcement activity has been the result of “relators,” who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the United States (and if applicable, particular states) under federal and state false claims laws.  Under the federal False Claims Act relators can be entitled to receive up to 30% of total recoveries.  Also, violations of the federal False Claims Act can result in treble damages, and each false claim submitted can be subject to a penalty of up to $11,000 per claim.  Most states have adopted similar state false claims laws, and these state laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal False Claims Act penalties.  The Health Care Reform Law significantly strengthened the federal False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Law provisions, which could lead to the possibility of increased whistleblower or relator suits, and among other things made clear that a federal Anti-Kickback Law violation can be a basis for federal False Claims Act liability.




The United States government (among others) has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other.  As a result, we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance.




We also are subject to certain United States and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-bribery laws, anti-corruption laws, and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records, which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years.  Our businesses are generally subject to numerous other laws and regulations that could impact our financial results, including, without limitation, securities, antitrust and marketing laws and regulations.  Failure to comply with laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.




Failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations and other laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs, and could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Also, these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses.  Even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs.  In addition, many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts, and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities, increasing the risk of non-compliance.  We may determine to enter into settlements, make payments, agree to consent decrees or enter into other arrangements to resolve such matters.  For example, one of our subsidiaries recently resolved an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) related to the manner in which it advertised certain data security features of its dental practice management software, which resulted in a consent order and fine.  Failure to comply with consent decrees could materially adversely affect our business.

While we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse and other laws and regulations, and believe we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance, we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business.




If we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to the confidentiality of sensitive personal information or standards in electronic health data transmissions, we could be required to make significant changes to our products, or incur substantial fines, penalties or other liabilities.




Our businesses that involve physician and dental practice management products include electronic information technology systems that store and process personal health, clinical, financial and other sensitive information of individuals.  These information technology systems may be vulnerable to breakdown, wrongful intrusions, data breaches and malicious attack, which could require us to expend significant resources to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns, and could involve claims against us by private parties and/or governmental agencies.  For example, we are directly or indirectly subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information, such as HIPAA.  HIPAA requires, among other things, the implementation of various recordkeeping, operational, notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information, limit its use to allowed purposes and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches.  Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to breach of contract claims, substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation.  Also, evolving laws and regulations in this area could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain, use or disseminate patient information, or could require us to incur significant additional costs to re-design our products in a timely manner to reflect these legal requirements, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.




Other health information standards, such as regulations under HIPAA, establish standards regarding electronic health data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specified electronic transactions, for example transactions involving claims submissions to third party payers.  Commencing July 1, 2012, CMS required that electronic claim submissions and related electronic transactions be conducted under a new HIPAA transaction standard called Version 5010.  CMS has required this upgrade in connection with another new requirement applicable to the industry, the implementation of new diagnostic code sets to be used in claims submission, called the ICD-10-CM.  The ICD-10-CM standard was implemented on October 1, 2015, and claims with dates of service of October 1, 2015 or after must be submitted using ICD-10-CM code sets.  Certain of our businesses provide electronic practice management products that must meet these requirements, and while we believe that our products have timely adopted the new standards, it is possible that the transition to these new standards, particularly the transition to ICD-10-CM, may result in a degree of disruption and confusion, thus potentially increasing the costs associated with supporting these products.  Failure to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive personal information in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements, or to abide by electronic health data transmission standards, could expose us to breach of contract claims, substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation.




In addition, federal initiatives provide a program of incentive payments available to certain health care providers involving the adoption and use of certain electronic health care records systems and processes.  The initiatives include providing, among others, physicians and dentists, with financial incentives if they meaningfully use certified EHR systems in accordance with applicable requirements.  In addition, Medicare-eligible providers that fail to timely adopt certified EHR systems and meet “meaningful use” requirements for those systems in accordance with regulatory requirements are to be subject to cumulative Medicare reimbursement reductions, which reductions for applicable health professionals (including physicians and dentists) began on January 1, 2015.  Qualification for the incentive payments requires the use of EHRs that have certain capabilities for meaningful use pursuant to evolving standards adopted by CMS and ONC.  Generally, initial (“Stage 1”) standards addressed criteria for periods beginning in 2011, and more demanding “Stage 2” standards addressed criteria for periods beginning in 2014.  On October 6, 2015, CMS and ONC released comprehensive final rules with respect to the EHR program that, among other things, establish the more challenging “Stage 3” criteria, making certain adjustments to Stage 1 and Stage 2 standards (e.g., reducing the 2015 reporting period from a full year to 90 days), and finalize 2015 edition health technology (HIT) certification criteria (which is now added to the existing 2014 edition HIT certification criteria, but not required until 2018).  Notably, under the new rules, compliance with

Stage 3 standards will be optional for providers in 2017, and would generally be required for all eligible providers (regardless of prior participation in the EHR incentive program) for 2018 reporting periods and subsequently. Developers and others involved in the manufacture of EHR program technology will have this interim period to develop and certify products, and work with customers to implement products for the 2018 EHR program period. In connection with the release of the October 6 rules, HHS has also stated it will continue to modify applicable EHR program standards. In addition, under the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA), which establishes the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS), over the next few years the EHR program is expected to become part of a more comprehensive federal quality measurement and incentive program, apparently with modified applicable requirements, and CMS has indicated that it may even supplant certain Stage 3 rules with more streamlined MIPS approaches. Certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified EHR systems and other products linked to incentive programs, and therefore we must maintain compliance with, and are affected by, these changing governmental criteria.

 

Our global operations are subject to inherent risks that could materially adversely affect our business.




Global operations are subject to risks that may materially adversely affect our business.  The risks that our global operations are subject to include, among other things:








•

  

difficulties and costs relating to staffing and managing foreign operations;











•

  

difficulties in establishing channels of distribution;











•

  

fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies;











•

  

longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions;











•

  

repatriation of cash from our foreign operations to the United States;











•

  

regulatory requirements;











•

  

anti-bribery, anti-corruption and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records;











•

  

unexpected difficulties in importing or exporting our products;











•

  

imposition of import/export duties, quotas, sanctions or penalties;











•

  

difficulties and delays inherent in sourcing products and contract manufacturing in foreign markets;











•

  

limitations on our ability under local laws to protect our intellectual property;











•

  

unexpected regulatory, legal, economic and political changes in foreign markets;











•

  

changes in tax regulations that influence purchases of capital equipment;











•

  

civil disturbances, geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism, war or political or military coups; and











•

  

public health emergencies.







Our expansion through acquisitions and joint ventures involves risks.




We have expanded our domestic and international markets in part through acquisitions and joint ventures, and we expect to continue to make acquisitions and enter into joint ventures in the future.  Such transactions involve numerous risks, including possible material adverse effects on our financial results or the market price of our common stock.  Some of our acquisitions and future acquisitions may also give rise to an obligation by us to make contingent payments or to satisfy certain repurchase obligations, which payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.  In addition, integrating acquired businesses and joint ventures:








•

  

may result in a loss of customers or product lines of the acquired businesses or joint ventures;











•

  

requires significant management attention;







  



26







Table of Contents



 





•

  

may place significant demands on our operations, information systems and financial resources; and











•

  

results in additional acquisition and integration expenses.







There can be no assurance that our future acquisitions or joint ventures will be successful.  Our ability to continue to successfully effect acquisitions and joint ventures will depend upon the following:








•

  

the availability of suitable acquisition or joint venture candidates at acceptable prices;











•

  

our ability to consummate such transactions, which could potentially be prohibited due to U.S. or foreign antitrust regulations;











•

  

the availability of financing on acceptable terms, in the case of non-stock transactions;











•

  

the liquidity of our investments and our ability to raise capital could be affected by the financial credit markets; and











•

  

our ability to retain, recruit, and incentivize the management of the companies we acquire.







Our acquisitions may not result in the benefits and revenue growth we expect.




We are in the process of integrating companies that we acquired and including the operations, services, products and personnel of each company within our management policies, procedures and strategies.  We cannot be sure that we will achieve the benefits of revenue growth that we expect from these acquisitions or that we will not incur unforeseen additional costs or expenses in connection with these acquisitions.  To effectively manage our expected future growth, we must continue to successfully manage our integration of these companies and continue to improve our operational systems, internal procedures, working capital management, and financial and operational controls.  If we fail in any of these areas, our business could be materially adversely affected.




We face inherent risk of exposure to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury.




Our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business, and from time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of products.  Additionally, we own interests in companies that manufacture certain dental products.  As a result, we are subject to the potential risk of product liability or other claims relating to the manufacture and distribution of products by those entities.  Additionally, as our private-label business continues to grow, purchasers of such products may increasingly seek recourse directly from us, rather than the ultimate product manufacturer, for product-related claims.  Another potential risk we face in the distribution of our products is liability resulting from counterfeit or tainted products infiltrating the supply chain.  In addition, some of the products that we transport and sell are considered hazardous materials.  The improper handling of such materials or accidents involving the transportation of such materials could subject us to liability.  We have various insurance policies, including product liability insurance, covering risks and in amounts that we consider adequate.  In many cases in which we have been sued in connection with products manufactured by others, the manufacturer of the product provides us with indemnification.  There can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost, or that indemnification agreements will provide us with adequate protection.  A successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance or not covered by indemnification agreements, or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us, could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation.




Our technology segment depends upon continued software and e-services product development, technical support and successful marketing.




Competition among companies supplying practice management software and/or e-services is intense and increasing.  Our future sales of practice management software and e-services will depend on, among other factors:








•

  

the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs;











•

  

our ability to enhance our products and services to satisfy customer requirements; and




 



  



27







Table of Contents



 





•

  

our ability to provide ongoing technical support.







We cannot be sure that we will be successful in introducing and marketing new software, software enhancements or e-services, or that such software, software enhancements and e-services will be released on time or accepted by the market.  Our software and applicable e-services products, like software products generally, may contain undetected errors or bugs when introduced or as new versions are released.  We cannot be sure that future problems with post-release software errors or bugs will not occur.  Any such defective software may result in increased expenses related to the software and could adversely affect our relationships with the customers using such software as well as our reputation.  We do not have any patents on our software or e-services, and rely upon copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as contractual and common law protections.  We cannot provide assurance that such legal protections will be available or enforceable to protect our software or e-services products.




We may experience competition from third-party online commerce sites.




Traditional health care supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions.  The continued advancement of online commerce by third parties will require us to cost-effectively adapt to changing technologies, to enhance existing services and to differentiate our business (including with additional value-added services) to address changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis.  The emergence of such potential competition and our inability to anticipate and effectively respond to changes on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business.




Security risks generally associated with our information systems and our technology products and services could materially adversely affect our business, and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected if our information systems (or third-party systems we rely on) are interrupted, damaged by unforeseen events, cyberattacks or fail for any extended period of time.




We rely on information systems (IS) in our business to obtain, rapidly process, analyze, manage and store data to, among other things:








•

  

maintain and manage worldwide systems to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers;











•

  

receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis;











•

  

manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers;











•

  

process payments to suppliers; and











•

  

provide products and services that maintain certain of our customers’ electronic medical or dental records (including protected health information of their patients).







Information security risks have generally increased in recent years, and a cyberattack that bypasses our IS security systems causing an IS security breach may lead to a material disruption of our IS business systems and/or the loss of business information resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.




In addition, we develop products and provide services to our customers that are technology-based, and a cyberattack that bypasses the IS security systems of our products or services causing a security breach and/or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products or services could also cause significant reputational harm, and actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies.   In particular, certain of our practice management products and services purchased by health care providers, such as physicians and dentists, are used to store and manage patient medical or dental records.  These customers are subject to laws and regulations, such as HIPAA, which require that they protect the privacy and security of those records, and our products may be used as part of these customers’ comprehensive data security programs, including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws.  Perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services, or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products to comply with applicable legal requirements, may not only cause us significant reputational harm, but may also lead to claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies and involve fines and penalties, costs for remediation, and substantial defense and settlement expenses.

Regarding direct customer claims, although our customer license agreements typically contain provisions that seek to eliminate or limit our exposure to such liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges, or that we will be able to obtain such provisions in all cases.




In addition, our information systems also utilize certain third party service organizations that manage a portion of our information systems, and our business may be materially adversely affected if these third party service organizations are subject to an IS security breach.  Additionally, legislative or regulatory action related to cybersecurity may increase our costs to develop or implement new technology products and services.




Risks associated with these and other IS security breaches may include, among other things:








•

  

future results could be materially adversely affected due to the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of confidential data or intellectual property;











•

  

operational or business delays resulting from the disruption of information systems and subsequent clean-up and mitigation activities;











•

  

procedures and safeguards must continually evolve to meet new IS challenges, and enhancing protections, and conducting investigations and remediation, may impose additional costs on us;











•

  

we may incur claims, fines and penalties, and costs for remediation, or substantial defense and settlement expenses; and











•

  

negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with our customers, partners or industry peers.




 


We also deliver Internet-based services and, accordingly, depend on our ability and the ability of our customers to access the Internet.  In the event of any difficulties, outages and delays by Internet service providers, we may be impeded from providing such services, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation.




We have various insurance policies, including cyber liability insurance, covering risks and in amounts that we consider adequate.  There can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost.  Successful claims for misappropriation or release of confidential or personal data brought against us in excess of available insurance or fines or other penalties assessed or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us, could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation.


Certain provisions in our governing documents and other documents to which we are a party may discourage third-party offers to acquire us that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares.




The provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, may discourage acquisition bids and may limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.  These provisions, among other things:








•

  

require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 60% of the shares of common stock entitled to vote to approve a merger, consolidation, or a sale, lease, transfer or exchange of all or substantially all of our assets; and











•

  

require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of our common stock entitled to vote to (i) remove a director; and (ii) to amend or repeal our by-laws, with certain limited exceptions.







In addition, our 2013 Stock Incentive Plan and 2015 Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive Plan provide for accelerated vesting of stock options upon a change in control.  These incentive plans also authorize the committee under the plans to provide for accelerated vesting of other types of equity awards in connection with a change in control at grant or thereafter, and certain other awards made under these incentive plans (such as restricted stock/unit awards) accelerate upon a change in control or upon certain termination events in connection with a change in control.  Further, certain agreements between us and our executive officers provide for increased severance payments and certain benefits if those executive officers are terminated without cause by us or if they terminate for good reason in each case, within two years after a change in control or within ninety days prior to the effective date of the change in control or after the first public announcement of the pendency of the change in control.

Tax legislation could materially adversely affect our financial results and tax liabilities.




We are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and local governments, as well as foreign jurisdictions.  From time to time, various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could materially adversely affect our tax positions. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate will not be materially adversely affected by legislation resulting from these initiatives.  In addition, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations.  Although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge.
