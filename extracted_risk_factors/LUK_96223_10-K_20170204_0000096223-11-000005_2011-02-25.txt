Financial Information about Segments




The Company’s reportable segments consist of the consolidated operating units identified above, which offer different products and services and are managed separately.  Prior to its consolidation in November 2009, the Company’s investment in Keen was classified as an investment in an associated company.  Other operations primarily consist of the Company’s wineries and energy projects.




Associated companies include equity interests in other entities that the Company accounts for under the equity method of accounting.  Investments in associated companies that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting include HomeFed Corporation (“HomeFed”), a corporation engaged in real estate activities, JHYH, Berkadia and Garcadia, a joint venture that owns automobile dealerships.  In the past the Company has made non-controlling investments in investment partnerships that are engaged in investing and/or securities transactions activities which were accounted for under the equity method of accounting; however, remaining investments of this kind are not material.  Associated companies also include the Company’s investment in Jefferies and in ACF prior to its sale in 2010
, which were accounted for at fair value rather than under the equity method of accounting.




Corporate assets primarily consist of investments and cash and cash equivalents and corporate revenues primarily consist of investment and other income and securities gains and losses.  Corporate assets include the Company’s investment in Fortescue and in the Inmet common shares.  Corporate assets, revenues, overhead expenses and interest expense are not allocated to the operating units.




Conwed Plastics has manufacturing facilities located in Belgium and Mexico; these are the only foreign operations with non-U.S. revenue or assets that the Company consolidates, and are not material.  Unconsolidated non-U.S. based investments include a small Caribbean-based telecommunications provider and the investments in Fortescue and Inmet.  From time to time the Company may invest in the securities of non-U.S. entities or in investment partnerships that invest in non-U.S. securities.




Certain information concerning the Company’s segments is presented in the following table.  Consolidated subsidiaries are reflected as of the date a majority controlling interest was acquired, which was November 2009 for Keen.  Associated Companies are not considered to be a reportable segment, but are reflected in the table below under income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and identifiable assets employed.

Manufacturing

 

Idaho Timber

 

Business Description

 

Idaho Timber, which was acquired in May 2005, is headquartered in Boise, Idaho and is engaged in the manufacture and/or distribution of various wood products.  Idaho Timber’s principal product lines include remanufacturing dimension lumber; remanufacturing, bundling and bar coding of home center boards for large retailers; and production of 5/4” radius-edge, pine decking.  Idaho Timber also manufactures and/or distributes a number of other specialty wood products.  Idaho Timber has over 30 years of operating experience in its industry.  The net book value of the Company’s investment in Idaho Timber was $75,200,000 at December 31, 2010.




  



7







  







Remanufactured dimension lumber is Idaho Timber’s largest product line.  Dimension lumber is used for general construction and home improvement, remodeling and repair projects, the demand for which is normally a function of housing starts and home size.  All dimension lumber is assigned a quality grade, based on the imperfections in the wood, and higher-grade lumber is sold at a higher price than lower-grade lumber.  Idaho Timber purchases low-grade dimension lumber from sawmills located in North America and Europe and upgrades it into higher-grade dimension lumber products.  The remanufacturing process includes ripping, trimming and planing lumber to reduce imperfections and produce a variety of lumber sizes.  These products are produced at plants located in Florida, North Carol
ina, Texas, Idaho and New Mexico.  Each plant distributes its product primarily by truck to lumber yards and contractors within a 300 mile shipping radius from the plant site.




Home center board products are principally sold to large home improvement retailers.  Idaho Timber purchases high-grade boards from sawmills in the western U.S., South America and New Zealand (primarily pine but other wood species are also used), performs minor re-work on those boards to upgrade the quality, and then packages and bar codes those boards according to customer specifications.  Production takes place in an owned plant in Idaho.  Idaho Timber also operates a sawmill in Arkansas to produce its 5/4” radius-edge, pine decking products.  Idaho Timber performs traditional sawmill processes (cutting, drying and planing) to manufacture these products.




Idaho Timber owns and operates seven plants, one sawmill that principally produces decking products and one sawmill that produces split-rail fencing.  These nine facilities in the aggregate have approximately 748,000 square feet of manufacturing and office space, covering approximately 154 acres.  One plant is principally dedicated to home center board products and the remaining plants principally produce remanufactured dimension lumber products.  All plant locations can produce and distribute specialty wood products.  Idaho Timber has the capacity to ship approximately 62 million board feet per month on a one shift basis; during 2010 actual shipments averaged approximately 32 million board feet per month.




Sales and Marketing




Idaho Timber primarily markets to local, regional and national lumber retailers for its dimension lumber products, home improvement centers for its home center board products and decking treaters for its sawmill product, and other resellers of home construction materials.  Its success in attracting and retaining customers depends in large part on its ability to provide quicker delivery of specified customer products than its competitors.  For dimension lumber products, sales are primarily generated at each of the plants, with a dedicated sales force located in the same geographic region as the customers the plant serves.  Board and decking products are sold and managed centrally.  Sales of home center board products are heavily dependent on national home center chains which accounted for appro
ximately 78% of product revenues and 16% of Idaho Timber’s total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010.




The customer base for the dimension lumber business is much less concentrated; no customer accounts for more than 10% of revenue.  Idaho Timber’s sales are somewhat concentrated in regions where its facilities are located, with the largest being Florida, 17%; North Carolina, 15%; and Texas, 12%.




Competition




Idaho Timber sells commodity products, and operates in an industry that is very competitive and currently suffering from continuing lack of demand due to limited housing starts and remodeling activity.  Idaho Timber competes against domestic and foreign sawmills and intermediate distributors for its dimension lumber and decking products.  In some cases, Idaho Timber competes on a limited basis with the same sawmills that are a source of supply of low-grade dimension lumber.  The home center board business has many competitors, and suppliers to large home centers are always under pressure to reduce prices.




  



8







  




Idaho Timber also competes for raw material purchases needed for its remanufactured dimension lumber and home center board products. A recent increase in off-shore demand for low-grade lumber used in its remanufacturing facilities has further constrained available supply.  Also, in the past the availability and pricing of certain raw materials has been adversely affected by export charges (tariffs) imposed on Canadian exports, the largest source of these supplies.  A decades old trade dispute between the U.S. and Canada resurfaced with the expiration of the Softwood Lumber Agreement in 2001.  In October 2006, the trade dispute was resolved and a new Softwood Lumber Agreement between Canada and the U.S. became effective.  The agreement has a seven year term and may be extended for an additional t
wo years.  Currently, restrictions on Canadian exports are not significantly adversely affecting Idaho Timber’s operations; however, if tariffs continue beyond the current term of the Softwood Lumber Agreement or further import limitations are imposed in the future, it is possible that raw material costs could increase or supplies could be constrained.  During most of 2010, the export charge was at the maximum level.  Idaho Timber is examining alternative sources of supply to increase its raw material purchasing flexibility.




Government Regulation




Lumber and decking are identified at Idaho Timber facilities with a grade stamp that shows the grade, moisture content, mill number, species and grading agency.  All lumber is graded in compliance with the National Grading Rule for Dimension Lumber, which is published by the U.S. Department of Commerce.  Idaho Timber facilities are subject to regular inspection by agencies approved by the American Lumber Standards Committee.  Idaho Timber believes that its procedure for grading lumber is highly accurate; however, Idaho Timber could be exposed to product liability claims if it can be demonstrated its products are inappropriately rated.




Since Idaho Timber’s sawmills do not treat its wood with chemicals, and since timber deeds purchased from private land owners do not impose a re-planting obligation, Idaho Timber does not have any unusual environmental compliance issues.




Plastics Manufacturing




Business Description




Through Conwed Plastics, which was acquired in March 1985, the Company manufactures and markets lightweight plastic netting used for a variety of purposes including, among other things, building and construction, erosion control, packaging, agricultural, carpet padding, filtration and consumer products.  These products are primarily used for containment purposes, reinforcement of other products, packaging for produce and meats, various types of filtration and erosion prevention.  Conwed Plastics believes it is a market leader in netting products used in carpet cushion, turf reinforcement, erosion control and packaging.  Agricultural, erosion control and building and construction markets tend to be seasonal, with peak periods in the second and third quarters of the calendar year.  Packaging is se
asonal with the second quarter being the slowest period in this market.  Carpet padding, filtration and consumer product markets are not usually subject to seasonal fluctuations resulting in sales that tend to be evenly spread throughout the year.   The net book value of the Company’s investment in Conwed Plastics was $51,100,000 at December 31, 2010.




Certain products of Conwed Plastics are proprietary, protected by patents and/or trade secrets.  The Company holds patents on certain improvements to the basic manufacturing processes it uses and on applications thereof.  The Company believes that the expiration of these patents, individually or in the aggregate, is unlikely to have a material effect on its operations.




Sales and Marketing




Products are marketed both domestically and internationally, with approximately 23% of 2010 revenues generated by customers from Europe, Latin America, Japan and Australia.  Products are sold primarily through an employee sales force, located in the U.S. and Europe.  Conwed Plastics emphasizes development of new products and new applications of existing products to grow its revenues.  New product development focuses on market niches where proprietary technology and expertise can lead to sustainable competitive economic advantages.  Conwed Plastics has completed eight acquisitions since 2004 and continues to look for additional acquisition opportunities.  These acquisitions have provided synergies with existing customers, manufacturing capacity, an expanded customer base and/or product 
lines.




  



9







  







Approximately half of Conwed Plastics’ revenues are generated on a make to order basis.  The remainder of Conwed Plastics’ sales requires a more substantial investment in inventory that is stored at various locations to service customers with short lead time requirements.  In the aggregate, inventory is turned over between 6 and 10 times per year.  The top 10 customers typically represent approximately 30%  to 40% of total sales.  The largest single customer typically represents 5% to 8% of total sales; for the year ended December 31, 2010, the largest single customer represented approximately 8% of total sales.  Order backlog generally ranges from 6% to 12% of annual sales throughout the year.




Competition




Conwed Plastics is subject to domestic and international competition, generally on the basis of price, service and quality.  Conwed Plastics has 3 to 5 competitors in most of its market segments but the size and type of its competition varies by market segment.  Additionally, certain products are dependent on cyclical industries, including the construction industry.  The cost of the principal raw material used in its products, polypropylene, has increased by approximately 146% from 2002.  The price of polypropylene has historically fluctuated with the price of oil and natural gas but growing economies in China and India have resulted in increased demand for raw materials and raised prices globally.  Conwed Plastics has been able to raise prices to its customers during this period to of
fset some of the increase in raw material costs; however, increasing competitive pressures have reduced Conwed’s ability to further raise prices to offset rising raw material costs.

 
 

Oil and Gas Drilling Services




Acquisition




The Company initially acquired a 30% limited liability company interest in and provided secured financing to Keen in 2006; thereafter, the Company increased its equity interest and loans at various times during 2007 and 2008.  In November 2009, the Company purchased Keen’s remaining equity interests plus a secured note payable to the other equity owner of Keen for aggregate cash consideration of $15,000,000.  At December 31, 2010, the Company owns all of Keen’s equity interests and the net book value of its investment in Keen’s debt and equity securities aggregated $216,700,000.




Business Description




Keen is a land based contract oil and gas drilling company based in Stillwater, Oklahoma that provides drilling services to independent oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in the Mid-Continent Region of the U.S.  Keen currently operates drilling rigs in Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana and Kansas.  Keen, which has been in business since 1991, typically generates revenues through drilling contracts based on daily rates (daywork contracts), footage (charged by depth of the well) or based on a turnkey contract (fixed price to drill a well).  Keen supplies the drilling rig, all ancillary equipment and drilling personnel.  The majority of wells drilled by Keen are in unconventional basins that are characterized by complex geological formations often requiring higher horsepowe
r, premium rigs and/or experienced crews to reach targeted depths.  In 2010, the majority of drilling services were performed pursuant to daywork contracts.




Each of Keen’s drilling rigs consists of engines, drawworks, a mast, pumps, blowout preventers, a drill string and ancillary equipment.  Keen’s drilling rigs can operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week and are generally staffed with crews of four to six persons.  Once Keen has drilled a well for a customer, the drilling rig will be moved off of the well and another service provider will use a service rig (a smaller rig) that is built for completions, which brings the well into production.  Keen does not provide completion services.   The intended well depth and the geological formation of the drilling site are the principal factors that determine the size and type of rig most suitable for a particular drilling job.  All of Keen’s rigs are capable of drilling ho
rizontal and directional wells.




  



10







  







At December 31, 2010, Keen has 38 drilling rigs in its fleet that have rated maximum depth capabilities ranging from 6,500 feet to 22,000 feet.  Keen’s employees perform periodic maintenance and routine repair work on the drilling rigs; the bulk of major repair and overhaul work is done by various oilfield service companies.  Keen also owns and operates a fleet of trucks, trailers and other construction equipment used to transport its rigs and to construct or take down its rigs at drilling locations.  By owning its own equipment, Keen believes it is able to better manage the cost of moving its rigs, reduce the downtime between moves and minimize the general wear and tear on drilling rigs.  Keen’s customers are not required to use Keen’s equipment or trucks to move Keen’s 
drilling rigs.

 
 

Keen’s revenue volume and profitability are significantly affected by the actual and anticipated price of natural gas and oil, levels of natural gas and oil in storage and the supply of drilling rigs available in the marketplace.  The exploration and production industry is cyclical and the level of exploration and production activity has historically been very volatile.  During periods of lower levels of drilling activity, price competition for drilling services tends to increase, which may result in reduced revenues and profitability; conversely, during periods of increased drilling activity, drilling rigs are in demand often resulting in higher prices and contractual commitments from customers to obtain exclusive use of a particular rig for a longer term.  While Keen’s revenues and profitabi
lity during 2010 were adversely impacted by continued low natural gas prices and high levels of natural gas inventory, this was partially offset by increased drilling activity for oil.  Seasonality does not significantly impact Keen’s business or operations.




Additionally, the drilling activity of oil and natural gas exploration and production companies is strongly affected by their ability to access the capital markets, which was curtailed during late 2008 and 2009.  Many of Keen’s customers reduced their spending plans for exploration, production and development activities resulting in decreased demand for Keen’s rigs.  Keen’s customers’ access to the capital markets improved during 2010, though available liquidity is not as great as it was before 2008.  Decreases in drilling activity and spending for a sustained period of time is likely to result in a reduction in Keen’s daily rates, utilization rates and profitability.




Sales and Marketing




Keen markets its drilling rigs to a number of independent oil and gas companies.  Most of Keen’s contracts are with established customers on a competitive bid or negotiated basis and may cover one well, a multi-well project or are entered into for a specified period of time.  At December 31, 2010, Keen has 2 drilling rigs under contract for a remaining term of more than 1 year, 18 rigs are operating under term contracts that will expire within the next 12 months, 3 are under well-to-well contracts with specific customers, and 15 are not currently under contract.  In January 2011, Keen sold its 12 older mechanical rigs; only three of these rigs were operating under contract at the end of the year.  During 2010, these 12 rigs generated revenues of $20,700,000.




Keen’s business is fairly concentrated with its top eight customers accounting for over 77% of 2010 drilling revenues.  Two customers accounted for 34% of 2010 drilling revenues and six other customers each exceeded 5% of 2010 drilling revenues.  In 2009, Keen’s revenues are only reflected in the consolidated financial statements from when it became a consolidated subsidiary in November 2009.




Competition




Customers award contracts to contract drillers based on factors such as price, rig availability, quality of service, proximity to the well site, experience with the specific geological formation, condition and type of equipment, reputation, safety of operations and customer relationships.  Contracts for drilling services may be awarded based solely on price.  There is currently an oversupply of drilling rigs in the market, and at such times price is the primary determinant by which customers award contracts.  Although contract drilling companies generally compete on a regional basis, drilling rigs can be moved from one market to another in response to market conditions which can have the effect of increasing competition.

Gaming Entertainment

 

Acquisition




Acquired in 2006, the Company owns approximately 61% of Premier’s common units and all of Premier’s preferred units, which accrue an annual preferred return of 17%.  The Company also acquired Premier’s junior subordinated note and has provided other financing to Premier.  At December 31, 2010, the net book value of the Company’s aggregate investment in Premier was $237,700,000.




Business Description




Premier owns the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Biloxi, located in Biloxi, Mississippi, which opened to the public on June 30, 2007.  The Hard Rock Biloxi was scheduled to open to the public on August 31, 2005; however, two days prior to opening, Hurricane Katrina hit the Mississippi Gulf Coast and severely damaged the hotel and related structures and completely destroyed the casino.  The hotel was repaired and the casino rebuilt principally with funds received from Premier’s insurance carriers.




The Hard Rock Hotel & Casino is located on an 8.5 acre site on the Mississippi Gulf Coast and has approximately 1,268 slot machines, 52 table games, six live poker tables, five restaurants (including a Hard Rock Café and Ruth’s Chris Steakhouse), a full service spa, a 5,200 square foot pool area, 3,000 square feet of retail space, an eleven-story hotel with 325 rooms and suites and a Hard Rock Live! entertainment venue with a capacity of 1,500 persons.




Premier’s marketing strategy is to position the resort as a full service gaming, boutique hotel and entertainment resort catering to the Mississippi Gulf Coast marketplace and the southern region of the U.S.  The Mississippi Gulf Coast region is located along the Interstate 10 corridor and is within a ninety minute drive from the New Orleans metropolitan area, Mobile, Alabama and the Florida panhandle.  Premier’s primary means of marketing utilizes its database of customers for direct mail campaigns and promotional giveaways designed to reward customers and generate loyalty and repeat visits.  In addition, Premier benefits from the “Hard Rock” brand name which appeals to a broad range of customers and from its superior location, which is within walking distance of the Beau Rivage, 
an MGM Mirage property and the largest hotel and casino in the Mississippi Gulf Coast market.




 The Hard Rock Biloxi’s new casino was constructed over water on concrete pilings that greatly improved the structural integrity of the facility; however, the threat of hurricanes remains a risk to the repaired and rebuilt facilities.  Premier’s current insurance policy provides up to $232,000,000 in coverage for damage to real and personal property including business interruption coverage.  The coverage is provided by a panel of insurers based out of the U.S., Bermuda, and London and is comprised of a $50,000,000 primary layer and three excess layers. The coverage is syndicated through several insurance carriers, each with an A.M. Best Rating of A- (Excellent) or better.  Although the insurance policy is an all risk policy, any loss resulting from a weather catastrophe occurrence, which 
is defined to include damage caused by a named storm, is sublimited to $100,000,000 with a deductible of $5,000,000.




Chapter 11 Litigation

 

  In connection with Premier’s chapter 11 restructuring, the former holders of Premier’s bond debt argued that they were entitled to liquidated damages under the indenture governing the notes, and as such were entitled to more than the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest that was paid to them when Premier emerged from bankruptcy in 2007.  Although the Company did not agree with the position taken by the Premier noteholders, in order to have Premier’s bankruptcy plan confirmed so that Premier could complete reconstruction of its property after Hurricane Katrina and open its business without further delay, Premier funded an escrow account to cover the Premier noteholders’ claim for additional damages in the amount of $13,700,000.  On September 3, 2010, the Bankruptcy Court
 for the Southern District of Mississippi awarded the Premier noteholders $9,600,000, plus interest at the federal judgment rate in effect on August 10, 2007 from that date until the date of payment, but in no event would the Premier noteholders be entitled to damages in an amount exceeding the amount held in the escrow account.  Any funds remaining in the escrow account after payment of the award are to be returned to Premier.  Premier has filed a notice of appeal of the Bankruptcy Court’s decision; no amounts are expected to be paid from the escrow account while the appeal is pending.  As a result of the Bankruptcy Court’s decision, the Company recorded a loss in selling, general and other expenses in 2010 for the award and interest of $11,200,000.

Competition




Premier faces significant competition primarily from ten other gaming operations in the Mississippi Gulf Coast gaming market and secondarily from gaming operations in Baton Rouge and New Orleans, Louisiana as well as from a Native American casino in Atmore, Alabama.  Other competition comes from gaming operations in Lake Charles, Bossier City and Shreveport, Louisiana; Tunica and Philadelphia, Mississippi; Tampa and Hollywood, Florida and other states.  Such competition may increase if gaming operations grow in these markets or if legalized gaming expands to nearby states.  Many of Premier’s competitors are larger and have greater marketing and financial resources.




Government Regulation

 

The gaming industry in Mississippi is highly regulated.  Premier, its ownership and management are subject to findings of suitability reviews by the Mississippi Gaming Commission.  In addition, the laws, rules and regulations of state and local governments in Mississippi require Premier to hold various licenses, registrations and permits and to obtain various approvals for a variety of matters.  In order to continue operating, Premier must remain in compliance with all laws, rules and regulations and pay gaming taxes on its gross gaming revenues.  Failure to maintain such approvals or obtain renewals when due, or failure to comply with new laws or regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations would have an adverse effect on Premier’s business.  Premier believes it is in compliance with all governmenta
l rules and regulations.




Domestic Real Estate




At December 31, 2010, the Company’s net investment in the domestic real estate segment was $141,200,000.  The real estate operations include a mixture of commercial properties, residential land development projects and other unimproved land, all in various stages of development.  Certain of the Company’s real estate investments and the real estate carrying values as of December 31, 2010 include: a large scale mixed-use development project with various residential, retail and commercial space located in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina ($33,600,000); approximately 66 acres of land used by Garcadia, the automobile dealership joint venture ($52,000,000);  approximately 76 acres of land located on the island of Islesboro, Maine (approved for 13 residential waterfront lots) and 45 fully developed resid
ential lots on approximately 120 acres of land located in Rockport, Maine on Penobscot Bay, ($45,800,000 in the aggregate); and a 15 acre, unentitled air rights parcel above the train tracks behind Union Station in Washington, D.C. ($11,400,000).  Except for the Myrtle Beach project, none of these projects are secured by any indebtedness.




One of the Company’s real estate subsidiaries (“MB1”) has been the owner and developer of a 12 acre mixed use real estate project located in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.  The project is comprised of a retail center with approximately 346,000 square feet of retail space, 41,000 square feet of office space and 195 residential apartment rental units (real estate carrying value of $18,100,000).  The acquisition and construction costs were funded by capital contributed by the Company and nonrecourse indebtedness with a balance of $100,500,000 at December 31, 2010, that is collateralized by the real estate.  The Company also owns 46 acres of land adjacent to the Myrtle Beach project which is planned for 1,151 residential units, including a mixture of single family homes, townhouses and cond
ominium units, and a 15 acre parcel that is planned for 181,000 square feet of retail space (aggregate book value of $15,500,000).  The land and the residential units are not collateral for MB1’s indebtedness.




During the second quarter of 2009, MB1 was unable to make scheduled payments under its interest rate swap agreement and received several default notices under its bank loan.  These events constituted a change in circumstances that caused the Company to conclude that the carrying amount of MB1’s real estate asset was not recoverable; accordingly, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $67,800,000 (classified as selling, general and other expenses), which reduced the carrying amount of MB1’s real estate to its fair value.  Although MB1’s bank loan matured in October 2009, it was not repaid since MB1 did not have sufficient funds and the Company was under no obligation to provide the funds to MB1 to pay off the loan.




  



13







  







During the second quarter of 2010, MB1 entered into an agreement with its lenders under which, among other things, MB1 agreed not to interfere with or oppose foreclosure proceedings and the lenders agreed to release MB1 and various guarantors of the loan.  A receiver was put in place at the property, foreclosure proceedings commenced and an auction of the property was conducted; however, the Company was informed during the fourth quarter of 2010 that the highest bidder for the property failed to close.  In December 2010, the Company was invited to make a bid for the property, with the condition that a foreclosure sale to the Company must close as soon as possible without any due diligence period, which new bidders for the property would require.  A subsidiary of the Company offered $19,300,000 for the p
roperty (including net working capital amounts); the offer was accepted and the foreclosure sale closed on January 7, 2011.




As a result of the failure of the initial buyer to purchase the property and the subsequent sale to the Company in 2011, the Company concluded that the carrying value of the property was further impaired at December 31, 2010; accordingly, the Company recorded an additional impairment charge in 2010 of $47,100,000 to reflect the property at its fair value of $18,100,000.  At closing in 2011, MB1 was released from any remaining liability under the bank loan; accordingly, the remaining balance due after payment of the purchase price ($81,200,000) will be recognized in other income in the first quarter of 2011.  Including the cash paid in the foreclosure sale, the Company’s cumulative net cash investment in this project is $87,700,000.




In August 2010, the Company sold its operating retail shopping center in Long Island, New York for cash consideration of $17,100,000 and recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of discontinued operations of $4,500,000.  The Company has not classified this business’ historical results of operations or its assets and liabilities as discontinued operations because such amounts were not significant.




In October 2007, the Company entered into an agreement with the Panama City-Bay County Airport and Industrial District of Panama City, Florida to purchase approximately 708 acres of land which used to be the Panama City-Bay County International Airport.  The Company has placed $56,500,000 into escrow; the transaction will close only after the old airport is decommissioned by the Federal Aviation Administration and the seller can deliver free and clear title to the land, subject to contractually permitted exceptions.  Prior to closing, all interest earned on the escrow account is for the benefit of the Company and may be withdrawn at any time.  The Company has the right to terminate the agreement and receive a full refund of the escrowed funds if the closing hasn’t occurred by April 2012.  If the tra
nsaction closes, the Company intends to develop the property into a mixed use community with residential, retail, commercial, educational and office sites.   




The Company owns approximately 31.4% of the outstanding common stock of HomeFed.  In addition, as a result of a 1998 distribution to all of the Company’s shareholders, approximately 7.7% and 9.4% of HomeFed is owned by the Company’s Chairman and President, respectively.  HomeFed is currently engaged, directly and through subsidiaries, in the investment in and development of residential real estate projects in California.  At December 31, 2010, its development projects consisted of two master-planned communities located in San Diego County, California:  San Elijo Hills and a portion of the larger Otay Ranch planning area.  The Company accounts for its investment in HomeFed under the equity method of accounting.  At December 31, 2010, its investment had a carrying v
alue of $46,100,000, which is included in investments in associated companies.  HomeFed is a public company traded on the NASD OTC Bulletin Board (Symbol: HOFD).




Residential property sales volume, prices and new building starts have declined significantly in many U.S. markets, including markets in which the Company has real estate projects in various stages of development.  The slowdown in residential sales has been exacerbated by the turmoil in the mortgage lending and credit markets, which has resulted in stricter lending standards and reduced liquidity for prospective home buyers.  The Company is not actively soliciting bids for developed and undeveloped lots in Maine, and has deferred its development plans for certain other projects as well.  The Company intends to wait for market conditions to improve before marketing certain of its projects for sale.




  



14







  







The real estate development industry is subject to substantial environmental, building, construction, zoning and real estate regulations that are imposed by various federal, state and local authorities.  In order to develop its properties, the Company must obtain the approval of numerous governmental agencies regarding such matters as permitted land uses, density, the installation of utility services (such as water, sewer, gas, electric, telephone and cable television) and the dedication of acreage for various community purposes.  Furthermore, changes in prevailing local circumstances or applicable laws may require additional approvals or modifications of approvals previously obtained.  Delays in obtaining required approvals and authorizations could adversely affect the profitability of the Company’
s projects.




Medical Product Development




Business




At December 31, 2010, the Company owned approximately 93% of Sangart, a biopharmaceutical company principally engaged in developing medicines designed to enhance the oxygenation of oxygen deprived tissues through targeted oxygen delivery.  From 2003 through December 31, 2010, the Company invested an aggregate of $161,500,000 in Sangart, principally to help fund Sangart’s ongoing product development activities (as a development stage company, Sangart does not have any revenues from product sales).  Since inception, the Company has recorded Sangart losses of $151,300,000, resulting from product development expenses and Sangart’s overhead costs.  Sangart became a consolidated subsidiary in 2005; the net book value of the Company’s investment in Sangart was $8,500,000 at December 31, 2010.</
font>




In 2002, Sangart commenced human clinical trials of MP4OX, a solution of cell-free hemoglobin administered intravenously to provide rapid oxygen delivery to ischemic (oxygen deprived) tissues.  The basis for Sangart’s technology is the result of more than 20 years of research in the understanding of how hemoglobin (the oxygen carrier in red blood cells) functions outside of red blood cells in a cell-free environment and how it can be used in conjunction with normal red blood cells to enhance oxygen delivery to organ tissue.  MP4 products are made from purified human hemoglobin that is extracted from fully screened and tested outdated human blood obtained from accredited blood centers, which is then bound to polyethylene glycol molecules using Sangart’s proprietary processes.  Sangart’s m
anufacturing process is able to generate approximately four units of MP4OX using a single unit of blood.  Sangart owns or exclusively licenses sixteen U.S. patents and has more than thirty applications pending worldwide covering product composition, manufacturing or methods of use.   Patents applicable to the MP4 technology do not begin to expire until 2017.




Sangart has completed seven Phase I and Phase II human clinical studies designed to assess product safety and gather preliminary indications of the product’s effectiveness.  In 2007 and 2008, Sangart conducted two Phase III clinical trials that involved a total of 850 hip replacement surgery patients in Europe.  These studies demonstrated MP4OX’s effectiveness in preventing and treating low blood pressure during orthopedic hip replacement surgeries without significant safety concerns being identified, though in one of the Phase III studies there was a slightly higher incidence of adverse events in the MP4OX-treated patients than in the control group.  However, because these Phase III trials were conducted in a patient population having a relatively low incidence of medical complications, Sanga
rt decided not to apply for marketing approval to use MP4OX in orthopedic hip replacement surgeries following completion of those studies.




During 2010, Sangart completed a Phase II proof of concept clinical trial of MP4OX in trauma patients in Europe and South Africa.  Study results were considered to be successful and would support the conduct of a larger Phase II clinical study in trauma patients, which could commence in the first half of 2011.  If this larger Phase II study were to be successful, Sangart would have to conduct Phase III clinical studies in trauma patients.  The Phase II and Phase III trauma studies would take several years to complete at substantial cost.  Until these Phase II and Phase III studies are successfully completed, Sangart will not be able to request marketing approval and generate revenues from sales in the trauma market.




  



15







  







Sangart is also exploring the application of the MP4 technology in additional therapeutic areas.  One area of interest is sickle cell disease, for which Sangart’s MP4CO product has been granted orphan drug designation by the European Commission and U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  If Sangart is able to successfully obtain marketing approval, these designations will provide MP4CO with market exclusivity for ten years in the European Union and seven years in the United States.  Multiple human clinical trials demonstrating the safety and efficacy of MP4CO in the treatment of sickle cell disease would need to be successfully completed before marketing approval can be obtained and revenues from MP4CO sales can be generated.  Such studies would take several years to complete at substantial co
st.




Substantially all of the funding needed for MP4 development has come from sales of Sangart’s equity securities.  The Company provided Sangart with $15,300,000 of additional equity funds during 2010, and expects to provide Sangart with sufficient capital through the end of 2011, though it is under no obligation to do so.  Thereafter, significant additional funding will be needed for product development and clinical trial activities prior to regulatory approval and commercial launch; the source of such funding has not as yet been determined.




Competitive Environment




MP4 products are intended to be used as oxygen therapeutic agents in clinical and trauma situations where tissues are at risk of inadequate blood flow and oxygenation.  Currently there are no similar products approved for sale in the U.S. or the European Union; however, other companies are developing products that could potentially compete with MP4.




Any successful commercialization of MP4 products will depend on an adequate supply of raw materials, principally human red blood cells and polyethylene glycol, at an acceptable quality, quantity and price.  Sangart has contracted for a supply of human red blood cells that is expected to be sufficient to produce MP4 at volumes needed for a commercial launch; however, if the product is successful additional sources of red blood cells will be needed to support sales growth.  Commitments for quantities of polyethylene glycol to support a commercial launch have not yet been secured.




Sangart leases a 56,700 square foot combination office and manufacturing facility that currently produces MP4 products for its clinical trials.  Sangart believes that its current manufacturing facility would have adequate capacity to support a commercial launch, but significant capital improvements would be required or an alternative manufacturing site would need to be acquired for commercial production.  In addition to obtaining requisite regulatory approvals and increasing manufacturing capacity for the manufacture and sale of MP4 products, Sangart would have to create sales, marketing and distribution capabilities prior to any commercial launch of this product, either directly or in partnership with a service provider.




Government Regulation




As a product intended for medical use, clinical trials, marketing approval, manufacturing and distribution of MP4 is highly regulated.  An application for marketing approval may only be made after the safety and effectiveness of the product has been demonstrated, including through human clinical trial data.  In the U.S., the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulates medical products, including the category known as “biologics”, which includes MP4 products.  The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act govern the testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of MP4 products.




In Europe, each country has its own agency that regulates clinical trials.  However, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”), which is administered by the European Medicines Agency, is an EU-wide regulatory body.  Following completion of clinical trials, marketing approval can be granted either by a centralized application through CHMP, or on a decentralized basis by one or more selected countries.

Other Operations




Wineries




The Company’s winery operations are managed under the umbrella name, Crimson Wine Group (“Crimson”).  Crimson is engaged in the production and sale of premium, ultra premium and luxury wines (i.e., wines that retail for $10 to $14, $14 to $25 and over $25 per 750ml bottle, respectively).  Crimson is headquartered in Napa, California and owns three wineries, Pine Ridge Vineyards in Napa Valley, California, Archery Summit in the Willamette Valley of Oregon and Chamisal Vineyards in the Edna Valley of California.  Pine Ridge was acquired in 1991 and has been conducting operations since 1978, the Company started Archery Summit in 1993 and Chamisal Vineyards was acquired during 2008 and has been conducting operations since 1973.  The Company’s investment in Crimson has grown, 
principally to fund the acquisition of land for vineyard development, construct and develop Archery Summit, acquire Chamisal Vineyards, launch new brands and increase production capacity and storage facilities at the wineries.  Crimson controls approximately 188 acres of vineyards in Napa Valley, California, 119 acres of vineyards in the Willamette Valley of Oregon and 97 acres of vineyards in the Edna Valley of California, substantially all of which are owned and producing grapes.  Crimson believes that its vineyards are located in some of the most highly regarded appellations and areas of the Napa, Willamette and Edna Valleys.  Crimson sold approximately 111,000 9-liter equivalent cases of wine generating revenues of $22,700,000 during 2010 and 92,000 9-liter equivalent cases of wine generating revenues of $19,800,000 during 2009.  Additionally, in 2005 and 2006, the Company acquired an aggregate of 611 acres of land in the Horse Heaven Hills of Washington’s Co
lumbia Valley, of which approximately 85 acres have been developed into producing vineyards.  At December 31, 2010, the net book value of the Company’s aggregate investment in Crimson was $92,200,000.




Crimson is expanding its product offerings in the premium and ultra premium segments of the very competitive premium table wine market, including developing new brands at lower price points.  The combination of changing consumer spending habits in the current economic environment and many lower priced wines has resulted in an increase in Crimson’s promotional expenditures, which include sales and marketing efforts to reach new customers and expand distribution of its products.  Crimson’s wines are primarily sold to distributors, who then sell to retailers and restaurants.  Consolidation at the distributor and retail level has increased which has added competitive pressure to increase marketing and sales spending and constrain pricing.  As permitted under federal and local regulations
, Crimson has also been placing increasing emphasis on sales direct to consumers, which they are able to do through the internet, wine clubs and at the wineries’ tasting rooms.  During 2010, direct sales to consumers represented 21% of case sales and 51% of wine revenues.  Wholesale sales of the Company’s wines in California (excluding direct sales to consumers) amounted to approximately 19% of 2010 wholesale wine revenues.




Crimson’s wines compete with small and large producers in the U.S., as well as with imported wines, and the ultimate consumer has many choices.  Demand for wine in the premium, ultra premium and luxury market segments can rise and fall with general economic conditions, and is also significantly affected by grape supply.  The demand for Crimson’s products is also affected by the ratings given the wines in industry and consumer publications.  In the current economic climate, consumer demand has shifted away from the higher-priced luxury segment to wines in the lower-priced premium and ultra premium categories.  While Crimson’s current vineyard holdings in the Napa, Willamette and Edna valleys continue to be a substantial source for its wine products, Crimson has and will continue
 to acquire more purchased fruit as it shifts its product offerings to the lower-priced wine segments.




The wineries’ production, sales and distribution activities are subject to regulation by agencies of both federal and state governments.  Recently, some states have increased and others have considered proposals to increase state alcohol taxes.  State regulations that prohibited or restricted sales of wine direct to consumers by producers that are located in another state continue to be amended or overturned to permit increased direct sales to consumers in other states.  For the year ended December 31, 2010, Crimson sold wine direct to consumers in 42 states across the U.S.

Energy Projects

 

During the past few years, the Company has been incurring costs to investigate and evaluate the development of a number of large scale domestic energy projects.  These projects plan to use gasification technology to convert different types of low grade fossil fuels into clean energy products.  The Company has also invested in certain energy projects that do not plan to use gasification technologies.  The Company has expensed costs to investigate, evaluate and obtain various permits and approvals for its various energy projects of $27,200,000, $25,300,000 and $33,400,000 during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.




Although there are a number of large scale projects the Company is currently investigating, the Company is not obligated to develop any of the projects, and no assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in fully developing any of these projects.  Any project that the Company might develop would likely require a significant equity investment, which the Company presently does not intend to fund by itself, the acquisition of substantial non-recourse borrowings to build the projects (total development costs for these types of projects range from $1 billion to $3 billion), the procurement of purchase commitments for long-term supplies of feedstock, long-term commitments from purchasers of the output, various permits and regulatory approvals and significant technological and engineering expertise to implement. 
; The investigation, evaluation and financing of these large scale projects will take years to complete.




The Company is currently evaluating the development of a gasification project which would be built in Louisiana by the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Lake Charles Cogeneration LLC (“LCC”), for an estimated total cost of between $2,300,000,000 and $2,600,000,000.  LCC has been awarded $1,561,000,000 in tax exempt bonds to support the development of the project which would be issued by the Lake Charles Harbor and Terminal District of Lake Charles, Louisiana.  Pursuant to LCC’s agreements with the local municipality, upon the completion of pending permitting, regulatory approval, design engineering and the satisfaction of certain other conditions of the financing agreements, the bonds will be marketed on a long-term basis and the proceeds will be released to LCC to use for the payment of de
velopment and construction costs for the project.  LCC has also been awarded $128,000,000 of investment tax credits and received a $260,000,000 federal government grant for carbon capture and sequestration.  The Company is not obligated to make equity contributions to LCC until it completes its investigation and the project is approved by the Company’s Board of Directors.  The Lake Charles Cogeneration project is a new chemical manufacturing project that plans to use quench gasification technology to produce energy products from low grade solid fuel sources such as petroleum coke.  LCC is evaluating the primary product options to be produced by the Lake Charles Cogeneration project including substitute natural gas, methanol and hydrogen.

 

In July 2009, two of the Company’s other prospective gasification projects, one in Indiana and the other in Mississippi, were selected by the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) to proceed to detailed due diligence and negotiations of terms and conditions necessary for the DOE to issue conditional commitments for loan guarantees aggregating up to $3,600,000,000.  While these commitments represent important milestones in the selection process, the guarantees are subject to detailed and extensive due diligence by the DOE and no assurance can be given that a loan guaranty for either project will ultimately be given.

Other Investments




Berkadia




Berkadia, a joint venture between Berkshire Hathaway and the Company, acquired a commercial mortgage origination and servicing business in December 2009.  The Company and Berkshire Hathaway each have a 50% equity interest in Berkadia, and each party contributed $217,200,000 of equity capital to fund the acquisition.  In addition, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway provided Berkadia with a five-year, $1 billion secured credit facility, which is used to fund mortgage loans and servicer advances, purchase mortgage servicing rights and for working capital needs.  In the fourth quarter of 2010, Berkadia’s secured credit facility was amended to increase the size of the credit facility to $1.5 billion, with the Company agreeing to provide the increased funds under the facility.  The increase in
 the size of the credit facility will enable Berkadia to hold new loan originations for a longer period prior to sale, generating interest income in excess of the interest due under the facility.  So long as there is no default under the credit facility, principal repayments will first be applied to the Company’s portion of the outstanding loan and then to Berkshire Hathaway’s portion.  In addition, the Company has the right to direct Berkadia to expedite its sale of loans under its various programs thereby reducing or eliminating the need for the additional funding.  Pursuant to the Company's amended guaranty to Berkshire Hathaway, any losses incurred under the facility will continue to be shared equally by the Company and Berkshire Hathaway.

 

The Company accounts for Berkadia as an investment in an associated company and applies the equity method of accounting.  For the year ended December 31, 2010 and the period ended December 31, 2009, the Company recorded income from Berkadia of $16,200,000 and $20,800,000, respectively, of which $24,400,000 in the 2009 period represented the Company’s share of a bargain purchase gain (for more information, see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations).  During 2010, the Company received cash dividends from Berkadia of $20,000,000.  At December 31, 2010, the carrying amount of the Company’s investment in and loans to Berkadia was $475,100,000.




The commercial mortgage servicing business provides primary, master and special servicing activities for commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”).  In addition, Berkadia carries out servicing activities on a contracted basis for third parties such as insurance companies, banks and other financial institutions.  Berkadia is an approved servicer of loans for Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae and the FHA, and is one of the largest servicers of commercial real estate loans in the U.S.  As of December 31, 2010, Berkadia had a servicing portfolio of approximately 28,000 loans with an unpaid principal balance of $214 billion summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):

Represents loans where Berkadia provides special servicing only. Berkadia is also the named special servicer on approximately $20 billion of loans for which it also acts as the primary or master servicer which are included on the line CMBS in the table above.







A primary servicer of a loan is the primary contact with the borrower and is generally responsible for carrying out all cash management functions relating to the loan, including providing monthly billing statements to the borrower and collecting and applying payments on the loan; administering reserve and escrow funds for repairs, tenant improvements, taxes and insurance; obtaining and analyzing operating and financial statements of the borrower and performing periodic property inspections; preparing and providing periodic reports and remittances to the master servicer or other designated persons; administering lien filings; and other specified functions.




  



19







  







A master servicer is responsible for administration of a pool of loans that is transferred to a trust or other special purpose entity in connection with a securitization transaction pursuant to a pooling and servicing agreement.  A master servicer is responsible for ensuring that primary servicers act in a diligent manner when carrying out their collection and administration activities, and is also required to handle all remittance and reporting activities required by the pooling and servicing agreement.  While some master servicer functions may be sub-contracted and performed by a primary servicer, as a master servicer Berkadia is ultimately responsible for the performance of any functions that have been sub-contracted to a primary servicer.




Master servicers are generally required to advance funds to cover any delinquent payments on the securitized loans and any taxes and insurance premiums not paid by borrowers or covered by borrowers’ escrow funds, provided that the servicer determines that the advances will be recoverable from loan payments or liquidation proceeds in the future.  These “servicing advances,” along with accrued interest, are treated as having priority over the rights of other investors in the securitization.  In certain circumstances, Berkadia may have similar obligations to advance funds in connection with loans under which it is a primary servicer.




A special servicer is a specialist in dealing with defaulted loans and is usually selected by the holder of the subordinated interest in a securitization vehicle.  Typically, a loan may be transferred from the master servicer to a special servicer if it is more than 60 days delinquent, a borrower files for bankruptcy or the master servicer determines a default is imminent.  Once a loan is transferred to special servicing, asset managers take steps to bring the account to a performing status or exercise other remedies, including loan modification, foreclosure, a negotiated pay-off or a sale of the loan.  Special servicers are generally paid higher monthly servicing fees and resolution fees in connection with the loans that they service.




Fee-for-service customers generally require the same type of collection, monitoring and reporting services as other programs; however, since the customer retains ownership of the loan there are no third party bondholders or investors.  In addition, the mortgage servicing rights are not purchased, instead the customer contracts with Berkadia to service its loans.  The contract usually has a defined term and may be terminated on short notice.




As a servicer, Berkadia is frequently responsible for managing, on behalf of its investors, the balances that are maintained in custodial accounts for the purposes of collecting and distributing principal and interest and for funding repairs, tenant improvements, taxes and insurance related to the mortgaged properties it services.  Berkadia derives certain economic benefits associated with a portion of these balances.  Such balances totaled in excess of $4 billion as of December 31, 2010.

 

Berkadia originates commercial real estate loans for Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae and the FHA using their underwriting guidelines, and will typically sell the loan shortly after it is funded.  Provided Berkadia adheres to the underwriting guidelines, these government related entities must purchase the loan at the face amount plus accrued interest; Berkadia retains the mortgage servicing rights.  In addition, as a condition to Fannie Mae’s delegation of responsibility for underwriting, originating and servicing of loans, Berkadia assumes a limited first-dollar loss position throughout the term of each loan sold to Fannie Mae.

 

During 2011, Berkadia plans to originate commercial mortgage loans which are not part of the government agency programs discussed above.  Berkadia will originate loans intended to be conveyed into CMBS transactions sponsored by third parties (“CMBS loans”) and provide interim financing to borrowers who intend to refinance such loans with an eligible government agency (“Bridge loans”).  Berkadia expects to hold CMBS loans for 3 to 6 months pending sale to a securitization vehicle and Bridge loans for up to 1 year pending refinance.  Berkadia intends that a maximum of $250,000,000 of CMBS loans and Bridge loans will be outstanding at any one time.

Berkadia is required under its servicing agreements to maintain certain minimum servicer ratings or qualifications from the rating agencies.  A downgrade below a certain level may give rise to the right of a customer or trustee of a securitized transaction to terminate Berkadia as servicer.  Berkadia currently maintains approvals or ratings from Moody’s Investors Service, Fitch Ratings, Standard & Poor’s and Dominion Bond Rating Services.  These ratings currently exceed the minimum ratings required by the related servicing agreements.  Ratings issued by the rating agencies can be withdrawn or lowered at any time.  In addition, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac retain broad discretion to terminate Berkadia as a seller/servicer without cause upon notice.




Jefferies




In April 2008, the Company sold to Jefferies 10,000,000 of the Company’s common shares, and received 26,585,310 shares of common stock of Jefferies and $100,021,000 in cash.  The Jefferies common shares were valued based on the closing price of the Jefferies common stock on April 18, 2008, the last trading date prior to the acquisition ($398,248,000 in the aggregate).  Including shares acquired in open market purchases, as of December 31, 2010, the Company owns an aggregate of 49,351,385 Jefferies common shares (approximately 28% of the Jefferies outstanding common shares) for a total investment of $812,400,000.  The Company’s investment in Jefferies is classified as an investment in an associated company and is carried at fair value, which was $1,314,200,000 at the December 31, 2010 closing m
arket price.  Jefferies has entered into a registration rights agreement covering all of the Jefferies common stock owned by the Company.  Jefferies is a full-service global investment bank and institutional securities firm serving companies and their investors.  Detailed financial and other information about Jefferies may be found on its website (www.jefferies.com).




In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), the Company is permitted to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value (the “fair value option”), and to report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option is elected in earnings.  The Company elected the fair value option to account for its investment in Jefferies rather than the equity method of accounting.  Income (losses) related to associated companies includes unrealized gains (losses) resulting from changes in the fair value of Jefferies of $143,300,000, $469,800,000 and $(111,200,000) for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.




JHYH




During 2007, the Company and Jefferies formed JHYH and each initially committed to invest $600,000,000.  The Company invested $250,000,000 in cash plus its $100,000,000 investment in JPOF II during 2007; any request for additional capital contributions from the Company will now require the consent of the Company’s designees to the Jefferies board.  The Company does not anticipate making additional capital contributions in the near future.  JHYH owns Jefferies High Yield Trading, LLC (“JHYT”), a registered broker-dealer that is engaged in the secondary sales and trading of high yield securities and special situation securities, including bank debt, post-reorganization equity, public and private equity, equity derivatives, credit default swaps and other financial instruments.  JH
YT makes markets in high yield and distressed securities and provides research coverage on these types of securities.  JHYT does not invest or make markets in sub-prime residential mortgage securities.




Jefferies and the Company each have the right to nominate two of a total of four directors to JHYH’s board, and each own 50% of the voting securities.  The organizational documents also permit passive investors to invest up to $800,000,000 in JHYH.  Jefferies also received additional JHYH securities entitling it to 20% of the profits.  The voting and non-voting interests are entitled to a pro rata share of the balance of the profits of JHYH, and are mandatorily redeemable in 2013, with an option to extend up to three additional one-year periods.  JHYH is considered a variable interest entity that is consolidated by Jefferies, since Jefferies is the primary beneficiary.  For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recorded pre-tax income (losses) from this in
vestment of $20,100,000, $37,200,000 and $(69,100,000), respectively, under the equity method of accounting; at December 31, 2010, the Company’s investment in JHYH was $321,000,000.

Fortescue




During 2006 and 2007, the Company invested an aggregate of $452,200,000 in Fortescue’s Pilbara iron ore and infrastructure project in Western Australia, including expenses.  In exchange for its cash investment, the Company received 277,986,000 common shares of Fortescue, and a $100,000,000 unsecured note of FMG that matures in August 2019.  In the first quarter of 2010, the Company sold 30,000,000 common shares for net cash proceeds of $121,500,000, reducing its interest in Fortescue to 247,986,000 common shares (approximately 8% of Fortescue’s outstanding common shares).  Interest on the note is calculated as 4% of the revenue, net of government royalties, invoiced from the iron ore produced from the project’s Cloud Break and Christmas Creek areas.  Fortescue is a publicly tra
ded company on the Australian Stock Exchange, and the shares acquired by the Company may be sold without restriction on the Australian Stock Exchange or in accordance with applicable securities laws.  The Company’s investment in the Fortescue common shares is classified as a non-current available for sale investment and carried at market value as of each balance sheet date.  At December 31, 2010, the market value of the Fortescue common shares was $1,659,600,000.




Interest on the FMG Note is payable semi-annually within 30 days of June 30th and December 31st of each year; however, cash interest payments due in 2008 and 2009 were deferred by FMG due to covenants contained in the project’s senior secured debt (for periods prior to January 1, 2010).  Any interest payment that was deferred earned simple interest at an annual rate of 9.5%.  Inasmuch as FMG’s senior secured debt was redeemed in 2010, the covenants requiring the deferral of interest no longer apply.  The Company recorded interest income on the FMG Note (including interest on deferred payments) of $149,300,000, $66,100,000 and $40,500,000 
for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  During 2010, the Company received $172,100,000 (before withholding taxes) from FMG in payment of accrued interest due through June 30, 2010.  In January 2011, the Company received $81,000,000 (before withholding taxes) from FMG in payment of interest due for the second half of 2010.  The ultimate value of the note will depend on the volume of iron ore shipped and iron ore prices over the remaining term of the note, which can fluctuate widely, as well as the outcome of the litigation described below.




The Company’s initial Fortescue investment was allocated to the common shares acquired, using the market value on the acquisition date, a 13 year zero-coupon note and a prepaid mining interest.  The zero-coupon note component of this investment is being accounted for as a loan-like instrument, with income being recognized as the note is accreted up to its face value of $100,000,000, using a rate of 12.5%.  It is classified with other non-current investments with a balance of $36,300,000 at December 31, 2010.  The prepaid mining interest, which is being amortized to expense as the 4% of revenue is earned, is classified as other current and non-current assets with an aggregate balance of $164,300,000 at December 31, 2010.  Depreciation and amortization expenses include prepaid mining interes
t amortization of $9,900,000, $7,300,000 and $2,800,000 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.




On August 9, 2010, the Company was advised that Fortescue is asserting that FMG is entitled to issue additional notes identical to the FMG Note in an unlimited amount.  Fortescue further claims that any interest to be paid on additional notes can dilute, on a pro rata basis, the Company’s entitlement to the stated interest of 4% of net revenue.  This claim was made four years after the issuance to the Company of the FMG Note, during which time Fortescue has never asserted this purported right to dilute the Company’s interest in any of Fortescue’s public filings or other communications.  The Company does not believe that FMG has the right to issue additional notes which affect the Company’s interest or that the interpretation by Fortescue of the terms of the FMG Note, as currently c
laimed by Fortescue, reflects the agreement between the parties.




On September 1, 2010, the Company filed a Writ of Summons against Fortescue, FMG and Fortescue’s Chief Executive Officer in the Supreme Court of Western Australia.  The Writ of Summons seeks, among other things, an injunction restraining the issuance of any additional notes identical to the FMG Note and damages.  If the litigation is ultimately determined adversely to the Company and additional notes are issued, the Company’s future cash flows from the FMG Note and future results of operations would be materially and adversely affected to the extent of the dilution resulting from the issuance of such additional notes.

During 2010, a Minerals Resource Rent Tax was proposed in Australia that would impact Fortescue if enacted by the Australian legislature; the proposed effective date of the tax is July 1, 2012.  Meetings between Australian government officials and mining companies in Australia are ongoing, and the initial proposal has changed and remains subject to further change.  When it was first proposed the extra tax burden did have an adverse impact on the market value of the Fortescue common shares held by the Company.  As currently proposed the tax will not have any impact on the calculation of the interest payable on the FMG Note.  Further, based on the Company’s review of available information concerning the proposed tax and its anticipated impact on Fortescue, the Company does not believe the pr
oposed tax is so onerous as to cause a liquidity problem for FMG resulting in FMG’s inability to service its debt obligations, including the FMG Note.  The Company does not believe that its zero-coupon note or prepaid mining interest are impaired or will become impaired as a result of the proposed tax.

 

The project information presented in the paragraphs below was obtained from Fortescue’s website, (www.fmgl.com.au), which contains substantial additional information about Fortescue, its operating activities and the project.  Fortescue shipped its first iron ore in May 2008 and for the year ending December 31, 2010, Fortescue’s total revenue from iron ore sales was $3,877,500,000.




Fortescue announced reserve estimates for the Cloud Break and Christmas Creek areas, which are net of mine depletion and ore recovery, include 98 million metric tons of proved iron ore reserves and 1.44 billion metric tons of probable iron ore reserves, in accordance with the Australasian Joint Ore Reserves Committee code.  This reserve estimate is solely for these two areas, which cover an area of approximately 770 square kilometers.  Fortescue has additional tenements in the Pilbara region of Western Australia and has since announced reserve estimates for some of its other tenements.  Although Fortescue has received all major approvals required under the various governmental, environmental, and native title processes for the Cloud Break and Christmas Creek tenements, it does not possess all of the appro
vals for mining activities at its other tenements.  Mining revenues derived from tenements other than Cloud Break and Christmas Creek do not increase the interest payable to the Company on the FMG note.




Fortescue’s initial feasibility study was commissioned to identify a quantity and quality of iron ore that would support an initial mine plan that produces 45 million metric tons per annum for a 20 year period.  In 2009 Fortescue launched a self-funded expansion program to increase its base mining plan to 55 million metric tons per annum from Cloud Break and Christmas Creek that it expects to begin commissioning in the first quarter of 2011.  In 2010 Fortescue announced a further expansion to increase its mining plan to 155 million metric tons per annum, of which 90 million metric tons per annum will come from Cloud Break and Christmas Creek.  Since the benchmark pricing system that historically determined iron ore prices collapsed in 2009, Fortescue has followed the lead of the largest iron ore pro
ducers and is charging its customers prices based on an index pricing regime that reflects recent iron ore spot prices.

 

In addition to the Company’s investment and equity investments from other parties, Fortescue initially raised $2,051,000,000 of senior secured debt to fund the construction of its infrastructure, which included a 260 kilometer railroad, port and related port infrastructure at Port Hedland, Australia, as well as a crushing and screening plant, access roads and other infrastructure at the mine site.  During 2010, Fortescue redeemed its senior secured debt and borrowed additional amounts to fund expansion activities.  At December 31, 2010, Fortescue had $3,540,000,000 of senior unsecured notes outstanding.




Inmet




Inmet is a Canadian-based global mining company traded on the Toronto stock exchange (Symbol: IMN).  In August 2005, the Company sold to Inmet a 70% interest in Cobre Las Cruces, a Spanish company that holds the exploration and mineral rights to the Las Cruces copper deposit in the Pyrite Belt of Spain, in exchange for 5,600,000 common shares of Inmet.  In November 2010, the Company sold to Inmet its remaining 30% equity interest in and subordinated sponsor loans to Las Cruces for aggregate consideration of $576,000,000.  The purchase price was comprised of $150,000,000 of cash and 5,442,413 newly issued common shares of Inmet, which were valued at the market price of the Inmet common shares on the closing date of the transaction.  In addition, the Company was released from its guarantee of $7
2,000,000 of debt owed by Las Cruces to an affiliate of Inmet.  The Company reported a gain on the sale of $383,400,000 in investment and other income.  At December 31, 2010, the Company owns a total of 11,042,413 Inmet common shares which are reflected on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at market value of $862,500,000 (approximately 18% of Inmet’s outstanding common shares).  Pursuant to the rules of the Toronto Stock Exchange, the newly acquired Inmet common shares may not be sold until April 2011.  The Inmet shares have registration rights and may be sold in accordance with applicable securities laws, subject to the restriction for the shares acquired in 2010.  Detailed financial and other information about Inmet may be found on its website (www.inmetmining.com).

In January 2011, Inmet announced that it had entered into an agreement with Lundin Mining Corporation (“Lundin”) pursuant to which shareholders of Inmet and Lundin will receive new common shares of an amalgamated corporation named Symterra Corporation (“Symterra”) containing all of the assets of both companies.  The Company entered into a voting and support agreement with Lundin pursuant to which it has agreed to vote all of the Inmet common shares it owns in favor of the transaction, subject to customary conditions.  While the voting and support agreement remains in effect the Company will not be able to sell any of the Inmet shares it owns.  The voting and support agreement will terminate if the merger is not completed by June 30, 2011.  Based on the announced terms of 
the transaction, if it is consummated the Company expects to own approximately 9% of Symterra.  Closing of the transaction is subject to closing conditions that are customary under Canadian law for this type of transaction.




Garcadia




The Company has entered into a joint venture agreement with Garff Enterprises, Inc. (“Garff”) pursuant to which the joint venture has acquired various automobile dealerships.  The joint venture agreement specifies that the Company and Garff shall have equal board representation and equal votes on all matters affecting Garcadia, and that all cash flows from Garcadia will be allocated 65% to the Company and 35% to Garff, which reflects that the Company made a larger equity investment.  Garcadia’s strategy is to acquire automobile dealerships in secondary market locations meeting its specified return criteria.  As of December 31, 2010, Garcadia owned 14 dealerships comprised of domestic and foreign automobile makers.  The Company has received cash distributions of fees and earning
s aggregating $8,800,000, $6,100,000 and $6,500,000 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  In addition, the Company owns the land for certain dealerships and leases it to the dealerships for rent aggregating $5,100,000, $5,000,000 and $3,800,000 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  At December 31, 2010, the Company’s investment in Garcadia (excluding the land) was classified as an investment in associated company with a carrying value of $35,900,000.




During 2009, the Company’s equity in losses of Garcadia includes impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets aggregating $32,300,000.  Garcadia’s automobile dealerships had been adversely impacted by general economic conditions, and the bankruptcy filings by two of the three largest U.S. automobile manufacturers in 2009 was a change in circumstances that caused Garcadia to evaluate the recoverability of its goodwill and other intangible assets.  None of Garcadia’s automobile dealerships were closed as a result of the restructuring of the U.S. automobile manufacturers.  During 2010, Garcadia did lose two franchises when General Motors announced it was going to discontinue Pontiac.




Other




In June 2007, the Company invested $200,000,000 to acquire a 10% limited partnership interest in Pershing Square IV, L.P. (“Pershing Square”), a newly-formed private investment partnership whose investment decisions are at the sole discretion of Pershing Square’s general partner.  The stated objective of Pershing Square was to create significant capital appreciation by investing in Target Corporation.  The Company recorded income (losses) under the equity method of accounting from this investment of $3,000,000, $(3,200,000) and $(77,700,000) in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, principally resulting from declines in the market value of Target Corporation’s common stock.  During 2010, the Company redeemed its interest in Pershing Square by transferring its equity into a larger, mor
e diversified investment partnership managed by the same manager.  The Company’s percentage ownership interest in this larger investment partnership is much smaller and does not qualify for the equity method of accounting.




The Company beneficially owns equity interests representing more than 5% of the outstanding capital stock of each of the following domestic public companies at February 17, 2011 (determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934):  Jefferies (27.8%), HomeFed (31.4%) and International Assets Holding Corporation (7.7%).  In addition to the Company’s equity interests in Fortescue and Inmet discussed above, the Company also owns a 7.0% equity interest in JZ Capital Partners Limited, a British company traded on the London Stock Exchange.

For further information about the Company’s business, including the Company’s investments, reference is made to Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Report and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.




Item 1A.  Risk Factors.

 

Our business is subject to a number of risks.  You should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Report, before you decide whether to purchase our common stock.  The risks set out below are not the only risks we face.  If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.




Future acquisitions and dispositions of our operations and investments are possible, changing the components of our assets and liabilities, and if unsuccessful could reduce the value of our common shares.  Any future acquisitions or dispositions may result in significant changes in the composition of our assets and liabilities. Consequently, our financial condition, results of operations and the trading price of our common shares may be affected by factors different from those affecting our financial condition, results of operations and trading price at the present time.




We are dependent on certain key personnel.  We are dependent on the services of Ian M. Cumming and Joseph S. Steinberg, our Chairman of the Board and President, respectively.  Messrs. Cumming’s and Steinberg’s employment agreements with us expire June 30, 2015.  These individuals are also significant shareholders of our Company.  As of February 17, 2011, Messrs. Cumming and Steinberg and trusts for the benefit of their respective families (excluding certain private charitable foundations) beneficially owned approximately 9.7% and 10.8% of our outstanding common shares, respectively.  Accordingly, Messrs. Cumming and Steinberg exert significant influence over all matters requiring approval by our shareholders, incl
uding the election or removal of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions.




We operate in a variety of industries and market sectors, all of which are very competitive and susceptible to economic downturns and have been adversely affected by recent economic conditions.  Starting in 2008, the recession and general economic conditions have adversely affected operating results in the manufacturing, oil and gas drilling services, gaming entertainment and domestic real estate segments, which is likely to continue until the economy recovers.  The performance of these business units during this period has resulted in a lower valuation for these businesses, and a worsening of general economic or market conditions could result in a further deterioration in the values of our businesses or investments.




Declines in the U.S. housing market have reduced revenues and profitability of the manufacturing businesses and may continue to do so.  Our manufacturing operations, in particular Idaho Timber, have generated significant revenues when the U.S. housing market was strong.  The weak U.S. housing market during the last few years has resulted in fewer new housing starts, which has adversely impacted revenues and profitability at Idaho Timber.  Idaho Timber does not expect to return to prior levels of profitability until the U.S. housing market recovers.




The prices and availability of key raw materials affects the profitability of our manufacturing operations, and also impacts Sangart’s ability to conduct its clinical trials.  Although the Company’s operating subsidiaries are not currently experiencing any shortage of raw materials, if the subsidiaries experience shortages, revenues and profitability of the manufacturing subsidiaries would decline.  Sangart has access to sufficient raw materials to conduct its clinical trials; however, it has not secured commitments for sufficient raw materials for a commercial launch, which would also require additional investments in manufacturing capacity.  In addition, the cost of polypropylene, the principal raw material used by Conwed Plastics, has 
increased by approximately 146% from 2002.  The price of polypropylene has historically fluctuated with the price of oil and natural gas but growing economies in China and India have resulted in increased demand and impacted prices.




  



25







  







Keen’s revenues and profitability are impacted by natural gas and oil supplies and prices and the supply of drilling rigs in the marketplace.   During periods of decreased demand for natural gas and oil, Keen’s rig utilization will decline and Keen’s competitors may also have excess capacity in the marketplace, which adversely impacts Keen’s revenues and profitability.




The lack of liquidity in the capital markets could adversely affect exploration, production and development activities of Keen’s customers, which could cause a reduction in Keen’s rig utilization and profitability.  The combination of low natural gas prices, the volatility and level of oil prices and the lack of liquidity in the capital markets could force Keen’s customers to reduce drilling programs, impair their ability to sustain their current level of operations and could adversely impact their ability to meet their cash obligations.  In addition to reduced rig utilization and profitability, which could result in impairment charges for certain rigs, difficulties experienced by Keen’s customers could increase Keen’s bad debt ex
pense.




The nature of Keen’s operating activities can be hazardous, and accidents can cause personal injury or death, damage to Keen’s equipment and/or environmental damage.  These hazards are inherent in the contract drilling business, and if Keen is not fully protected through insurance coverage or indemnification from its customers any such accidents could adversely impact Keen’s profitability.  Keen maintains insurance coverage and has indemnification agreements with many of its customers; however, there is no assurance that such insurance or indemnification agreements would adequately protect Keen against liability or loss from all consequences of any accidents.  Additionally, Keen may not be able to purchase insurance economically.</f
ont>




New technologies could cause Keen’s drilling equipment and methods to become less competitive, resulting in reduced profitability or a requirement to make significant capital investments to remain competitive.  Improvements in drilling technology could cause Keen to become less competitive, lose business, suffer reduced profitability or result in impairment charges with respect to its drilling equipment.




When drilling pursuant to footage or turnkey contracts, Keen could incur unexpected cost overruns which could negatively impact Keen’s profitability.  Keen typically provides contract drilling services under daywork contracts under which Keen’s customers assume most of the risks associated with drilling operations.  If Keen enters footage or turnkey contracts, Keen is paid a fixed amount, regardless of the time required or operational problems encountered.  Keen typically pays more of the out-of-pocket operating costs on a footage or turnkey contract versus daywork contract.




The Hard Rock Biloxi is dependent upon patronage of persons living in the Gulf Coast region. The Hard Rock Biloxi primarily seeks to attract patrons from its local geographic area.  Downturns in local and regional economic conditions, an increase in competition in the surrounding area and interruptions caused by hurricanes could negatively impact operating results.




We may not be able to insure certain risks economically.  We cannot be certain that we will be able to insure all risks that we desire to insure economically or that all of our insurers or reinsurers will be financially viable if we make a claim.  If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits should occur, or if the Company is required to pay a deductible for an insured loss, results of operations could be adversely affected.  Premier has been severely damaged by hurricanes in the past, and it is possible that storms could cause significant damage in the future.  Damages from storms could result in Premier closing its facility to make repairs, resulting in lost business and adversely affecting results of operations.</div
>




Increases in mortgage interest rate levels, the lack of available consumer credit and the depressed real estate market have reduced and may continue to reduce consumer demand for certain of our real estate development projects and result in impairment charges.  Due to current depressed economic conditions in the national real estate market, most of the Company’s real estate development projects are not being marketed for sale.  If the Company begins to market its development projects in the future, the ability to successfully attract customers will be highly dependent upon consumers’ ability to finance real estate purchases with affordable loans.  If the Company is unable to realize its projected cash flows for its development projects, i
mpairment charges are likely.

Sangart is subject to extensive government regulation, cannot generate any revenue without regulatory approval of its products and is also subject to all of the risks inherent in establishing a new business.  The Company has invested approximately $161,500,000 in Sangart, principally to help fund Sangart’s product development activities.  While these funds are generally expensed by Sangart when spent, the Company cannot be assured that it will ever receive a return on its investment due to the risky nature of Sangart’s development activities.  Clinical trials of Sangart’s product candidates are not complete, the products have not been approved for sale by regulatory authorities and there is a risk that its products may never prove e
ffective or be approved.




There are other companies developing products for the same market that Sangart is targeting, and if they are successful in bringing their product to market before Sangart it may significantly impair Sangart’s ability to compete in the same market segment.  Even if Sangart is successful in obtaining regulatory approval to sell its products, competitors may receive approval prior to Sangart and/or have more effective products which could reduce demand for Sangart’s products.




Sangart’s success depends on its ability to obtain, maintain and defend patent protection for its products and technologies, preserve trade secrets and operate without infringing on the intellectual property rights of others.  The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies, such as Sangart, are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions.  If Sangart’s intellectual property positions are challenged, invalidated, circumvented or expire, or if Sangart fails to maintain its third-party intellectual property licenses in good standing, its ability to successfully bring MP4 products to market would be adversely affected, it could incur monetary liabilities or be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute.<
/div>




Sangart will require significant additional funding for product development and clinical trial activities prior to regulatory approval and commercial launch; the source of such funding has not been identified.  The Company expects to provide Sangart with sufficient capital through the end of 2011.   Sangart has had discussions with third-party investors; however, no agreements have been reached and if such agreements are entered into it would likely result in significant dilution of the Company’s interest.  The Company has not determined whether it will continue to provide funds to Sangart and if so how much it will provide.  If Sangart is not provided with additional funds from either the Company or other sources when needed, it
 is unlikely that the Company will ever realize any significant return of its invested capital.




The Company has incurred costs to investigate and evaluate the development of a number of large scale energy projects; however, development of these projects is subject to obtaining significant third-party debt and equity financing, regulatory approvals, the procurement of purchase commitments for long-term supplies of feedstock and securing long-term commitments from purchasers of the output.  Although the Company has spent material amounts in the investigation of large scale energy projects, it will not be able to develop these projects without financing from other sources, various regulatory approvals and commitments from third-parties.  The timing of the commencement of construction of any project is also dependent upon the receipt of financing and regulat
ory approvals.  If the Company is unable to obtain such financing, approvals or commitments, it will not be able to recover its investment.




If Berkadia does not maintain certain specified ratings from the credit rating agencies it could lose its mortgage servicing rights.  Berkadia is required to maintain specified ratings from the credit rating agencies, and failure to do so would give its customers the right to terminate their mortgage servicing agreements.  If mortgage servicing agreements were terminated as a result of a credit ratings downgrade, the Company could lose its entire equity investment and may be exposed to loss for some or all of its exposure on the Berkadia secured credit facility.

When Berkadia originates loans for Fannie Mae, it is often required to share in the losses on such loans, which could be in excess of reserved amounts.  Berkadia carries a reserve on its balance sheet for contingent losses on loans originated for Fannie Mae that have loss sharing requirements.  If actual losses exceed amounts reserved, Berkadia’s profitability and cash flows will be reduced.




The loss of or changes in Berkadia’s relationships with U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprises and federal agencies would have an adverse effect on Berkadia’s business.  Berkadia’s status as an approved seller/servicer for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and its status as an FHA-approved mortgagee and issuer of Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities afford Berkadia a number of advantages.  Berkadia’s failure to comply with the applicable U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprise or agency standards (financial and otherwise) may result in its termination as an approved seller/servicer, mortgagee or issuer.  The loss of any such status could have a material adverse impact on Berkadia’s results of operations, could result in a loss of 
similar approvals from other U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprises or federal agencies and could have other adverse consequences to the business.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac retain broad discretion to terminate Berkadia as a seller/servicer without cause upon notice.




Changes in existing government-sponsored and federal mortgage programs could negatively affect Berkadia’s business.  Berkadia’s ability to generate income through mortgage sales to institutional investors depends in part on programs sponsored by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the FHA, which facilitate the issuance of mortgage-backed securities in the secondary market.  These programs have been reduced in recent periods due to current economic conditions.  Any discontinuation of, or significant reduction in, the operation of those programs could have a material adverse effect on Berkadia’s loan origination and servicing business and results of operations.  Also, any significant adverse change in the level of activity in the se
condary market or the underwriting criteria of these entities could negatively impact Berkadia’s results of operations and cash flows.




Berkadia’s special servicing and fee-for-service businesses may be terminated on short notice.  Special servicing for each CMBS transaction is usually controlled by the subordinated bond holder class of the securitization.  The owners of the subordinated bonds may change from time to time, and subordinated bond holders may replace Berkadia with a different special servicer.  Fee-for-service customers are permitted to terminate Berkadia on short notice, usually 30 days.  If Berkadia loses special servicing rights or is terminated by fee-for-service customers, it would negatively impact Berkadia’s results of operations and cash flows.




Proposed CMBS and Bridge loan programs will expose Berkadia to credit and interest rate risk that it is not subject to with its government agency lending programs.  Unlike its government agency lending programs, Berkadia cannot be assured it will be able to sell CMBS and Bridge loans at par value to a third-party without any exposure to credit or interest rate risk.  If for any reason Berkadia is unable to sell a CMBS loan into the securization market or refinance a Bridge loan, it will retain all risks associated with such loan for as long as it owns the loan.  Berkadia may be forced to sell such loans to a third party at a discount, which would reduce Berkadia’s profitability and cash flows.




Berkadia’s business is significantly affected by general economic conditions, particularly in the commercial real estate industry, and could be harmed in the event of a continued economic slowdown, prolonged recession or other market downturn or disruption.  Berkadia’s business and earnings are sensitive to changes in government policies and regulations, changes in interest rates, inflation, deflation, oversupply of real estate properties, fluctuations in the real estate and debt capital markets and developments in national and local economies.  Unfavorable economic conditions could have an adverse effect on Berkadia’s business, including decreasing the demand for new loans and the servicing of loans originated by third parties.

The Company has a substantial investment in Jefferies, an investment banking and securities firm whose operating results are greatly affected by the economy and financial markets.  Although Jefferies’ operating results showed great improvement during the last two years, during 2008, turmoil in the equity and credit markets had an adverse effect on the volume and size of transactions Jefferies executed for its customers, resulting in reduced revenues and profitability in its investment banking, asset management and trading activities, as well as losses in its principal trading activities.  Future declines in Jefferies operating results caused by these or other conditions could adversely affect the value of the Company’s investment.

 

New financial legislation could affect the market value of the Company’s investment in Jefferies.  Recently adopted legislation in the U.S. will result in more comprehensive regulation of the financial services industry.  Such regulation could have an adverse impact on the market value of the Company’s investment in Jefferies.




The Company has substantial investments in Fortescue and Inmet, entities which are engaged in the mining of base metals (principally iron ore and copper), the prices of which have been volatile and can reduce the value of the Company’s investments.  The value of the Company’s investment in the base metals mining sector rise and fall with the changes in the underlying base metal prices.  In addition, mining operations are often subject to delay and regulatory scrutiny, which can increase costs or delay bringing mines into full production.  Pricing changes and mining delays have a direct impact on the value of the Company’s investments, and could adversely impact results of operations and equity.




The value of the FMG Note could be materially reduced if the Company loses its litigation against Fortescue.  If the litigation is ultimately determined adversely to the Company and additional notes are issued, the Company’s future cash flows from the FMG Note and future results of operations would be materially and adversely affected to the extent of the dilution resulting from the issuance of such additional notes.  In addition, depending upon the extent of any such dilution, the Company might have to record an impairment charge for its prepaid mining interest.




A Minerals Resource Rent Tax was proposed in Australia that if enacted by the Australian legislature could adversely impact the value of the Company’s investment in Fortescue’s common shares.  Meetings between Australian government officials and mining companies in Australia are ongoing, and the initial proposal has changed and remains subject to further change.  When it was first proposed the extra tax burden did have an adverse impact on the market value of the Fortescue common shares held by the Company.  As currently proposed, the tax will not have any impact on the calculation of the interest payable on the FMG Note.  The Company’s investment in Fortescue’s common shares could decline if and when the tax is enac
ted, depending upon its final form.




Garcadia’s business is dependent, in part, upon revenue from new and used car sales at its dealerships, and declines in revenues due to industry or other factors could result in reduced profitability, reduced cash flows and/or impairment charges.  Garcadia has recorded impairment charges in the past, principally for goodwill and other intangible assets, and if the automobile industry experiences a downturn in the future additional impairment charges are likely.  In addition, reduced revenues would result in reduced profitability and cash flows for the Company.




From time to time the Company may invest in illiquid securities that are subject to standstill agreements or otherwise restricted.  From time to time the Company may invest in securities that are subject to restrictions which prohibit the Company from selling the securities for a period of time.  Currently, the Company’s investment in Inmet is subject to a voting and support agreement that prohibits the Company from selling its Inmet shares during the pendency of Inmet’s merger transaction with Lundin.  The voting and support agreement will terminate if the merger is not completed by June 30, 2011.  Should the Company need to generate liquidity quickly, the agreement would limit the Company’s ability to dispose of this inv
estment while the agreement is effective.

The Company has significant investments in publicly traded securities and changes in the market prices of these securities, particularly during times of increased volatility in security prices, can have a material impact on the Company’s investment portfolio, equity and, for certain investments, on results of operations.  The Company has significant investments in publicly traded securities, principally Fortescue, Jefferies and Inmet, and in JHYH, an operating business that typically owns publicly traded securities.  Changes in the market values of publicly traded available for sale securities, such as Fortescue and Inmet, are reflected in other comprehensive income (loss) and equity but not in the consolidated statement of operations.  However, changes in the market value of
 Jefferies, for which the Company has elected the fair value option, declines in the fair values of equity securities that the Company deems to be other than temporary and declines in the fair values of debt securities related to credit losses are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and equity.  The Company’s investment in JHYH is accounted for on the equity method of accounting for which the Company records its share of JHYH’s profits or losses in its consolidated statements of operations.  To the extent that JHYH owns public securities, with changes in market values reflected in its earnings, this increases the Company’s exposure to volatility in the public securities markets.  Global securities markets have been highly volatile, and continued volatility may have a material negative impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations.

 

Changes in government tax policies in foreign or domestic jurisdictions where the Company has investments could have an adverse impact on the value of those investments.  The Company has significant investments in both domestic and foreign businesses, where local and national government tax policies in the jurisdictions where those businesses operate could have a material adverse impact on the value of those investments.  Government budget deficits may result in legislation to increase or add new taxes on businesses, in particular the domestic financial services and foreign mining sectors.  The Company has equity investments and/or loans to businesses operating in those sectors, and the announcement of unfavorable taxation policy or regulation for those businesses has had and could
 continue to have an adverse impact on the values of those investments, and reduce cash flows to the Company.




Current economic conditions have adversely affected most of the Company’s operations and investments.  A worsening of current economic conditions or a prolonged recession could cause a decline in estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by certain of the Company’s operations and investments, potentially resulting in impairment charges for long-lived assets.  Certain of the Company’s operating businesses and investments have significant investments in long-lived assets, in particular manufacturing, oil and gas drilling services and gaming entertainment.  Current economic conditions have resulted in declining revenues for these operations and their property and equipment is not being fully utilized.  As required,
 the Company will review certain of these assets and investments for potential impairment, and except as otherwise disclosed has not concluded that the book values of these long-lived assets are not recoverable.  If the operating revenues of these businesses deteriorate in the future, and/or the Company lowers its estimates of future cash flows, impairment charges might have to be recorded.




We could experience significant increases in operating costs and reduced profitability due to competition for skilled management and staff employees in our operating businesses.  The Company competes with many other entities for skilled management and staff employees, including entities that operate in different market sectors than the Company.  Costs to recruit and retain adequate personnel could adversely affect results of operations.




From time to time we are subject to litigation, for which we may be unable to accurately assess our level of exposure and which if adversely determined, may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.  The Company and its subsidiaries are or may become parties to legal proceedings that are considered to be either ordinary, routine litigation incidental to their business or not material to the Company’s consolidated financial position or liquidity.  However, adverse determinations in specific legal matters could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

We may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to fully realize our deferred tax asset.  At December 31, 2010, we have recognized a net deferred tax asset of $1,175,600,000.  If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income, we will not be able to fully realize the recorded amount of the net deferred tax asset, or if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of our NOLs, the NOLs would expire unused.  The Company’s projections of future taxable income required to fully realize the recorded amount of the net deferred tax asset reflect numerous assumptions about our operating businesses and investments, and are subject to change as conditions change specific to our business units, investments or g
eneral economic conditions.  Changes that are adverse to the Company could result in the need to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance resulting in a charge to results of operations and a decrease to total stockholders’ equity.




The payment of dividends in the future is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors.  Although the Company paid a dividend in 2010, it did not pay any dividend in 2009 or 2008.  The Company does not have a regular dividend policy and any dividends actually paid are determined each year by the Board of Directors.




Our common shares are subject to transfer restrictions.  We and certain of our subsidiaries have significant NOLs and other tax attributes, the amount and availability of which are subject to certain qualifications, limitations and uncertainties.  In order to reduce the possibility that certain changes in ownership could result in limitations on the use of the tax attributes, our certificate of incorporation contains provisions that generally restrict the ability of a person or entity from acquiring ownership (including through attribution under the tax law) of 5% or more of our common shares and the ability of persons or entities now owning 5% or more of our common shares from acquiring additional common shares.  The restriction will remain until th
e earliest of (a) December 31, 2024, (b) the repeal of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (or any comparable successor provision) and (c) the beginning of a taxable year to which these tax benefits may no longer be carried forward.  The restriction may be waived by our Board of Directors.  Shareholders are advised to carefully monitor their ownership of our common shares and consult their own legal advisors and/or us to determine whether their ownership of our common shares approaches the proscribed level.
