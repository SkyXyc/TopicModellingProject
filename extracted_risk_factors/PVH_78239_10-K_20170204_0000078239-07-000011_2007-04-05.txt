Item 1A. Risk Factors

Our substantial level of debt could impair our financial condition.

We had approximately $400 million of long-term debt, $120 million of outstanding letters of credit and $205 million of additional amounts available for borrowing as of February 4, 2007. Our significant level of debt could have important consequences to investors, including:

·
requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations be used for the payment of interest on our debt, thereby reducing the funds available to us for our operations or other capital needs;

·
limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate because our available cash flow after paying principal and interest on our debt may not be sufficient to make the capital and other expenditures necessary to address these changes;

·
increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions because, during periods in which we experience lower earnings and cash flow, we will be required to devote a proportionally greater amount of our cash flow to paying principal and interest on our debt;

·
limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate requirements;

·
placing us at a competitive disadvantage to other relatively less leveraged competitors that have more cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate requirements; and

·
any borrowings we make at variable interest rates, including our revolving credit facility, leave us vulnerable to increases in interest rates generally.

We may not be able to continue to realize revenue growth from Calvin Klein.

A significant portion of our business strategy involves growing our Calvin Klein business. Our realization of revenue growth from Calvin Klein will depend largely upon our ability to:

·
continue to maintain and enhance the distinctive brand identity of Calvin Klein;

·
continue to maintain good working relationships with Calvin Klein’s licensees;

·
continue to enter into new licensing agreements for the Calvin Klein brands, both domestically and internationally;

·
successfully design and market the Calvin Klein men’s better sportswear line over time; and

·
continue to open Calvin Klein outlet retail stores in premium outlet malls and successfully operate over time a chain of such stores.

We cannot assure you that we can successfully execute any of these actions or our growth strategy for the Calvin Klein brands, nor can we assure you that the launch of any Calvin Klein branded products by us or our licensees or that the continued offering of these lines will achieve the degree of consistent success necessary to generate profits or positive cash flow. Our ability to successfully carry out our growth strategy may be affected by, among other things, our ability to enhance our relationships with existing customers to obtain additional selling space and develop new relationships with apparel retailers, economic and competitive conditions, changes in consumer spending patterns and changes in consumer tastes and style trends. If we fail to develop and grow successfully the Calvin Klein business, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.

The success of Calvin Klein depends on the value of our Calvin Klein brands, and if the value of those brands were to diminish, our business could be adversely affected.

Our success depends on our brands and their value. The Calvin Klein name is integral to the existing Calvin Klein business, as well as to our strategies for continuing to grow and expand Calvin Klein. The Calvin Klein brands could be adversely affected if Mr. Klein’s public image or reputation were to be tarnished.

A substantial portion of our revenues and gross profit is derived from a small number of large customers and the loss of any of these customers could substantially reduce our revenues.

A few of our customers, including Federated Department Stores, Inc., J. C. Penney Company, Inc., Kohl’s Corporation and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., account for significant portions of our revenues. Sales to our five largest customers were 30.6% of our revenues in 2006, 34.3% of our revenues in 2005 and 28.8% of our revenues in 2004. Federated, our largest customer, accounted for 11.4% of our revenues in 2006 and 13.7% of our revenues in 2005. We do not have long-term agreements with any of our customers and purchases generally occur on an order-by-order basis. A decision by any of our major customers, whether motivated by marketing strategy, competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to decrease significantly the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing or other business partners, or to change their manner of doing business with us or our licensing or other business partners, could substantia
lly reduce our revenues and materially adversely affect our profitability. The retail industry has recently experienced a great deal of consolidation and other ownership changes and we expect such changes to be ongoing. For example, in August 2005, Federated acquired The May Department Stores Company and has closed approximately 80 stores. Store closings will decrease the number of stores carrying our apparel products, while the remaining stores may purchase a smaller amount of our products and may reduce the retail floor space designated for our brands. Federated may also close additional stores, which could further reduce our revenues. In the future, retailers may further consolidate, undergo restructurings or reorganizations, realign their affiliations or reposition their stores’ target markets. Any of these types of actions could decrease the number of stores that carry our products or increase the ownership concentration within the retail industry. These changes could decrease our opportunitie
s in the market, increase our reliance on a smaller number of large customers and decrease our negotiating strength with our customers. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Our business could be adversely affected by financial instability experienced by our customers.

During the past several years, various retailers have experienced significant financial difficulties, which have resulted in bankruptcies, liquidations and store closings. We sell our products primarily to national and regional department, mid-tier department and mass market stores in the United States on credit and evaluate each customer’s financial condition on a regular basis in order to determine the credit risk we take in selling goods to them. The financial difficulties of a customer could cause us to curtail business with that customer and we may be unable to shift sales to another viable customer. We may also assume more credit risk relating to receivables of a customer experiencing financial instability. Should these circumstances arise with respect to our customers, our inability to shift sales or to collect on our trade accounts receivable from any one of our customers could substantially reduce our revenues and have a mater
ial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

We primarily use foreign suppliers for our products and raw materials, which poses risks to our business operations.

During 2006, in excess of 98% of our apparel products, excluding neckwear, were produced by and purchased or procured from independent manufacturers located in countries in the Far East, the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East, the Caribbean and Central America. On May 15, 2006, we closed our apparel manufacturing facility in Ozark, Alabama. As a result, with the exception of neckwear, 100% of our products will be produced by independent third parties, principally located in foreign countries. Approximately 60% of our neckwear is produced by independent third parties, principally located in foreign countries. We believe that we are one of the largest procurers of shirting fabric in the world. Additionally, our footwear products and the raw materials therefor were produced by and purchased or procured from manufacturers located principally in countries in the Far East, Europe, South America and the Caribbean and our neckwear fabric was prod
uced by or procured from manufacturers in Europe and the Far East. Although no single supplier and no one country is critical to our production needs, any of the following could materially and adversely affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and, as a result, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations:

·
political or labor instability in countries where contractors and suppliers are located;

·
political or military conflict involving the United States, which could cause a delay in the transportation of our products and raw materials to us and an increase in transportation costs;



20



·
heightened terrorism security concerns, which could subject imported or exported goods to additional, more frequent or more thorough inspections, leading to delays in deliveries or impoundment of goods for extended periods or could result in decreased scrutiny by customs officials for counterfeit goods, leading to lost sales, increased costs for our anti-counterfeiting measures and damage to the reputation of our brands;

·
a significant decrease in availability or increase in cost of raw materials, particularly petroleum-based synthetic fabrics, which are currently in high demand;

·
disease epidemics and health-related concerns, such as the SARS outbreak and the mad cow and hoof-and-mouth disease outbreaks in recent years and current concerns over an avian flu pandemic, which could result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas;

·
the migration and development of manufacturers, which could affect where our products are or are planned to be produced;

·
imposition of regulations, quotas and safeguards relating to imports and our ability to adjust timely to changes in trade regulations, which, among other things, could limit our ability to produce products in cost-effective countries that have the labor and expertise needed;

·
imposition of duties, taxes and other charges on imports;

·
significant fluctuation of the value of the dollar against foreign currencies; and

·
restrictions on transfers of funds out of countries where our foreign licensees are located.

If our manufacturers fail to use acceptable ethical business practices, our business could suffer.

We require our manufacturers to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations regarding working conditions, employment practices and environmental compliance. Additionally, we impose upon our business partners operating guidelines that require additional obligations in those areas in order to promote ethical business practices, and our staff and third parties we retain for such purposes periodically visit and monitor the operations of our independent manufacturers to determine compliance. However, we do not control our independent manufacturers or their labor and other business practices. If one of our manufacturers violates labor or other laws or implements labor or other business practices that are generally regarded as unethical in the United States, the shipment of finished products to us could be interrupted, orders could be cancelled, relationships could be terminated and our reputation could be damaged. Any of the
se events could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and, consequently, our results of operations.

Our reliance on independent manufacturers could cause delay and damage customer relationships.

In 2006, we relied upon independent third parties for the manufacture of more than 98% of our apparel products and 100% of our footwear products. On May 15, 2006, we closed our apparel manufacturing facility in Ozark, Alabama. As a result, 100% of our products, with the exception of neckwear, will be produced by independent third parties. We produce approximately 40% of our neckwear in our domestic manufacturing facility, and the remaining 60% of our neckwear is produced by independent third parties. We do not have long-term contracts with any of our suppliers. A manufacturer’s failure to ship products to us in a timely manner or to meet required quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers for those products. As a result, customers could cancel their orders, refuse to accept deliveries or demand reduced prices. Any of these actions taken by our customers could have a material adverse effect 
on our revenues and, consequently, our results of operations.

We are dependent on a limited number of distribution and neckwear manufacturing facilities.  If one becomes inoperable, our business, financial condition and operating results could be negatively impacted. 
 
We operate a limited number of distribution facilities, and approximately 40% of our neckwear is produced in only one facility that we lease. Our ability to meet the needs of our retail customers and of our own retail stores depends on the proper operation of our primary facilities. If any of our primary facilities were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason, we could have a substantial loss of inventory and/or disruptions of deliveries to our customers and our stores, and/or incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with the distribution of our products during the time it takes to reopen or replace the facility. This could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.

A significant portion of our revenues is dependent on royalties and licensing.

In 2006, $241.5 million, or 11.6%, of our revenues were derived from licensing royalties, advertising and other revenues, principally in our Calvin Klein Licensing segment. Royalty, advertising and other revenues from Calvin Klein’s two largest business partners accounted for approximately 55% of its royalty, advertising and other revenues in 2006. We also derive licensing revenues from our Van Heusen, IZOD, IZOD G, G.H. Bass & Co. and Arrow brand names, as well as from the sublicensing of Geoffrey Beene, BCBG Max Azria, BCBG Attitude and Donald J. Trump Signature Collection. Our three largest licensing partners accounted for approximately 34% of royalty, advertising and other revenues for these brand names as a group in 2006. The operating profit associated with our royalty, advertising and other revenues is significant because the operating expenses directly associated with administering and 
monitoring an individual licensing or similar agreement are minimal. Therefore, the loss of a significant business partner, whether due to the termination or expiration of the relationship, the cessation of the business partner’s operations or otherwise (including as a result of financial difficulties of the partner), without an equivalent replacement, could materially affect our profitability.

While we generally have significant control over our business partners’ products and advertising, we rely on our business partners for, among other things, operational and financial controls over their businesses. Our business partners’ failure to successfully market licensed products or our inability to replace our existing business partners could materially and adversely affect our revenues both directly from reduced royalty and other revenues received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products. Risks are also associated with a business partner’s ability to:

·
obtain capital;

·
execute its business plans, including timely delivery of quality products;

·
manage its labor relations;

·
maintain relationships with its suppliers;

·
manage its credit risk effectively; and

·
maintain relationships with its customers.

In addition, we rely on our business partners to preserve the value of our brands. Although we make every attempt to protect our brands through, among other things, approval rights over design, production quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of our products, we cannot assure you that we can control the use by our business partners of each of our licensed brands. The misuse of our brands by a business partner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, Calvin Klein in the past has been involved in legal proceedings with Warnaco with respect to certain quality and distribution issues. As a result of our acquisition of Calvin Klein in 2003, Warnaco is entitled to control design and advertising related to the sale of underwear, intimate apparel and sleepwear products bearing the Calvin Klein brands, although to date, it has only ex
ercised this right with respect to design. We cannot assure you that Warnaco will continue to maintain the same standards of design and, if it assumes control, advertising previously maintained by Calvin Klein, although we believe they are generally obligated to do so.

Our retail stores are heavily dependent on the ability and desire of consumers to travel and shop.

Our retail stores are located principally in outlet malls, which are typically located in or near vacation destinations or away from large population centers where department stores and other traditional retailers are concentrated. As a result, fuel shortages, increased fuel prices, travel restrictions, travel concerns and other circumstances, including as a result of war, terrorist attacks or the perceived threat of war or terrorist attacks, which would lead to decreased travel, could have a material adverse affect on us. Other factors which could affect the success of our stores include:

·
the location of the mall or the location of a particular store within the mall;

·
the other tenants occupying space at the mall;

·
increased competition in areas where the outlet malls are located;



22



·
a downturn in the economy generally or in a particular area where an outlet mall is located; and

·
the amount of advertising and promotional dollars spent on attracting consumers to the malls.

We may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights.

Our trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to our success and our competitive position. We are susceptible to others imitating our products and infringing on our intellectual property rights. Since our acquisition of Calvin Klein, we are more susceptible to infringement of our intellectual property rights, as the Calvin Klein brands enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition, and the generally higher pricing of Calvin Klein branded products creates additional incentive for counterfeiters and infringers. Imitation or counterfeiting of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brands or otherwise adversely affect our revenues. We cannot assure you that the actions we have taken to establish and protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights will be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from 
seeking to invalidate our trademarks or block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others. In addition, we cannot assure you that others will not assert rights in, or ownership of, trademarks and other intellectual property rights of ours or in marks that are similar to ours or marks that we license and/or market or that we will be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction. In some cases, there may be trademark owners who have prior rights to our marks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. In other cases, there may be holders who have prior rights to similar marks. For example, we were involved in a proceeding relating to a company’s claim of prior rights to the IZOD mark in Mexico, and Calvin Klein was involved in a proceeding relating to a company’s claim of prior rights to the Calvin Klein 
mark in Chile. We are currently involved in opposition and cancellation proceedings with respect to marks similar to some of our brands, both domestically and internationally.

Our success is dependent on the strategies and reputation of our licensors.

Our business strategy is to offer our products on a multiple brand, multiple channel and multiple price point basis. This strategy is designed to provide stability should market trends shift. As part of this strategy we license the names and brands of recognized designers and celebrities, including Kenneth Cole, Max Azria, Sean “Diddy” Combs (Sean John), Donald J. Trump, Michael Kors, Joseph Abboud, Donna Karan (DKNY), Tommy Hilfiger and Ike Behar. In entering into these license agreements, we plan our products to be targeted towards certain market segments based on consumer demographics, design, suggested pricing and channel of distribution in order to minimize competition between our own products and maximize profitability. If any of our licensors determines to “reposition” a brand we license from them, introduce similar products under similar brand names or otherwise change the parameters of design, pric
ing, distribution, target market or competitive set, we could experience a significant downturn in that brand’s business, adversely affecting our sales and profitability. In addition, as products may be personally associated with these designers and celebrities, our sales of those products could be materially and adversely affected if any of those individual’s images, reputations or popularity were to be negatively impacted.

Our revenues and profits are cyclical and sensitive to general economic conditions, consumer confidence and spending patterns.

The apparel industry has historically been subject to substantial cyclical variations and is particularly affected by adverse trends in the general economy, with consumer spending tending to decline during recessionary periods. The success of our operations depends on consumer spending. Consumer spending is impacted by a number of factors, including actual and perceived economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income (such as unemployment, wages and salaries), business conditions, interest rates, availability of credit and tax rates in the general economy and in the international, regional and local markets where our products are sold. Any significant deterioration in general economic conditions or increases in interest rates could reduce the level of consumer spending and inhibit consumers’ use of credit. In addition, war, terrorist activity or the threat of war and terrorist activity could adversely affect consumer spending,
 and thereby have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

We face intense competition in the apparel industry.

Competition is strong in the apparel industry. We compete with numerous domestic and foreign designers, brands, manufacturers and retailers of apparel, accessories and footwear, some of which are significantly larger or more diversified or have greater resources than we do. In addition, through their use of private label programs, we compete directly with our wholesale customers. We compete within the apparel industry primarily on the basis of:



23



·
anticipating and responding to changing consumer tastes and demands in a timely manner and developing attractive, quality products;

·
maintaining favorable brand recognition;

·
appropriately pricing products and creating an acceptable value proposition for customers;

·
providing strong and effective marketing support;

·
ensuring product availability and optimizing supply chain efficiencies with third party manufacturers and retailers; and

·
obtaining sufficient retail floor space and effective presentation of our products at retail.

The failure to compete effectively or to keep pace with rapidly changing markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we misjudge the market for our products, we could be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities with others.

The loss of members of our executive management and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business.

We depend on the services and management experience of our executive officers who have substantial experience and expertise in our business. We also depend on other key employees involved in our licensing, design and advertising operations. Competition for qualified personnel in the apparel industry is intense, and competitors may use aggressive tactics to recruit our key employees. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could materially adversely affect us.

Acquisitions may not be successful in achieving intended benefits and synergies.

One component of our growth strategy contemplates our making select acquisitions if appropriate opportunities arise. Prior to completing any acquisition, our management team identifies expected synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities. However, these benefits may not be realized due to, among other things:

·
delays or difficulties in completing the integration of acquired companies or assets;

·
higher than expected costs or a need to allocate resources to manage unexpected operating difficulties;

·
diversion of the attention and resources of management;

·
consumers’ failure to accept product offerings by us or our licensees;

·
inability to retain key employees in acquired companies; and

·
assumption of liabilities unrecognized in due diligence.

We cannot assure you that any acquisition will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and our by-laws and Delaware General Corporate Law could make it more difficult to acquire us and may reduce the market price of our common stock.

Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain certain provisions, including provisions requiring supermajority voting (80% of the outstanding voting power) to approve certain business combinations with beneficial owners of 5% or more of our outstanding stock entitled to vote for election of directors, permitting the board of directors to fill vacancies on the board and authorizing the board of directors to issue additional shares of preferred stock without approval of our stockholders. These provisions could also have the effect of deterring changes of control.

In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our common stock. The existence of this provision may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by the board of directors.
