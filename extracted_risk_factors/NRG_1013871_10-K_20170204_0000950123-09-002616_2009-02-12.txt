    Risk
    Factors Related to NRG Energy, Inc.





 



    Many
    of NRG’s power generation facilities operate, wholly or
    partially, without long-term power sale
    agreements.


 


    Many of NRG’s facilities operate as “merchant”
    facilities without long-term power sales agreements for some or
    all of their generating capacity and output, and therefore are
    exposed to market fluctuations. Without the benefit of long-term
    power sales agreements for these assets, NRG cannot be sure that
    it will be able to sell any or all of the power generated by
    these facilities at commercially attractive rates or that these
    facilities will be able to operate profitably. This could lead
    to future impairments of the Company’s property, plant and
    equipment or to the closing of certain of its facilities,
    resulting in economic losses and liabilities, which could have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s results of
    operations, financial condition or cash flows.


 



    NRG’s
    financial performance may be impacted by changing natural gas
    prices, significant and unpredictable price fluctuations in the
    wholesale power markets and other market factors that are beyond
    the Company’s control.


 


    A significant percentage of the Company’s domestic revenues
    are derived from baseload power plants that are fueled by coal.
    In many of the competitive markets where NRG operates, the price
    of power typically is set by natural gas-fired power plants that
    currently have substantially higher variable costs than
    NRG’s coal-fired baseload power plants. This allows the
    Company’s baseload coal generation assets to earn
    attractive operating margins compared to plants fueled by
    natural gas. A decrease in natural gas prices could result in a
    corresponding decrease in the market price of power that could
    significantly reduce the operating margins of the Company’s
    baseload generation assets and materially and adversely impact
    its financial performance.


 


    In addition, because changes in power prices in the markets
    where NRG operates are generally correlated with changes in
    natural gas prices, NRG’s hedging portfolio includes
    natural gas derivative instruments to hedge power prices for its
    baseload generation. If this correlation between power prices
    and natural gas prices is not maintained and a change in gas
    prices is not proportionately offset by a change in power
    prices, the Company’s natural gas hedges may not fully
    cover this differential. This could have a material adverse
    impact on the Company’s cash flow and financial position.


 


    Market prices for power, capacity and ancillary services tend to
    fluctuate substantially. Unlike most other commodities, electric
    power can only be stored on a very limited basis and generally
    must be produced concurrently with its use. As a result, power
    prices are subject to significant volatility from supply and
    demand imbalances, especially in the day-ahead and spot markets.
    Long- and short-term power prices may also fluctuate
    substantially due to other factors outside of the Company’s
    control, including:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    changes in generation capacity in the Company’s markets,
    including the addition of new supplies of power from existing
    competitors or new market entrants as a result of the
    development of new generation plants, expansion of existing
    plants or additional transmission capacity;




 



     
        • 

    
    electric supply disruptions, including plant outages and
    transmission disruptions;




 



     
        • 

    
    changes in power transmission infrastructure;




 



     
        • 

    
    fuel transportation capacity constraints;




 



     
        • 

    
    weather conditions;




 



     
        • 

    
    changes in the demand for power or in patterns of power usage,
    including the potential development of demand-side management
    tools and practices;




 



     
        • 

    
    development of new fuels and new technologies for the production
    of power;




 



     
        • 

    
    regulations and actions of the ISOs; and




 



     
        • 

    
    federal and state power market and environmental regulation and
    legislation.

    These factors have caused the Company’s operating results
    to fluctuate in the past and will continue to cause them to do
    so in the future.


 



    NRG’s
    costs, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows
    could be adversely impacted by disruption of its fuel
    supplies.


 


    NRG relies on coal, oil and natural gas to fuel a majority of
    its power generation facilities. Delivery of these fuels to the
    facilities is dependent upon the continuing financial viability
    of contractual counterparties as well as upon the infrastructure
    (including rail lines, rail cars, barge facilities, roadways,
    and natural gas pipelines) available to serve each generation
    facility. As a result, the Company is subject to the risks of
    disruptions or curtailments in the production of power at its
    generation facilities if a counterparty fails to perform or if
    there is a disruption in the fuel delivery infrastructure.


 


    NRG has sold forward a substantial portion of its baseload power
    in order to lock in long-term prices that it deemed to be
    favorable at the time it entered into the forward sale
    contracts. In order to hedge its obligations under these forward
    power sales contracts, the Company has entered into long-term
    and short-term contracts for the purchase and delivery of fuel.
    Many of the forward power sales contracts do not allow the
    Company to pass through changes in fuel costs or discharge the
    power sale obligations in the case of a disruption in fuel
    supply due to force majeure events or the default of a fuel
    supplier or transporter. Disruptions in the Company’s fuel
    supplies may therefore require it to find alternative fuel
    sources at higher costs, to find other sources of power to
    deliver to counterparties at a higher cost, or to pay damages to
    counterparties for failure to deliver power as contracted. Any
    such event could have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s financial performance.


 


    NRG also buys significant quantities of fuel on a short-term or
    spot market basis. Prices for all of the Company’s fuels
    fluctuate, sometimes rising or falling significantly over a
    relatively short period of time. The price NRG can obtain for
    the sale of energy may not rise at the same rate, or may not
    rise at all, to match a rise in fuel or delivery costs. This may
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
    performance. Changes in market prices for natural gas, coal and
    oil may result from the following:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    weather conditions;




 



     
        • 

    
    seasonality;




 



     
        • 

    
    demand for energy commodities and general economic conditions;




 



     
        • 

    
    disruption or other constraints or inefficiencies of
    electricity, gas or coal transmission or transportation;




 



     
        • 

    
    additional generating capacity;




 



     
        • 

    
    availability and levels of storage and inventory for fuel stocks;




 



     
        • 

    
    natural gas, crude oil, refined products and coal production
    levels;




 



     
        • 

    
    changes in market liquidity;




 



     
        • 

    
    federal, state and foreign governmental regulation and
    legislation; and




 



     
        • 

    
    the creditworthiness and liquidity and willingness of fuel
    suppliers/transporters to do business with the Company.





 


    NRG’s plant operating characteristics and equipment,
    particularly at its coal-fired plants, often dictate the
    specific fuel quality to be combusted. The availability and
    price of specific fuel qualities may vary due to supplier
    financial or operational disruptions, transportation disruptions
    and force majeure. At times, coal of specific quality may not be
    available at any price, or the Company may not be able to
    transport such coal to its facilities on a timely basis. In this
    case, the Company may not be able to run the coal facility even
    if it would be profitable. Operating a coal facility with
    different quality coal can lead to emission or operating
    problems. If the Company had sold forward the power from such a
    coal facility, it could be required to supply or purchase power
    from alternate sources, perhaps at a loss. This could have a
    material adverse impact on the financial results of specific
    plants and on the Company’s results of operations.

    There
    may be periods when NRG will not be able to meet its commitments
    under forward sale obligations at a reasonable cost or at
    all.


 


    A substantial portion of the output from NRG’s baseload
    facilities has been sold forward under fixed price power sales
    contracts through 2014, and the Company also sells forward the
    output from its intermediate and peaking facilities when its
    deems it commercially advantageous to do so. Because the
    obligations under most of these agreements are not contingent on
    a unit being available to generate power, NRG is generally
    required to deliver power to the buyer, even in the event of a
    plant outage, fuel supply disruption or a reduction in the
    available capacity of the unit. To the extent that the Company
    does not have sufficient lower cost capacity to meet its
    commitments under its forward sale obligations, the Company
    would be required to supply replacement power either by running
    its other, higher cost power plants or by obtaining power from
    third-party sources at market prices that could substantially
    exceed the contract price. If NRG fails to deliver the
    contracted power, it would be required to pay the difference
    between the market price at the delivery point and the contract
    price, and the amount of such payments could be substantial.


 


    In the South Central region, NRG has long-term contracts with
    rural cooperatives that require it to serve all of the
    cooperatives’ requirements at prices that generally reflect
    the costs of coal-fired generation. At times, the output from
    NRG’s coal-fired Big Cajun II facility has been and
    will continue to be inadequate to serve these obligations, and
    when that happens the Company has typically purchased power from
    other power producers, often at a loss. NRG’s financial
    returns from its South Central region could deteriorate over
    time if the rural cooperatives significantly grow their customer
    base during the remaining terms of these contracts unless the
    Company is able to amend or renegotiate its contracts with the
    cooperatives or add generating capacity.


 



    NRG’s
    trading operations and the use of hedging agreements could
    result in financial losses that negatively impact its results of
    operations.


 


    The Company typically enters into hedging agreements, including
    contracts to purchase or sell commodities at future dates and at
    fixed prices, in order to manage the commodity price risks
    inherent in its power generation operations. These activities,
    although intended to mitigate price volatility, expose the
    Company to other risks. When the Company sells power forward, it
    gives up the opportunity to sell power at higher prices in the
    future, which not only may result in lost opportunity costs but
    also may require the Company to post significant amounts of cash
    collateral or other credit support to its counterparties. The
    Company also relies on counterparty performance under its
    hedging agreements and is exposed to the credit quality of its
    counterparties under those agreements. Further, if the values of
    the financial contracts change in a manner that the Company does
    not anticipate, or if a counterparty fails to perform under a
    contract, it could harm the Company’s business, operating
    results or financial position.


 


    NRG does not typically hedge the entire exposure of its
    operations against commodity price volatility. To the extent it
    does not hedge against commodity price volatility, the
    Company’s results of operations and financial position may
    be improved or diminished based upon movement in commodity
    prices.


 


    NRG may engage in trading activities, including the trading of
    power, fuel and emissions allowances that are not directly
    related to the operation of the Company’s generation
    facilities or the management of related risks. These trading
    activities take place in volatile markets and some of these
    trades could be characterized as speculative. The Company would
    expect to settle these trades financially rather than through
    the production of power or the delivery of fuel. This trading
    activity may expose the Company to the risk of significant
    financial losses which could have a material adverse effect on
    its business and financial condition.


 



    NRG
    may not have sufficient liquidity to hedge market risks
    effectively.


 


    The Company is exposed to market risks through its power
    marketing business, which involves the sale of energy, capacity
    and related products and the purchase and sale of fuel,
    transmission services and emission allowances. These market
    risks include, among other risks, volatility arising from
    location and timing differences that may be associated with
    buying and transporting fuel, converting fuel into energy and
    delivering the energy to a buyer.



    
    46



Table of Contents




    NRG undertakes these marketing activities through agreements
    with various counterparties. Many of the Company’s
    agreements with counterparties include provisions that require
    the Company to provide guarantees, offset of netting
    arrangements, letters of credit, a first or second lien on
    assets
    and/or cash
    collateral to protect the counterparties against the risk of the
    Company’s default or insolvency. The amount of such credit
    support that must be provided typically is based on the
    difference between the price of the commodity in a given
    contract and the market price of the commodity. Significant
    movements in market prices can result in the Company being
    required to provide cash collateral and letters of credit in
    very large amounts. The effectiveness of the Company’s
    strategy may be dependent on the amount of collateral available
    to enter into or maintain these contracts, and liquidity
    requirements may be greater than the Company anticipates or will
    be able to meet. Without a sufficient amount of working capital
    to post as collateral in support of performance guarantees or as
    a cash margin, the Company may not be able to manage price
    volatility effectively or to implement its strategy. An increase
    in the amount of letters of credit or cash collateral required
    to be provided to the Company’s counterparties may
    negatively affect the Company’s liquidity and financial
    condition.


 


    Further, if any of NRG’s facilities experience unplanned
    outages, the Company may be required to procure replacement
    power at spot market prices in order to fulfill contractual
    commitments. Without adequate liquidity to meet margin and
    collateral requirements, the Company may be exposed to
    significant losses, may miss significant opportunities, and may
    have increased exposure to the volatility of spot markets.


 



    The
    accounting for NRG’s hedging activities may increase the
    volatility in the Company’s quarterly and annual financial
    results.


 


    NRG engages in commodity-related marketing and price-risk
    management activities in order to financially hedge its exposure
    to market risk with respect to electricity sales from its
    generation assets, fuel utilized by those assets and emission
    allowances.


 


    NRG generally attempts to balance its fixed-price physical and
    financial purchases and sales commitments in terms of contract
    volumes and the timing of performance and delivery obligations
    through the use of financial and physical derivative contracts.
    These derivatives are accounted for in accordance with
    SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
    Hedging Activities, as amended, or SFAS 133, which
    requires the Company to record all derivatives on the balance
    sheet at fair value with changes in the fair value resulting
    from fluctuations in the underlying commodity prices immediately
    recognized in earnings, unless the derivative qualifies for cash
    flow hedge accounting treatment. Whether a derivative qualifies
    for cash flow hedge accounting treatment depends upon it meeting
    specific criteria used to determine if the cash flow hedge is
    and will remain appropriate for the term of the derivative. All
    economic hedges may not necessarily qualify for cash flow hedge
    accounting treatment. As a result, the Company’s quarterly
    and annual results are subject to significant fluctuations
    caused by changes in market prices.


 



    Competition
    in wholesale power markets may have a material adverse effect on
    NRG’s results of operations, cash flows and the market
    value of its assets.


 


    NRG has numerous competitors in all aspects of its business, and
    additional competitors may enter the industry. Because many of
    the Company’s facilities are old, newer plants owned by the
    Company’s competitors are often more efficient than
    NRG’s aging plants, which may put some of these plants at a
    competitive disadvantage to the extent the Company’s
    competitors are able to consume the same or less fuel as the
    Company’s plants consume. Over time, the Company’s
    plants may be squeezed out of their markets, or may be unable to
    compete with these more efficient plants.


 


    In NRG’s power marketing and commercial operations, it
    competes on the basis of its relative skills, financial position
    and access to capital with other providers of electric energy in
    the procurement of fuel and transportation services, and the
    sale of capacity, energy and related products. In order to
    compete successfully, the Company seeks to aggregate fuel
    supplies at competitive prices from different sources and
    locations and to efficiently utilize transportation services
    from third-party pipelines, railways and other fuel transporters
    and transmission services from electric utilities.


 


    Other companies with which NRG competes with may have greater
    liquidity, greater access to credit and other financial
    resources, lower cost structures, more effective risk management
    policies and procedures, greater ability



    
    47



Table of Contents




    to incur losses, longer-standing relationships with customers,
    greater potential for profitability from ancillary services or
    greater flexibility in the timing of their sale of generation
    capacity and ancillary services than NRG does.


 


    NRG’s competitors may be able to respond more quickly to
    new laws or regulations or emerging technologies, or to devote
    greater resources to the construction, expansion or
    refurbishment of their power generation facilities than NRG can.
    In addition, current and potential competitors may make
    strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships
    among themselves or with third parties. Accordingly, it is
    possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new
    competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market
    share. There can be no assurance that NRG will be able to
    compete successfully against current and future competitors, and
    any failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s business, financial condition, results of
    operations and cash flow.


 



    Operation
    of power generation facilities involves significant risks and
    hazards customary to the power industry that could have a
    material adverse effect on NRG’s revenues and results of
    operations. NRG may not have adequate insurance to cover these
    risks and hazards.


 


    The ongoing operation of NRG’s facilities involves risks
    that include the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes,
    performance below expected levels of output or efficiency and
    the inability to transport the Company’s product to its
    customers in an efficient manner due to a lack of transmission
    capacity. Unplanned outages of generating units, including
    extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or
    other problems occur from time to time and are an inherent risk
    of the Company’s business. Unplanned outages typically
    increase the Company’s operation and maintenance expenses
    and may reduce the Company’s revenues as a result of
    selling fewer MWh or require NRG to incur significant costs as a
    result of running one of its higher cost units or obtaining
    replacement power from third parties in the open market to
    satisfy the Company’s forward power sales obligations.
    NRG’s inability to operate the Company’s plants
    efficiently, manage capital expenditures and costs, and generate
    earnings and cash flow from the Company’s asset-based
    businesses could have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s results of operations, financial condition or
    cash flows. While NRG maintains insurance, obtains warranties
    from vendors and obligates contractors to meet certain
    performance levels, the proceeds of such insurance, warranties
    or performance guarantees may not be adequate to cover the
    Company’s lost revenues, increased expenses or liquidated
    damages payments should the Company experience equipment
    breakdown or non-performance by contractors or vendors.


 


    Power generation involves hazardous activities, including
    acquiring, transporting and unloading fuel, operating large
    pieces of rotating equipment and delivering electricity to
    transmission and distribution systems. In addition to natural
    risks such as earthquake, flood, lightning, hurricane and wind,
    other hazards, such as fire, explosion, structural collapse and
    machinery failure are inherent risks in the Company’s
    operations. These and other hazards can cause significant
    personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and
    destruction of property, plant and equipment, contamination of,
    or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. The
    occurrence of any one of these events may result in NRG being
    named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for
    substantial damages, including for environmental cleanup costs,
    personal injury and property damage and fines
    and/or
    penalties. NRG maintains an amount of insurance protection that
    it considers adequate, but the Company cannot provide any
    assurance that its insurance will be sufficient or effective
    under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities
    to which it may be subject. A successful claim for which the
    Company is not fully insured could hurt its financial results
    and materially harm NRG’s financial condition. Further, due
    to rising insurance costs and changes in the insurance markets,
    NRG cannot provide any assurance that its insurance coverage
    will continue to be available at all or at rates or on terms
    similar to those presently available. Any losses not covered by
    insurance could have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s financial condition, results of operations or
    cash flows.


 



    Maintenance,
    expansion and refurbishment of power generation facilities
    involve significant risks that could result in unplanned power
    outages or reduced output and could have a material adverse
    effect on NRG’s results of operations, cash flow and
    financial condition.


 


    Many of NRG’s facilities are old and require periodic
    upgrading and improvement. Any unexpected failure, including
    failure associated with breakdowns, forced outages or any
    unanticipated capital expenditures could result in reduced
    profitability.



    
    48



Table of Contents




    NRG cannot be certain of the level of capital expenditures that
    will be required due to changing environmental and safety laws
    and regulations (including changes in the interpretation or
    enforcement thereof), needed facility repairs and unexpected
    events (such as natural disasters or terrorist attacks). The
    unexpected requirement of large capital expenditures could have
    a material adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity and
    financial condition.


 


    If NRG makes any major modifications to its power generation
    facilities, the Company may be required to install the best
    available control technology or to achieve the lowest achievable
    emission rates as such terms are defined under the new source
    review provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. Any such
    modifications would likely result in substantial additional
    capital expenditures.


 



    The
    Company may incur additional costs or delays in the construction
    and operation of new plants, improvements to existing plants, or
    the implementation of environmental control equipment at
    existing plants and may not be able to recover their investment
    or complete the project.


 


    The Company is in the process of constructing new generation
    facilities, improving its existing facilities and adding
    environmental controls to its existing facilities. The
    construction, expansion, modification and refurbishment of power
    generation facilities involve many additional risks, including:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    delays in obtaining necessary permits and licenses;




 



     
        • 

    
    environmental remediation of soil or groundwater at contaminated
    sites;




 



     
        • 

    
    interruptions to dispatch at the Company’s facilities;




 



     
        • 

    
    supply interruptions;




 



     
        • 

    
    work stoppages;




 



     
        • 

    
    labor disputes;




 



     
        • 

    
    weather interferences;




 



     
        • 

    
    unforeseen engineering, environmental and geological problems;




 



     
        • 

    
    unanticipated cost overruns;




 



     
        • 

    
    exchange rate risks; and




 



     
        • 

    
    performance risks.





 


    Any of these risks could cause NRG’s financial returns on
    new investments to be lower than expected, or could cause the
    Company to operate below expected capacity or availability
    levels, which could result in lost revenues, increased expenses,
    higher maintenance costs and penalties. Insurance is maintained
    to protect against these risks, warranties are generally
    obtained for limited periods relating to the construction of
    each project and its equipment in varying degrees, and
    contractors and equipment suppliers are obligated to meet
    certain performance levels. The insurance, warranties or
    performance guarantees, however, may not be adequate to cover
    increased expenses. As a result, a project may cost more than
    projected and may be unable to fund principal and interest
    payments under its construction financing obligations, if any. A
    default under such a financing obligation could result in losing
    the Company’s interest in a power generation facility.


 


    If the Company is unable to complete the development or
    construction of a facility or environmental control, or decides
    to delay or cancel such project, it may not be able to recover
    its investment in that facility or environmental control.
    Furthermore, if construction projects are not completed
    according to specification, the Company may incur liabilities
    and suffer reduced plant efficiency, higher operating costs and
    reduced net income.


 



    The
    Company’s RepoweringNRG program is subject to financing
    risks that could adversely impact NRG’s financial
    performance.


 


    While NRG currently intends to develop and finance the more
    capital intensive, solid fuel-fired projects included in the
    RepoweringNRG program on a non-recourse or limited
    recourse basis through separate project financed entities, and
    intends to seek additional investments in most of these projects
    from third parties, NRG



    
    49



Table of Contents




    anticipates that it will need to make significant equity
    investments in these projects. NRG may also decide to develop
    and finance some of the projects, such as smaller gas-fired and
    renewable projects, using corporate financial resources rather
    than non-recourse debt, which could subject NRG to significant
    capital expenditure requirements and to risks inherent in the
    development and construction of new generation facilities. In
    addition to providing some or all of the equity required to
    develop and build the proposed projects, NRG’s ability to
    finance these projects on a non-recourse basis is contingent
    upon a number of factors, including the terms of the EPC
    contracts, construction costs, PPAs and fuel procurement
    contracts, capital markets conditions, the availability of tax
    credits and other government incentives for certain new
    technologies. To the extent NRG is not able to obtain
    non-recourse financing for any project or should the credit
    rating agencies attribute a material amount of the project
    finance debt to NRG’s credit, the financing of the
    RepoweringNRG projects could have a negative impact on
    the credit ratings of NRG.


 


    As part of the RepoweringNRG program, NRG may also choose
    to undertake the repowering, refurbishment or upgrade of current
    facilities based on the Company’s assessment that such
    activity will provide adequate financial returns. Such projects
    often require several years of development and capital
    expenditures before commencement of commercial operations, and
    key assumptions underpinning a decision to make such an
    investment may prove incorrect, including assumptions regarding
    construction costs, timing, available financing and future fuel
    and power prices.


 



    Supplier
    and/or customer concentration at certain of NRG’s
    facilities may expose the Company to significant financial
    credit or performance risks.


 


    NRG often relies on a single contracted supplier or a small
    number of suppliers for the provision of fuel, transportation of
    fuel and other services required for the operation of certain of
    its facilities. If these suppliers cannot perform, the Company
    utilizes the marketplace to provide these services. There can be
    no assurance that the marketplace can provide these services as,
    when and where required.


 


    At times, NRG relies on a single customer or a few customers to
    purchase all or a significant portion of a facility’s
    output, in some cases under long-term agreements that account
    for a substantial percentage of the anticipated revenue from a
    given facility. The Company has also hedged a portion of its
    exposure to power price fluctuations through forward fixed price
    power sales and natural gas price swap agreements.
    Counterparties to these agreements may breach or may be unable
    to perform their obligations. NRG may not be able to enter into
    replacement agreements on terms as favorable as its existing
    agreements, or at all. If the Company was unable to enter into
    replacement PPA’s, the Company would sell its plants’
    power at market prices. If the Company is unable to enter into
    replacement fuel or fuel transportation purchase agreements, NRG
    would seek to purchase the Company’s fuel requirements at
    market prices, exposing the Company to market price volatility
    and the risk that fuel and transportation may not be available
    during certain periods at any price.


 


    The failure of any supplier or customer to fulfill its
    contractual obligations to NRG could have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s financial results. Consequently,
    the financial performance of the Company’s facilities is
    dependent on the credit quality of, and continued performance
    by, suppliers and customers.


 



    NRG
    relies on power transmission facilities that it does not own or
    control and that are subject to transmission constraints within
    a number of the Company’s core regions. If these facilities
    fail to provide NRG with adequate transmission capacity, the
    Company may be restricted in its ability to deliver wholesale
    electric power to its customers and the Company may either incur
    additional costs or forego revenues. Conversely, improvements to
    certain transmission systems could also reduce
    revenues.


 


    NRG depends on transmission facilities owned and operated by
    others to deliver the wholesale power it sells from the
    Company’s power generation plants to its customers. If
    transmission is disrupted, or if the transmission capacity
    infrastructure is inadequate, NRG’s ability to sell and
    deliver wholesale power may be adversely impacted. If a
    region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate,
    the Company’s recovery of wholesale costs and profits may
    be limited. If restrictive transmission price regulation is
    imposed, the transmission companies may not have sufficient
    incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure.
    The Company cannot also predict whether transmission facilities
    will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive
    access to those markets.



    
    50

    In addition, in certain of the markets in which NRG operates,
    energy transmission congestion may occur and the Company may be
    deemed responsible for congestion costs if it schedules delivery
    of power between congestion zones during times when congestion
    occurs between the zones. If NRG were liable for such congestion
    costs, the Company’s financial results could be adversely
    affected.


 


    In the CAISO, NYISO and NE-ISO markets, the Company has a
    significant amount of generation located in load pockets, making
    that generation valuable, particularly with respect to
    maintaining the reliability of the transmission grid. Expansion
    of transmission systems to reduce or eliminate these load
    pockets could negatively impact the value or profitability of
    our existing facilities in these areas.


 



    Because
    NRG owns less than a majority of some of its project
    investments, the Company cannot exercise complete control over
    their operations.


 


    NRG has limited control over the operation of some project
    investments and joint ventures because the Company’s
    investments are in projects where it beneficially owns less than
    a majority of the ownership interests. NRG seeks to exert a
    degree of influence with respect to the management and operation
    of projects in which it owns less than a majority of the
    ownership interests by negotiating to obtain positions on
    management committees or to receive certain limited governance
    rights, such as rights to veto significant actions. However, the
    Company may not always succeed in such negotiations. NRG may be
    dependent on its co-venturers to operate such projects. The
    Company’s co-venturers may not have the level of
    experience, technical expertise, human resources management and
    other attributes necessary to operate these projects optimally.
    The approval of co-venturers also may be required for NRG to
    receive distributions of funds from projects or to transfer the
    Company’s interest in projects.


 



    Future
    acquisition activities may have adverse effects.


 


    NRG may seek to acquire additional companies or assets in the
    Company’s industry. The acquisition of power generation
    companies and assets is subject to substantial risks, including
    the failure to identify material problems during due diligence,
    the risk of over-paying for assets and the inability to arrange
    financing for an acquisition as may be required or desired.
    Further, the integration and consolidation of acquisitions
    requires substantial human, financial and other resources and,
    ultimately, the Company’s acquisitions may not be
    successfully integrated. There can be no assurances that any
    future acquisitions will perform as expected or that the returns
    from such acquisitions will support the indebtedness incurred to
    acquire them or the capital expenditures needed to develop them.


 



    NRG’s
    business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and
    may be adversely affected by legislative or regulatory changes,
    as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply
    with, existing or future regulations or
    requirements.


 


    NRG’s business is subject to extensive foreign, and US
    federal, state and local laws and regulation. Compliance with
    the requirements under these various regulatory regimes may
    cause the Company to incur significant additional costs, and
    failure to comply with such requirements could result in the
    shutdown of the non-complying facility, the imposition of liens,
    fines,
    and/or civil
    or criminal liability.


 


    Public utilities under the FPA are required to obtain FERC
    acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of
    electricity. All of NRG’s non-qualifying facility
    generating companies and power marketing affiliates in the US
    make sales of electricity in interstate commerce and are public
    utilities for purposes of the FPA. The FERC has granted each of
    NRG’s generating and power marketing companies the
    authority to sell electricity at market-based rates. The
    FERC’s orders that grant NRG’s generating and power
    marketing companies market-based rate authority reserve the
    right to revoke or revise that authority if the FERC
    subsequently determines that NRG can exercise market power in
    transmission or generation, create barriers to entry, or engage
    in abusive affiliate transactions. In addition, NRG’s
    market-based sales are subject to certain market behavior rules,
    and if any of NRG’s generating and power marketing
    companies were deemed to have violated one of those rules, they
    are subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with
    the violation
    and/or
    suspension or revocation of their market-based rate authority.
    If NRG’s generating and power marketing companies were to
    lose their market-based rate authority, such companies would be
    required to obtain the FERC’s acceptance of a
    cost-of-service rate schedule and could become



    
    51



Table of Contents




    subject to the accounting, record-keeping, and reporting
    requirements that are imposed on utilities with cost-based rate
    schedules. This could have an adverse effect on the rates NRG
    charges for power from its facilities.


 


    NRG is also affected by legislative and regulatory changes, as
    well as changes to market design, market rules, tariffs, cost
    allocations, and bidding rules that occur in the existing ISOs.
    The ISOs that oversee most of the wholesale power markets
    impose, and in the future may continue to impose, mitigation,
    including price limitations, offer caps, and other mechanisms to
    address some of the volatility and the potential exercise of
    market power in these markets. These types of price limitations
    and other regulatory mechanisms may have an adverse effect on
    the profitability of NRG’s generation facilities that sell
    energy and capacity into the wholesale power markets.


 


    The regulatory environment applicable to the electric power
    industry has undergone substantial changes over the past several
    years as a result of restructuring initiatives at both the state
    and federal levels. These changes are ongoing and the Company
    cannot predict the future design of the wholesale power markets
    or the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment
    will have on NRG’s business. In addition, in some of these
    markets, interested parties have proposed material market design
    changes, including the elimination of a single clearing price
    mechanism, as well as proposals to re-regulate the markets or
    require divestiture by generating companies to reduce their
    market share. Other proposals to re-regulate may be made and
    legislative or other attention to the electric power market
    restructuring process may delay or reverse the deregulation
    process. If competitive restructuring of the electric power
    markets is reversed, discontinued, or delayed, our business
    prospects and financial results could be negatively impacted.


 



    NRG’s
    ownership interest in a nuclear power facility subjects the
    Company to regulations, costs and liabilities uniquely
    associated with these types of facilities.


 


    Under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, or AEA,
    operation of STP, of which NRG indirectly owns a 44.0% interest,
    is subject to regulation by the NRC. Such regulation includes
    licensing, inspection, enforcement, testing, evaluation and
    modification of all aspects of nuclear reactor power plant
    design and operation, environmental and safety performance,
    technical and financial qualifications, decommissioning funding
    assurance and transfer and foreign ownership restrictions.
    NRG’s 44% share of the output of STP represents
    approximately 1,175 MW of generation capacity.


 


    There are unique risks to owning and operating a nuclear power
    facility. These include liabilities related to the handling,
    treatment, storage, disposal, transport, release and use of
    radioactive materials, particularly with respect to spent
    nuclear fuel, and uncertainties regarding the ultimate, and
    potential exposure to, technical and financial risks associated
    with modifying or decommissioning a nuclear facility. The NRC
    could require the shutdown of the plant for safety reasons or
    refuse to permit restart of the unit after unplanned or planned
    outages. New or amended NRC safety and regulatory requirements
    may give rise to additional operation and maintenance costs and
    capital expenditures. STP may be obligated to continue storing
    spent nuclear fuel if the Department of Energy continues to fail
    to meet its contractual obligations to STP made pursuant to the
    US Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to accept and dispose of
    STP’s spent nuclear fuel. See also “Environmental
    Matters — US Federal Environmental
    Initiatives — Nuclear Waste” in Item 1
    for further discussion. Costs associated with these risks could
    be substantial and have a material adverse effect on NRG’s
    results of operations, financial condition or cash flow. In
    addition, to the extent that all or a part of STP is required by
    the NRC to permanently or temporarily shut down or modify its
    operations, or is otherwise subject to a forced outage, NRG may
    incur additional costs to the extent it is obligated to provide
    power from more expensive alternative sources — either
    NRG’s own plants, third party generators or the
    ERCOT — to cover the Company’s then existing
    forward sale obligations. Such shutdown or modification could
    also lead to substantial costs related to the storage and
    disposal of radioactive materials and spent nuclear fuel.


 


    NRG and the other owners of STP maintain nuclear property and
    nuclear liability insurance coverage as required by law. The
    Price-Anderson Act, as amended by the Energy Policy Act of 2005,
    requires owners of nuclear power plants in the US to be
    collectively responsible for retrospective secondary insurance
    premiums for liability to the public arising from nuclear
    incidents resulting in claims in excess of the required primary
    insurance coverage amount of $300 million per reactor. The
    Price-Anderson Act only covers nuclear liability associated with
    any accident in the course of operation of the nuclear reactor,
    transportation of nuclear fuel to the reactor site, in the
    storage of nuclear fuel and waste at the reactor site and the
    transportation of the spent nuclear fuel and nuclear waste



    
    52



Table of Contents




    from the nuclear reactor. All other non-nuclear liabilities are
    not covered. Any substantial retrospective premiums imposed
    under the Price-Anderson Act or losses not covered by insurance
    could have a material adverse effect on NRG’s financial
    condition, results of operations or cash flows.


 



    NRG is
    subject to environmental laws and regulations that impose
    extensive and increasingly stringent requirements on the
    Company’s ongoing operations, as well as potentially
    substantial liabilities arising out of environmental
    contamination. These environmental requirements and liabilities
    could adversely impact NRG’s results of operations,
    financial condition and cash flows.


 


    NRG’s business is subject to the environmental laws and
    regulations of foreign, federal, state and local authorities.
    The Company must comply with numerous environmental laws and
    regulations and obtain numerous governmental permits and
    approvals to operate the Company’s plants. Should NRG fail
    to comply with any environmental requirements that apply to its
    operations, the Company could be subject to administrative,
    civil and/or
    criminal liability and fines, and regulatory agencies could take
    other actions seeking to curtail the Company’s operations.
    In addition, when new requirements take effect or when existing
    environmental requirements are revised, reinterpreted or subject
    to changing enforcement policies, NRG’s business, results
    of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be
    adversely affected.


 


    Environmental laws and regulations have generally become more
    stringent over time, and the Company expects this trend to
    continue. Regulations currently under revision by USEPA,
    including CAIR, MACT, standards to control Mercury and the 316
    (b) rule to mitigate impact by once through cooling, could
    result in tighter standards or reduced compliance flexibility.
    While the NRG fleet employs advanced controls and utilizes
    industry’s best practices, new regulations to address
    tightened National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone and
    PM 2.5 or new rules to further restrict ash handling at
    coal-fired power plants could also further restrict plant
    operations.


 


    Furthermore, certain environmental laws impose strict, joint and
    several liability for costs required to clean up and restore
    sites where hazardous substances have been disposed or otherwise
    released. The Company is generally responsible for all
    liabilities associated with the environmental condition of its
    power generation plants, including any soil or groundwater
    contamination that may be present, regardless of when the
    liabilities arose and whether the liabilities are known or
    unknown, or arose from the activities of predecessors or third
    parties.


 



    Policies
    at the national, regional and state levels to regulate GHG
    emissions could adversely impact NRG’s result of
    operations, financial condition and cash flows.


 


    At the national level and at various regional and state levels,
    policies are under development to regulate GHG emissions,
    thereby effectively putting a cost on such emissions in order to
    create financial incentive to reduce them. In addition the EPA
    is giving consideration to control of
    CO2
    emissions from power plants via existing sections of the CAA.
    Since power plants, particularly coal-fired plants, are a
    significant source of GHG emissions both in the US and globally,
    it is almost certain that GHG regulatory actions will encompass
    power plants as well as other GHG emitting stationary sources.
    In 2008, in the course of producing approximately
    80 million MWh of electricity, NRG’s power plants
    emitted 68 million tonnes of
    CO2,
    of which 61 million tonnes were emitted in the US,
    4 million tonnes in Germany and 3 million tonnes in
    Australia.


 


    Federal, state or regional regulation of GHG emissions could
    have a material impact on the Company’s financial
    performance. The actual impact on the Company’s financial
    performance will depend on a number of factors, including the
    overall level of GHG reductions required under any such
    regulations, the price and availability of offsets, and the
    extent to which NRG would be entitled to receive
    CO2
    emissions allowances without having to purchase them in an
    auction or on the open market.


 


    Of the approximately 61 million tonnes of
    CO2
    emitted by NRG in the US in 2008, approximately 12 million
    tonnes were emitted from the Company’s generating units in
    Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, and New York
    that are subject to RGGI starting in 2009. The impact of RGGI on
    power prices (and thus on the Company’s financial
    performance), indirectly through generators seeking to pass
    through the cost of their
    CO2
    emissions, cannot be predicted. However, NRG believes that due
    to the absence of
    CO2
    allowance allocations under RGGI, the direct financial impact on
    NRG is likely to be negative as the Company will incur costs in
    the course of securing the necessary allowances and offsets at
    auction and in the market.

Table of Contents





    NRG’s
    business, financial condition and results of operations could be
    adversely impacted by strikes or work stoppages by its unionized
    employees or inability to replace employees as they
    retire.


 


    As of December 31, 2008, approximately 66% of NRG’s
    employees at its US generation plants were covered by collective
    bargaining agreements. In the event that the Company’s
    union employees strike, participate in a work stoppage or
    slowdown or engage in other forms of labor strife or disruption,
    NRG would be responsible for procuring replacement labor or the
    Company could experience reduced power generation or outages.
    NRG’s ability to procure such labor is uncertain. Strikes,
    work stoppages or the inability to negotiate future collective
    bargaining agreements on favorable terms could have a material
    adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial
    condition, results of operations and cash flow. In addition, a
    number of our employees at our plants are close to retirement.
    Our inability to replace those workers could create potential
    knowledge and expertise gaps as those workers retire.


 



    Changes
    in technology may impair the value of NRG’s power
    plants.


 


    Research and development activities are ongoing to provide
    alternative and more efficient technologies to produce power,
    including fuel cells, “clean” coal and coal
    gasification, micro-turbines, photovoltaic (solar) cells and
    improvements in traditional technologies and equipment, such as
    more efficient gas turbines. Advances in these or other
    technologies could reduce the costs of power production to a
    level below what the Company has currently forecasted, which
    could adversely affect its cash flow, results of operations or
    competitive position.


 



    Acts
    of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on NRG’s
    financial condition, results of operations and cash
    flows.


 


    NRG’s generation facilities and the facilities of third
    parties on which they rely may be targets of terrorist
    activities, as well as events occurring in response to or in
    connection with them, that could cause environmental
    repercussions
    and/or
    result in full or partial disruption of the facilities ability
    to generate, transmit, transport or distribute electricity or
    natural gas. Strategic targets, such as energy-related
    facilities, may be at greater risk of future terrorist
    activities than other domestic targets. Any such environmental
    repercussions or disruption could result in a significant
    decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction or
    remediation costs, which could have a material adverse effect on
    the Company’s financial condition, results of operations
    and cash flow.


 



    NRG’s
    international investments are subject to additional risks that
    its US investments do not have.


 


    NRG has investments in power projects in Australia and Germany.
    International investments are subject to risks and uncertainties
    relating to the political, social and economic structures of the
    countries in which it invests. The likelihood of such
    occurrences and their overall effect upon NRG may vary greatly
    from country to country and are not predictable. Risks
    specifically related to our investments in international
    projects may include:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    fluctuations in currency valuation;




 



     
        • 

    
    currency inconvertibility;




 



     
        • 

    
    expropriation and confiscatory taxation;




 



     
        • 

    
    restrictions on the repatriation of capital; and




 



     
        • 

    
    approval requirements and governmental policies limiting returns
    to foreign investors.





 



    NRG’s
    level of indebtedness could adversely affect its ability to
    raise additional capital to fund its operations, or return
    capital to stockholders. It could also expose it to the risk of
    increased interest rates and limit its ability to react to
    changes in the economy or its industry.


 


    NRG’s substantial debt could have important consequences,
    including:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    increasing NRG’s vulnerability to general economic and
    industry conditions;




 



     
        • 

    
    requiring a substantial portion of NRG’s cash flow from
    operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and
    interest on its indebtedness, therefore reducing NRG’s
    ability to pay dividends to holders of its






    
    54



Table of Contents






    
    
    



     
    

    
    preferred or common stock or to use its cash flow to fund its
    operations, capital expenditures and future business
    opportunities;





 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    limiting NRG’s ability to enter into long-term power sales
    or fuel purchases which require credit support;




 



     
        • 

    
    exposing NRG to the risk of increased interest rates because
    certain of its borrowings, including borrowings under its new
    senior secured credit facility are at variable rates of interest;




 



     
        • 

    
    limiting NRG’s ability to obtain additional financing for
    working capital including collateral postings, capital
    expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and
    general corporate or other purposes; and




 



     
        • 

    
    limiting NRG’s ability to adjust to changing market
    conditions and placing it at a competitive disadvantage compared
    to its competitors who have less debt.





 


    The indentures for NRG’s notes and senior secured credit
    facility contain financial and other restrictive covenants that
    may limit the Company’s ability to return capital to
    stockholders or otherwise engage in activities that may be in
    its long-term best interests. NRG’s failure to comply with
    those covenants could result in an event of default which, if
    not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of
    the Company’s indebtedness.


 


    In addition, NRG’s ability to arrange financing, either at
    the corporate level or at a non-recourse project-level
    subsidiary, and the costs of such capital, are dependent on
    numerous factors, including:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    general economic and capital market conditions;




 



     
        • 

    
    credit availability from banks and other financial institutions;




 



     
        • 

    
    investor confidence in NRG, its partners and the regional
    wholesale power markets;




 



     
        • 

    
    NRG’s financial performance and the financial performance
    of its subsidiaries;




 



     
        • 

    
    NRG’s level of indebtedness and compliance with covenants
    in debt agreements;




 



     
        • 

    
    maintenance of acceptable credit ratings;




 



     
        • 

    
    cash flow; and




 



     
        • 

    
    provisions of tax and securities laws that may impact raising
    capital.





 


    NRG may not be successful in obtaining additional capital for
    these or other reasons. The failure to obtain additional capital
    from time to time may have a material adverse effect on its
    business and operations.


 



    Goodwill
    and/or other intangible assets not subject to amortization that
    NRG has recorded in connection with its acquisitions are subject
    to mandatory annual impairment evaluations and as a result, the
    Company could be required to write off some or all of this
    goodwill and other intangible assets, which may adversely affect
    the Company’s financial condition and results of
    operations.


 


    In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or
    FASB, Accounting Standard Number 142, Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets, or SFAS 142, goodwill is not
    amortized but is reviewed annually or more frequently for
    impairment and other intangibles are also reviewed at least
    annually or more frequently, if certain conditions exist, and
    may be amortized. Any reduction in or impairment of the value of
    goodwill or other intangible assets will result in a charge
    against earnings which could materially adversely affect
    NRG’s reported results of operations and financial position
    in future periods.


 



    Exelon
    Corporation’s unsolicited acquisition proposal and tender
    offer for all the Company’s outstanding common stock is
    disruptive to the Company’s management and business and
    creates uncertainty that may adversely affect our
    business.


 


    On October 19, 2008, the Company received an unsolicited
    proposal from Exelon Corporation to acquire all of the
    outstanding shares of the Company and on November 12, 2008,
    Exelon announced a tender offer, referred to as the Exelon
    tender offer, for all of the Company’s outstanding common
    stock. NRG’s Board of Directors, after carefully reviewing
    the proposal, unanimously concluded that the proposal was not in
    the best interests of the

    stockholders and has recommended that NRG stockholders not
    tender their shares. On January 30, 2009 Exelon also
    announced a proposed slate of nine nominees for election to
    NRG’s Board of Directors at the 2009 Annual Meeting of
    Stockholders, together with a proposal to increase the number of
    NRG directors from 12 to 19 with two vacancies, referred to as
    the Exelon proxy contest. The review and consideration of the
    Exelon tender offer and proxy contest, have been, and may
    continue to be, a significant distraction for our management and
    employees and have required, and may continue to require, the
    expenditure of significant time and resources by the Company.
    Exelon’s tender offer and proxy contest have also created
    uncertainty for the Company’s employees and this
    uncertainty may adversely affect the Company’s ability to
    retain key employees and to hire new talent. Exelon’s
    tender offer and proxy contest may also create uncertainty for
    current and potential business partners, which may cause them to
    terminate, or not to renew or enter into, arrangements with the
    Company. In addition, if the Exelon nominees are elected to
    NRG’s Board of Directors, the ability of management to work
    effectively and efficiently with NRG’s Board of Directors
    with respect to the day to day operations and development of the
    Company may be restricted, and as a result, may harm the
    Company’s business. Furthermore, the Company and its Board
    of Directors are defendants in three purported stockholder class
    action complaints relating to the Exelon proposal as more fully
    described in Part I, Item 3 “Legal
    Proceedings” of this Annual Report on
    Form 10-K.
    These lawsuits or any future similar or related lawsuits may
    become time consuming and expensive. These consequences, alone
    or in combination, may harm the Company’s business.


 



    Exelon
    Corporation’s proxy contest, board expansion and director
    nominations could result in a Change of Control, as that term is
    used in the Company’s Senior Credit Facility and Senior
    Notes, which may adversely affect our business.


 


    A default under the Company’s Senior Credit Facility and a
    mandatory change in control offer under the Senior Notes may be
    triggered if the Exelon nominees compose a majority of
    NRG’s Board of Directors at any time. A Change of Control
    under the Company’s Senior Credit Facility and Senior Notes
    could occur if the two vacancies on NRG’s Board of
    Directors (created only if the Company’s shareholders
    approve Exelon’s proposal to the expand NRG’s Board of
    Directors to 19 members) are not filled by directors
    nominated by the current NRG Board. A Change of Control may also
    be triggered by other future events where the resulting
    composition of NRG’s Board of Directors consists of a
    majority of Exelon nominated directors, such as the retirement
    or death of any non-Exelon nominated Board member. If a Change
    of Control is triggered under the Senior Credit Facility and
    Senior Notes this could have a material and significant impact
    on the Company’s business.
