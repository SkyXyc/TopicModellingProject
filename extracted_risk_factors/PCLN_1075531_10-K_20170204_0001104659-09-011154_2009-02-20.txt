PART I

 

Item 1.  Business

 

General

 

We are a
leading global online travel company that offers our customers a broad range of
travel services, including hotel rooms, car rentals, airline tickets, vacation
packages, cruises and destination services. 
Internationally, we offer our customers hotel room reservations in over
75 countries and 27 languages. In the United States, we offer our customers a
unique choice: the ability to purchase travel services in a traditional,
price-disclosed manner or the opportunity to use our unique Name Your Own Price® service, which allows our customers to make
offers for travel services at discounted prices.

 

We launched
our business in the United States in 1998 under the priceline.com brand and
have since expanded our operations to include, among others, the brands
Booking.com, Active Hotels and Agoda. 
Our principal goal is to be the leading worldwide online hotel
reservation service.  At present, we
derive substantially all of our revenues from the following sources:

 

·                              Transaction
revenues from our Name Your Own Price® hotel room, rental car and airline ticket
services, as well as our vacation packages service;

 

·                              Commissions
earned from the sale of price-disclosed hotel rooms, rental cars, cruises and
other travel services;

 

·                              Customer
processing fees charged in connection with the sale of both Name Your Own Price® and price-disclosed hotel rooms and Name Your Own Price® airline tickets and rental car services.  We eliminated processing fees for our
price-disclosed airline ticket service in June 2007;

 

·                              Transaction
revenue from our price-disclosed “merchant” hotel room service;

 

·                              Global
distribution system (“GDS”) reservation booking fees related to both our Name Your Own Price® airline ticket, hotel room and rental car
services, and price-disclosed airline tickets and rental car services; and

 

·                              Other
revenues derived primarily from selling advertising on our websites.

For the year
ended December 31, 2008, we had revenues of approximately $1.9 billion
comprised of “merchant” revenue, “agency” revenue and “other” revenue.  Merchant revenues are derived from transactions where we are the
merchant of record and, among other things, select suppliers and determine the
price we will accept from the customer. 
Merchant revenues, which represented the substantial majority of our total
revenues in 2008, consisted of: (1) transaction
revenues representing the selling price of Name
Your Own Price® hotel
rooms, rental cars and airline tickets and price-disclosed vacation packages
services; (2) transaction revenues representing the amount charged to a
customer, less the amount charged by suppliers in connection with the hotel
rooms provided through our merchant price-disclosed hotel service;
(3) customer processing fees charged in connection with the sale of both Name Your Own Price® and price-disclosed
hotel rooms and Name Your Own Price® airline tickets and rental car services; and
(4) ancillary fees, including GDS reservation booking fees related to
certain of the services listed above. 
Agency revenues are generally derived from travel related transactions
where we are not the merchant of record and where the prices of our services
are determined by third parties. Agency revenues consisted primarily of:
(1) travel commissions and (2) GDS reservation booking fees related
to certain of the services listed above. 
Other revenues are derived
primarily from advertising on our websites.

 

Priceline.com
was formed as a Delaware limited liability company in 1997 and was converted
into a Delaware corporation in July 1998. 
Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the
symbol “PCLN.”  Our principal executive
offices are located at 800 Connecticut Avenue, Norwalk, Connecticut 06854.

 

The priceline.com Business
Model

 

We offer customers the ability to make hotel reservations on a worldwide
basis primarily under the Booking.com and Agoda brands internationally and
primarily under the priceline.com brand in the United States.  In the United States, we also offer customers
the ability to purchase other travel services, including airline tickets,
rental car days, vacations packages, destination services and cruises, through
both a traditional, price-disclosed “retail” manner, and through our
proprietary demand-collection system known as Name Your Own Price®.  These services are made
available over the Internet through websites that we own or control, and are
provided by major travel suppliers, including more than 70,000 hotel properties
worldwide.  We believe that the
combination of our retail price-disclosed model and our Name Your Own Price® model allows us to provide a
broad array of options to value-conscious travelers, while providing us with
diverse streams of revenue.

 

International: Price-Disclosed Hotel Services.  We
offer a retail, price-disclosed hotel service in Europe and Asia through our
international operations, which consist primarily of Booking.com B.V., one of Europe’s leading Internet hotel reservation
services, with more than twenty offices worldwide, Booking.com Limited,
a Cambridge, England-based Internet hotel reservation distributor (together with Booking.com B.V.,
“Booking.com”), and priceline.com Mauritius Company Limited (formerly
known as the Agoda Company, Ltd.), an
Internet hotel distributor with operations in Singapore and Thailand
(“Agoda”).  We work with over 60,000
chain-owned and independently owned hotels offering hotel reservations on
various websites and in multiple languages.  For geographic related
information, see Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

 

Our
international business — the significant majority of which is currently
generated by our European operations — represented approximately 58.4% of our gross bookings (an operating and
statistical metric referring to the total dollar value, inclusive of all taxes
and fees, of all travel services purchased by our customers) in the year ended
December 31, 2008, and contributed more than two-thirds of our
consolidated operating income during that period.  Given that our international business is
primarily comprised of hotel reservation services, revenue earned in connection
with the reservation of hotel room nights has come to represent the substantial
majority of our gross profit.

United States: Retail Travel Services.  In
the United States, we offer customers the ability to purchase price-disclosed
hotel rooms, rental car days, airline tickets, vacation packages, destination
services and cruises at retail prices. 
In these transactions, the customer typically selects airline flights,
hotel reservations, rental car or other travel itineraries from an array of
results produced in response to the customer’s request.  These results include the identity of the
travel supplier, the exact price
of the itinerary, and other details relating to the itineraries.  In some circumstances, the customer pays us
at the time of reservation, and in other circumstances, the customer pays the
travel supplier directly at the time of travel.

 

United States: Name Your Own Price® Travel Services.  We have developed a unique pricing system
known as a “demand collection system” that uses the information sharing and
communications power of the Internet to create a different way of pricing
services.  We believe our services have
created a balance between the interests of buyers, who are willing to accept
trade-offs in order to save money, and sellers, who are prepared to generate
incremental revenue by selling their services at below retail prices, provided
that they can do so without disrupting their existing distribution channels or
retail pricing structures.  Our demand
collection system allows consumers to specify the price they are prepared to
pay when submitting an offer for a particular leisure travel service.  We then access databases in which
participating suppliers file secure discounted rates not generally available to
the public, to determine whether we can fulfill the customer’s offer and decide
whether we want to accept the offer at the price designated by the
consumer.  For most of these
transactions, we have discretion in supplier selection and are the merchant of
record in the transaction.  Consumers
agree to hold their offers open for a specified period of time to enable us to
determine whether we can or want to accept the offer.  Once fulfilled, offers generally cannot be
canceled — thereby making such purchases generally non-refundable.  This system uses the flexibility of buyers to
enable sellers to accept a lower price in order to sell their excess
capacity.  We believe that our demand
collection system addresses limitations inherent in traditional seller-driven
pricing mechanisms in a manner that offers substantial benefits to both buyers
and sellers.  We believe that the
principal advantages of our system include the following:

 

·                  Cost Savings.  Our Name
Your Own Price® demand collection
system allows consumers to save money in a simple and compelling way.  Buyers effectively trade off flexibility
about brands, service features and/or sellers in return for prices that are
generally lower than those that can be obtained at that time through
traditional retail distribution channels.

 

·                  Incremental Revenue for Sellers.  Sellers use our Name Your Own Price® demand collection system as a revenue
management tool to generate incremental revenue without disrupting their
existing distribution channels or retail pricing structures.  We require consumers to be flexible with
respect to brands and service features. 
As a result, our Name Your Own Price® system does not reveal sellers’ brands to
customers prior to the consummation of a transaction, thereby protecting their
brand integrity.  This shielding of brand
identity and price enables sellers to sell services at discounted prices
without cannibalizing their own retail sales by publicly announcing discount
prices and without competing against their own distributors.

 

·                  Proprietary Seller Networks.  We have assembled proprietary networks of
industry leading sellers that represent high quality brands.  By establishing attractive networks of seller
participants with reputations for quality, scale and national presence, we
believe that we foster increased participation by both buyers and sellers.

 

We often refer to services offered through our Name Your Own Price® service as “opaque” services because all
aspects of the travel service are not visible to the consumer before making an
offer.

The priceline.com Strategy

 

The
online travel category has continued to experience significant worldwide growth
as consumer purchasing shifts from traditional off-line channels to interactive
online channels.  Priceline.com has been
a leader in the hotel reservation market internationally and in the deep
discount segment of this market in the United States.  Our strategy is to continue to participate
broadly in online travel growth by expanding our service offerings and markets.

 

·                  Become the Leading Worldwide
Online Hotel Reservation Service.  The size of the travel market
outside of the United States is substantially greater than that within the
United States.  Historically, Internet
penetration rates and e-commerce adoption rates of international consumers have
trailed those of the United States. 
However, international consumers are rapidly moving to online means for
purchasing travel.  Accordingly, recent
international online travel growth rates have substantially exceeded, and are
expected to continue to exceed, the growth rates within the United States.  Prior to 2004, substantially all of our
revenues were generated within the United States.  For the year ended December 31, 2008,
our international business — the significant majority of which is currently
generated by Booking.com — represented approximately 58.4% of our gross
bookings, and contributed more than two-thirds of our consolidated operating
income during that period.  We expect
that our international operations will represent a growing percentage of our
total gross bookings and operating income (before taking into account the
offsetting impacts of foreign exchange, if any) over the long term.  Because of what we believe to be superior
growth rate opportunities associated with international online travel, we
intend to continue to invest resources to increase the share of our revenues
represented by international consumers and capitalize on international travel
demand.

 

We
believe that the positioning of our Booking.com hotel reservation service gives
us a foothold into a broader international market.  We intend to use Agoda, the online hotel
distributor with operations in Singapore and Thailand, which we acquired in
2007, to further develop our operations throughout Asia, where Internet
penetration and e-commerce adoption are growing at a substantially greater pace
than in the United States over the last several years.  We have begun, and intend to continue,
development of the means to share hotel availability among our brands, which we
believe will allow us to monetize demand across international markets.  In addition, from time to time we explore
strategic transactions and acquisitions that, among other things, allow us to
provide our services to new markets.  We
believe that by promoting our brands worldwide, sharing hotel supply and
customer flow and applying our industry experiences in the United States and
Europe to other international regions, we can further expand our service
internationally and become the leading worldwide online hotel reservation
service.

 

·                  Continue to be One of the
Top Online Travel Businesses in North America for Value-Conscious Leisure
Travelers.  Our Name
Your Own Price® demand collection system in the
United States allows consumers to save money in a simple and compelling
way.  Buyers effectively trade off
flexibility about brands, service features and/or sellers in return for prices
that are lower than those that can be obtained at that time through traditional
retail distribution channels.  We have
expended significant resources to allow us to introduce price-disclosed retail
services in the United States to our consumers to compliment the Name Your Own Price® service. 
We believe that by offering a “one-stop-shopping” solution to our
customers, we can simultaneously fulfill the needs of those customers who are
prepared to accept the unique restrictions of our Name Your Own Price® service in exchange for receiving significant
savings relative to retail prices, as well as those customers who are less
price sensitive and require the certainty of knowing the full details of their
travel itinerary prior to purchasing.  In
June 2007, we eliminated booking fees on price-disclosed retail

Table of Contents

 

airline
tickets as part of our strategy to provide value to our customers, and in 2008,
we reduced price-disclosed hotel booking fees and eliminated hotel change fees.

 

We
intend to enhance our service offerings continually, particularly our retail
offerings, by adding competitive functionality, adding competitive content at
competitive pricing, adding and improving the content and merchandising on our
website as well as “cross-sell” opportunities (for example, offering a hotel
customer the opportunity to add a rental car reservation to the transaction) to
maximize customer conversion.

 

·                  Competitive functionality: We continue to expend significant resources
to remain competitive in terms of the features and functionality we offer our
customers.  For example, since launching
our domestic retail air service, we added the ability to search for flexible
dates or alternative airports, book one-way and multi-destination itineraries
and easily make modifications to search criteria.  In addition, we offer a personal experience,
where individualized content, such as special deals or favorite hotels, can be
presented based upon preferences set by the customer or a customer’s previous
activity on one of our sites.

 

·                  Competitive selection and
pricing: We believe that
having a wide selection of travel options at competitive pricing is critical to
our success.  For example, we have
eliminated booking fees on price-disclosed retail airline tickets, reduced
price-disclosed hotel booking fees and eliminated hotel change fees.  We have also added JetBlue fares to our
retail price-disclosed airline ticket service and added over 10,000 additional
hotels to our domestic vacation package service. In addition, we have renewed
or entered into new agreements with several of our major airline and hotel
suppliers, which we believe improved our access to a better selection of travel
alternatives and pricing.

 

·                  Content and merchandising: As part of our evolution to a “one-stop-shopping”
website, we have added thousands of pages of content to allow customers to
research destinations and hotel properties before booking a reservation.  We offer property descriptions, maps, images,
and user reviews whereby our customers can benefit from the experiences and
opinions of other customers.  In the
United States, we offer “PriceBreakerssm,”
which is a presentation of selected travel itineraries at discounted prices
that is updated daily.  In 2008, we
introduced Price Drop Alerts, whereby we monitor airfares daily and notify
customers of fare reductions via email. 
We also created a loyalty program that awards our customers for using
www.priceline.com and encourages them to try new priceline.com services.  We intend to continue to improve our content
and merchandising with more comprehensive descriptions, more and higher quality
images, and more user reviews, which we believe will improve conversion of
users shopping on our website.

 

·                  Cross-sell opportunities: We also cross-sell different travel
components to maximize the revenue we generate from each customer in the United
States.  We have developed and
implemented functionality that allows customers to “add-on” travel components
to their selection, both during the shopping experience and at time of
purchase.  For example, customers can add
a rental car reservation to their air or hotel reservation, or a hotel
reservation to their air reservation. 
Customers can also add destination related services such as shuttles,
tours and activities.  Additionally, we
cross-sell opaque services on our retail path and retail services on our opaque
path.  For example, an unsuccessful opaque
air customer may be offered a price-disclosed alternative, while a retail hotel
shopper may be offered the Name Your Own
Price® alternative for greater savings.  In addition, personalized cross-sell offers
can appear on the priceline.com homepage when a customer has an upcoming
trip.  We intend to further enhance these
cross-sell opportunities across all of our services.

We
strive to be the preferred discount distribution channel in the United States
for airlines, hotels and rental car companies. 
Our Name Your Own Price® service protects supplier brand and published
pricing and our packages and other merchandising provide access to the brand
neutral leisure traveler at attractive distribution costs.

 

Service Offerings — International

 

Retail Hotels.  We offer a retail,
price-disclosed hotel service worldwide, primarily through our Booking.com and
Agoda brands.  We work with over 60,000 chain-owned and independently owned hotels
offering hotel reservations on various websites and in 27 languages.  Hotels participate in Booking.com, which
operates under an agency model, and Agoda, which operates primarily under a
merchant model, by filing rates in our proprietary extranet.  Hotels may also participate in Agoda via
consolidator relationships.

 

Service Offerings — United States

 

Name Your Own Price® Hotels.  Through our Name
Your Own Price® hotel room reservation
service, customers can make reservations at hotel properties in substantially
all major cities and metropolitan areas in the United States and Europe.  Most significant national hotel chains as
well as several important real estate investment trusts and independent
property owners participate in our Name Your
Own Price® service. 
Hotels participate by filing secure private discounted rates with
related rules in a global distribution system database.  These specific rates generally are not
available to the general public or to consolidators and other discount
distributors who sell to the public, however, hotel participants may make
similar rates available to consolidators or other discount providers under
other arrangements.

 

To
make an offer, a customer specifies: (1) the city and neighborhood in
which the customer wants to stay, (2) the dates on which the customer
wishes to check in and check out, (3) the “class” of service (1, 2, 2½, 3,
3½, 4, 5-star or “resort”), (3) the price the customer is willing to pay,
and (4) the customer’s valid credit card to guarantee the offer.  When making an offer, consumers must agree to
stay at any one of our participating hotel partners and accept a reservation
that cannot be refunded or changed.  The
target market for our Name Your Own Price® hotel room reservation service is the leisure
travel market.

 

Retail Hotels.  We also operate a price-disclosed hotel
service in the United States that enables our customers to select the exact
hotel they want to book and the price of the reservation is disclosed prior to
purchase.

 

Name Your Own Price® Rental Cars.  Our Name
Your Own Price® rental car service is currently available in
substantially all major United States airport markets.  The top five brand name airport rental car
companies in the United States are seller participants in our rental car
program.  Consumers can access our
website and select where and when they want to rent a car, what kind of car
they want to rent (e.g., economy, compact, mid-size, SUV, etc.) and the price
they want to pay per-day, excluding taxes, fees and surcharges.  When we receive an offer, we determine
whether to fulfill the offer based upon the available rates and rules.  If a customer’s offer is accepted, we will
immediately reserve the rental car, charge the customer’s credit card and
notify the customer of the rental car company and location providing the rental
car.

 

Retail Rental Cars.  We also offer a price-disclosed rental car
service on www.priceline.com that enables our customers in the United
States to choose between price-disclosed or Name
Your Own Price® rental cars.  Our price-disclosed rental car service
operates under the “agency” model, under which we earn a
commission upon rental car return, and accommodates one-way and
off-airport reservations.  As with our
retail airline ticket and hotel reservation services, rental car reservations
booked in a retail

manner do not have the restrictions associated with our Name
Your Own Price® service. 
Customers can select the exact car they want to book and the price of
the reservation is disclosed prior to purchase.

 

With
respect to each of our airline, hotel and rental car services, we believe the
combination of our Name Your Own Price® model and the retail model
allows us to provide a broad array of options to value-conscious travelers,
while providing us with diverse streams of revenue.

 

Name Your Own Price® Airline
Tickets.  There are a total of 10
domestic airlines and 22 international airlines participating in our Name Your Own Price® airline ticket service.

 

Our
Name Your Own Price® airline ticket service operates in a manner
similar to our Name Your Own Price® hotel room reservation service.  To make an offer, a customer specifies: (1) the
origin and destination of the trip, (2) the dates on which the customer
wishes to depart and return, (3) the price the customer is willing to pay,
and (4) the customer’s valid credit card to guarantee the offer.  When making an offer, consumers must agree
to:

 

·                  fly on any one
of our participating airline partners;

 

·                  leave at any
time of day between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. on their desired dates of
departure and return;

 

·                  purchase only
round trip coach class tickets between the same two points of departure and
return;

 

·                  accept at least
one stop or connection;

 

·                  receive no
frequent flier miles or upgrades; and

 

·                  accept tickets
that cannot be refunded or changed.

 

If
a customer’s offer is not accepted, but we believe the offer is reasonably
close to a price that we would be willing to accept, we will attempt to satisfy
the customer by providing guidance to the customer indicating that changing
certain parameters of the offer would increase the chances of the offer being
accepted.  For example, in some cases we
disclose to the customer that agreeing to fly into an alternate airport would
increase the chances of his or her offer being accepted.  In other cases, we inform the customer that
increasing his or her offer by a certain amount would increase the chances of
it being accepted.  We may also offer a
customer the opportunity to purchase a price-disclosed retail airline ticket.

 

Retail Airline Tickets.  We also offer our customers in the United
States the ability to purchase retail airline tickets at disclosed prices and
with disclosed itineraries.  The airline
sets the retail price paid by the consumer and is the merchant of record for
the transaction.  These airline tickets
do not have the restrictions associated with our Name Your
Own Price® service.  For example, in addition to having fully
disclosed itineraries, retail airline tickets are generally changeable and
cancellable for a fee.  In June 2007,
we eliminated booking fees we had previously charged on the sale of published
price retail airline tickets.

 

Vacation Packages.  Our vacation package service allows consumers
in the United States to purchase packages consisting of airfare,
hotel, rental car and destination service components.  Consumers can select the exact hotel or
resort that they want to reserve, and then select either a retail airline
ticket or an opaque airline ticket for the air component of their package.  Additionally, consumers can add destination
related services such as parking, tours, shuttles, and activities.  Vacation packages are sold at disclosed
prices, although consumers cannot determine the exact price of the individual
components on our website.

Destination Services.  We currently offer customers in the United
States the opportunity to purchase destination services such as parking, event
tickets, ground transfers, tours and other services available at their travel
destinations.  This service is offered to
consumers as part of the process of booking an air, hotel and vacation
reservation, and also as a standalone service.

 

Cruises.  We
also offer price-disclosed cruise trips through World Travel Holdings, Inc.,
formerly known as National Leisure Group, Inc. (“WTH”), an agent
representing major cruise lines.  Our
cruise service allows consumers in the United States to search for
and compare cruise pricing and availability information from 19 cruise lines,
and to purchase cruises online or through a call center by selecting from our
published offerings and prices.  We
receive commissions from WTH on successful cruise bookings.

 

Travel Insurance.  We offer our air, hotel, vacation package and
rental car customers in the United States an optional travel insurance
package that provides coverage for, among other things, trip cancellation, trip
interruption, medical expenses, emergency evacuation, and loss of baggage,
property and travel documents.  The
travel insurance is provided by member companies of American International
Group, Inc. (“AIG”).  We receive a
percentage of the premium from AIG member companies for every optional
insurance package purchased by our customers.

 

While
we are currently focused on the travel services described above, over time, we
may evaluate the introduction of other services that we believe could enhance
the travel experience of our customers.

 

Financial Services

 

We offer financial services through Priceline Mortgage Company LLC,
d/b/a pricelinemortgage.com, of which we own 49% and hold two of five seats on
the board of managers.  Pursuant to an intellectual property license from
us, pricelinemortgage.com utilizes the priceline.com Name Your Own Price® business model.  Although results from pricelinemortgage.com
have been impacted by external housing and credit market conditions, our
proportionate share of its losses has not been significant.  Pricelinemortgage.com is controlled by EverBank,
a federally chartered savings association supervised by the Office of Thrift
Supervision, and a wholly owned subsidiary of EverBank Financial Corp. 
Pricelinemortgage.com has access to the management resources and expertise of
EverBank, one of the nation’s largest privately held banking and mortgage
firms. EverBank Financial Corp. provides management services to
pricelinemortgage.com, including the procurement of personnel and office space
and assistance in obtaining regulatory approvals.  Pricelinemortgage.com
is operating in all 50 states.  Robert J. Mylod, our Vice Chairman and
Head of Worldwide Strategy and Planning, is a director of, and an investor in,
EverBank Financial Corp., the parent company of EverBank.  Mr. Mylod’s
investment represents less than 1/10 of one percent of EverBank Financial
Corp.’s outstanding common stock.

 

Under the terms of an agreement with EverBank Financial Corp.,
pricelinemortgage.com allows consumers to access attractive financial services
including, but not limited to, mortgages, home equity loans, and banking
service.  We record our proportionate
share of the results of pricelinemortgage.com as equity in income (loss) of
investees and minority interests.

 

Marketing and Brand
Awareness

 

Booking.com, priceline.com and Agoda have established widely used and
recognized e-commerce brands through aggressive marketing and promotion
campaigns.  During 2008, our total online
advertising expenses were approximately $270.7 million, a substantial portion
of which was spent internationally through Internet search engines and online
affiliate marketing.  We also invested
approximately $38.0 million in priceline.com-branded offline advertising in the
United States.  We intend

 

8












Table
of Contents

 

to continue a marketing strategy to promote brand awareness and the
concept that consumers can save money using our services.  Underlying our marketing strategy is our
belief that our target market is all consumers, not just Internet-savvy
consumers.  We intend to continue to
promote the Booking.com, priceline.com and Agoda brands aggressively throughout
2009.

 

As
our international operations have become more meaningful contributors to our
results, we have seen, and expect to continue to see, changes in our
advertising expense.  Specifically,
because our international operations utilize Internet search engines and online
affiliate marketing, principally through the purchase of travel-related
keywords, as principal means of generating traffic to their websites, our
online advertising expense has increased significantly since our acquisition of
those companies, a trend we expect to continue throughout 2009.

 

Competition

 

We compete with both online and traditional sellers of the services we
offer. The market for the services we offer is intensely competitive, and
current and new competitors can launch new sites at a relatively low cost. In
addition, the major online travel companies with which we compete have
significantly greater financial resources and capital than we do.  We may not be able to effectively compete
with industry conglomerates such as Expedia, Orbitz Worldwide or Sabre, each of
which has access to significantly greater and more diversified resources than
we do.

 

We currently or potentially compete with a variety of companies with
respect to each service we offer. With respect to our travel services, these
competitors include, but are not limited to:

 

·                  Internet travel services such as Expedia, Hotels.com and Hotwire, which are
owned by Expedia, and Venere, an Italian-based agency hotel reservation service
provider that was acquired by Expedia in the third quarter of 2008; Travelocity
and lastminute.com, which are owned by the Sabre Group; Orbitz.com,
Cheaptickets, ebookers, HotelClub and RatesToGo, which are currently owned by
Orbitz Worldwide; laterooms and asiarooms owned by Tui Travel, and Gullivers,
octopustravel, Superbreak, hotel.de, Hotel Reservation Service, Ctrip, Rakuten
and Wotif;

 

·                  travel suppliers such as airlines, hotel companies and rental car
companies, many of which have their own branded websites to which they drive
business;

 

·                  large online portal and search companies, such as AOL (including AOL
Travel), Yahoo! (including Yahoo! Travel) and Google;

 

·                  traditional travel agencies, wholesalers and tour operators;

 

·                  online travel search sites such as Mobissimo.com, FareChase.com, Kayak.com
and SideStep.com (each sometimes referred to as “meta-search” sites) and travel
research sites that have search functionality, such as TripAdvisor, Travelzoo
and Cheapflights.com; and

 

·                  operators of travel industry reservation databases such as Galileo,
Travelport, Amadeus and Sabre.

 

Many airline, hotel and rental
car suppliers, including suppliers with which we conduct business, are focusing
on driving online demand to their own websites in lieu of third-party
distributors such as us.  Certain
suppliers have attempted to charge additional fees to customers who book
airline reservations through an online channel other than their own
website.  Furthermore, several low cost
airlines, which are having increasing success in the marketplace, distribute
their tickets exclusively through their own websites.  Suppliers who sell on their own websites
typically do not charge a processing fee, and, in some

instances, offer advantages such as web-only fares,
bonus miles or loyalty points, which could make their offerings more attractive
to consumers than models like ours.

 

We potentially face
competition from a number of large Internet companies and services that have
expertise in developing online commerce and in facilitating Internet traffic,
including Amazon.com, AOL, MSN, Google.com and Yahoo!, which compete with us
either directly or indirectly through affiliations with other e-commerce or
off-line companies.  We also compete with
“meta-search” companies, which are companies that leverage their search
technology to aggregate travel search results across supplier, travel agent and
other websites.  Some established search
engine companies as well as start-ups are attempting to enter the online travel
marketplace in this manner.  If Google,
Yahoo! or other portals decide to refer significant traffic to travel search
engines, it could result in more competition from supplier websites and higher
customer acquisition costs for third-party sites such as ours.  Competition from these and other sources
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

 

Many of our current and
potential competitors, including Internet directories, search engines and large
traditional retailers, have longer operating histories, larger customer bases,
greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial, marketing,
personnel, technical and other resources than priceline.com. Some of these
competitors may be able to secure services on more favorable terms than we can.
In addition, many of these competitors may be able to devote significantly
greater resources to:

 

·                  marketing and promotional campaigns;

 

·                  attracting traffic to their websites;

 

·                  attracting and retaining key employees;

 

·                  securing vendors and supply; and

 

·                  website and systems development.

 

Increased competition could result in reduced operating margins, loss
of market share and damage to our brand. There can be no assurance that we will
be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. See “Risk Factors — Intense competition could reduce our market share and
harm our financial performance.”

 

Operations and Technology

 

Our business is supported by
a systems platform, which was designed with an emphasis on scalability,
performance and reliability.  The
software platform and architecture are built on server-side Java, C++, ASP and
Perl, and SQL scripts integrated with Oracle and MySQL relational database
systems.  This internal platform was
designed to include open application protocol interfaces that can provide
connectivity to vendors in the industries in which we operate.  These include large global systems, such as
airline and hotel room reservation systems and financial service providers, as
well as individual suppliers, such as individual hotels.  Our Internet servers utilize digital certificates
to help us conduct secure communications and transactions, as appropriate.

 

The systems infrastructure and web and database servers of our
international operations are primarily hosted at Equinix Europe Ltd., in
London, England, and Global Switch Amsterdam B.V. and TelecityRedbus, in the
Netherlands. Each location has backup generators and infrastructure typical of
hosted data centers.

Our systems infrastructure and web and database servers in the U.S. are
hosted at SAVVIS in Jersey City, New Jersey, which provides communication
links, as well as 24-hour monitoring and engineering support.  SAVVIS has its own generator and multiple
back-up systems in Jersey City.  We also
maintain a second web hosting facility at AT&T in New York City.  Our network operations center monitors both
web hosting facilities and is located in our Norwalk, Connecticut
headquarters.  All three facilities have
a continuous power supply system, generators and redundant servers.  If SAVVIS were unable, for any reason, to
support our primary web hosting facility, we would need to activate our
secondary site at AT&T.

 

We out-source most of our domestic call center and customer service
functions, and use a real-time interactive voice response system with transfer
capabilities to our call centers and customer service centers.

 

Intellectual Property

 

We currently hold twenty issued United States patents, Nos. 5,794,207;
5,897,620; 6,085,169; 6,108,639; 6,134,534; 6,240,396; 6,332,129; 6,345,090;
6,356,878; 6,418,415; 6,466,919; 6,484,153; 6,510,418; 6,553,346; 6,993,503;
7,203,660; 7,188,176; 7,333,941; 7,386,508; 7,472,074 and over twenty pending
United States and foreign patent applications. 
All of our issued United States patents expire between September 4,
2016 and March 22, 2025.  We file
additional patent applications on new inventions, as appropriate.

 

While we believe that our issued patents and pending patent
applications help to protect our business, there can be no assurance that:

 

·                  a third party
will not have or obtain one or more patents that can prevent us from practicing
features of our business or that will require us to pay for a license to use
those features;

 

·                  our operations
do not or will not infringe valid, enforceable patents of third parties;

 

·                  any patent can
be successfully defended against challenges by third parties;

 

·                  the pending
patent applications will result in the issuance of patents;

 

·                  competitors or
potential competitors will not devise new methods of competing with us that are
not covered by our patents or patent applications;

 

·                  because of
variations in the application of our business model to each of our services,
our patents will be effective in preventing one or more third parties from
utilizing a copycat business model to offer the same service in one or more
categories;

 

·                  new prior art
will not be discovered that may diminish the value of or invalidate an issued
patent; or

 

·                  legislative or judicial
action will not directly or indirectly affect the scope and validity of any of
our patent rights.

 

There
has been discussion in the press regarding the examination and issuance of
so-called “business method” patents. As a result, the United States Patent and
Trademark Office has intensified the review process applicable to such patent
applications.   Recent court decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court and
the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have made the requirements for
obtaining and maintaining certain types of patent protection more
stringent.   In addition, we understand there to be renewed focus on
legislative reform efforts concerning patents in the U.S. Senate, House of

Representatives
or both.  At this time, we cannot fully
anticipate what effect, if any, the new judicial action and the intensified
Patent Office review process or new legislation will have on our issued
patents and pending patent applications. See, “Risk Factors
— We face risks related to our intellectual property.”

 

We
hold the exclusive rights to the trade names and service marks PRICELINE® and PRICELINE.COMÒ in the U.S.
as well as in many foreign countries.  We own U.S. Service Mark
Registrations Nos. 2,481,750; 2,272,659; 2,594,582 for PRICELINE, and
2,481,752; 2,594,592; and 2,481,112 for PRICELINE.COM, including all attendant
goodwill.  We also own U.S. Service Mark Registration No. 2,647,673
for NAME YOUR OWN PRICE®; U.S. Service
Mark Registration No. 2,481,751 for PRICELINEMORTGAGE®, U.S. Service Mark
Registration No. 3,357,458 for PRICELINE EUROPE, and others. In
addition, through our European subsidiary Booking.com BV, we hold the
registered service mark BOOKINGS in the Netherlands (Benelux Registrations Nos.
762051 and 762054) and in France (French Registration No. 43276223, as
well as French Registration No. 43276225 for BOOKING; two European
Community (“EC”) service mark registrations for BOOKINGS (Registrations Nos.
3413846 and 3413952,) and one for ACTIVE HOTELS (EC Reg. No. 3859618).

 

We
aggressively monitor, protect and enforce our copyrights, service marks,
trademarks, trade dress, domain names and trade secrets on an ongoing basis
through a combination of laws and contractual restrictions, such as
confidentiality agreements.  For example, we endeavor to register our
trademarks and service marks in the United States and internationally,
currently holding over one hundred fifty service mark registrations
worldwide.  However, effective trademark, service mark, copyright and
trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our
services are or may be made available online, regardless of our continuous
efforts to police and register our marks.  See, “Risk Factors —- We face risks related to our
intellectual property.”

 

We
currently own numerous Internet domain names in various top level domains,
particularly for purposes of deterring service mark infringement.  Domain
names are generally regulated by Internet regulatory bodies such as the World
Intellectual Property Organization.  The relationship between trademark
and unfair competition laws and domain name registration is evolving.  The
Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act in the U.S. and the Uniform Domain
Name Dispute Resolution Policy of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names
and Numbers have both significantly enhanced our ability to deter the
infringing incorporation of trademarks into domain names by third parties and
to assert our registrations against them.  We actively pursue significant
infringers as appropriate, including cybersquatters and typosquatters who
misappropriate our service marks and misspellings thereof as domain names for
commercial purposes, in order to maintain our famous marks and prevent the
dilution of their distinctiveness.  See, “Risk
Factors — We face risks related to our intellectual property.”

 

Governmental Regulation

 

The
services we provide are subject to various federal, state and local
regulations. For example, our travel service is subject to laws governing the
offer and/or sale of travel services as well as laws requiring us to register
as a “seller of travel.”  In addition,
our services may be subject to various state and local taxing regulations.  See “Risk Factors — Uncertainty regarding state and local taxes”.

 

We are subject to federal, state and international laws that require
protection of user privacy and user data.  In our processing of travel transactions,
we receive and store a large volume of personally identifiable data, both in
the United States, Europe and Asia.  This
data is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous
jurisdictions around the world, including the Commission of the European Union
through its Data Protection Directive and variations of that directive in the
member states of the European Union. 
Such government action is typically intended to protect the privacy of
personal data that is collected, processed and transmitted in or from the
governing jurisdiction.

 

All
of our services are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws and
regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices.

We
are also subject to regulations applicable to businesses conducting online
commerce.  Presently, there are
relatively few laws specifically directed toward online services. However, due
to the increasing popularity and use of the Internet and online services, it is
possible that laws and regulations will be adopted with respect to the Internet
or online services. These laws and regulations could cover issues such as
online contracts, user privacy, freedom of expression, pricing, fraud, content
and quality of services, taxation, advertising, intellectual property rights
and information security. Applicability to the Internet of existing laws
governing issues such as property ownership, copyrights and other intellectual
property issues, taxation, libel, obscenity and personal privacy is developing,
but any such new legislation could have significant implications on how we
conduct online business. In addition, some states may require us to qualify in
that state to do business as a foreign corporation because our service is
available in that state over the Internet. Although we are qualified to do
business in a number of states, failure to meet the qualifications of certain
states, or a determination that we are required to qualify in additional
states, could subject us to taxes and penalties.  See “Risk Factors — Regulatory and legal uncertainties
could harm our business,” and
“Uncertainty regarding state and local taxes.”

 

Our
European operations are subject to various foreign regulations and governing
bodies that might limit their services. They may be affected by unexpected
changes in regulatory requirements and various tariffs and trade barriers in
connection with online commerce. Any failure by our European operations to
comply may have an adverse effect on our business.

 

Pricelinemortgage.com is
subject to laws governing the licensing and conduct of persons providing
mortgage brokerage services. Such laws typically require certain consumer
protection disclosures and loan solicitation procedures. For example, the Real
Estate Settlement Procedures Act prohibits the payment and receipt of mortgage
loan referral fees, and permits persons to be compensated only for the fair
value of non-referral services. Accordingly, pricelinemortgage.com’s home
financing service provides non-referral services such as website development
and advertising to a licensed mortgage broker who, in turn, provides the
back-end processing for loan referrals.

 

Seasonality

 

Our
Name Your Own Price® services are non-refundable in nature, and
accordingly, we recognize travel revenue at the time a booking is
generated.  However, we recognize revenue
generated from our retail hotel services, including our international
operations, at the time that the customer checks out of the hotel.  As a result, a meaningful amount of retail
hotel bookings generated earlier in the year, as customers plan and reserve
their spring and summer vacations, will not be recognized until future
quarters. From a cost perspective, however, we expense the substantial majority
of our advertising activities as they are incurred, which is typically in the
quarter in which bookings are generated. 
Therefore, as our retail hotel business continues to grow, we expect our
quarterly results to become increasingly impacted by these seasonal factors.

 

Employees

 

As of February 1, 2009,
we employed approximately 1,780 full-time employees, of which 430 are based in
the United States and 1,350 are based in our international offices. We also
retain independent contractors to support our customer service and system
support functions.

 

We
have never had a work stoppage and our employees are not represented by
any collective bargaining unit. We consider our relations with our employees to
be good. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to
attract, integrate, retain and motivate highly qualified technical and
managerial personnel, for whom competition is intense.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

 

The following risk factors and other
information included in this Annual Report should be carefully considered.  The risks and uncertainties described below
are not the only ones we face. 
Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us may also
impair our business operations.  If any
of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results
and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

 

The worldwide
recession has adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our
business.

 

Worldwide recession is negatively
affecting the broad travel market and, as a result, our business.  For example, hotels worldwide have recently
reported significant decreases in occupancy rates and average daily rates
(“ADRs”).  We believe that the positive
trends impacting our domestic and international business overshadowed these
negative influences in 2008.  However,
market conditions worsened significantly recently, with particular
deterioration in the fourth quarter of 2008 and January 2009.  Worldwide recession has weakened the
fundamental demand for our services and could also cause an increase in the
number of customers who cancel existing travel reservations with us.

 

Booking.com currently distributes
hotel rooms primarily through a retail model whereby we earn a commission from
the hotel property when the customer checks out of the hotel.  This requires us to pursue collection of
commissions relating to hotel room reservations from the hotel after the
customer has completed his or her stay. 
As a result of worldwide recession, we have experienced an increase in
delinquency rates, negatively impacting our business.  Bankruptcies or insolvencies of hotel
suppliers could also have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations
and financial condition.

 

We believe the worldwide
recession and these weakening travel market trends, including, without
limitation, decreased consumer demand, further deterioration in ADRs and
increases in cancellations, had a negative impact on our business, particularly
in Europe and Asia, and will continue to have a negative impact in the near
term.  We cannot predict the magnitude or
duration of this worldwide recession, but our current limited visibility does
not suggest any near-term improvement. 
In addition, the worldwide recession has dramatically restricted the
willingness and ability of financial institutions to extend credit.  If we are not able to gain access to funds at
an acceptable cost through the credit market, we may be limited, or unable, to
pursue certain strategic alternatives such as acquisitions and share
repurchases.

Our international operations’
business model exposes us to certain risks that we have not traditionally
experienced in the U.S. hotel business.

 

Throughout 2006, 2007 and
2008, our international operations
experienced significant year-over-year growth in their gross bookings (an
operating and statistical metric referring to the total dollar value, inclusive
of all taxes and fees, of all travel services purchased by our customers).  This growth rate has contributed
significantly to our growth in revenue, gross profit and earnings per
share.  We expect our international operations to experience a
decline in their growth rate in future years as the absolute level of their
gross bookings grows larger.  We expect
other factors to slow the growth rates of our international business, including, for example, worldwide recession, the recent strengthening
of the U.S. dollar versus the Euro, further declines in hotel ADRs, further
increases in cancellations, travel market conditions and the competitiveness of
the market.  A decline in our international operations’ growth rate
could have a negative impact on our future revenue and earnings per share
growth rates and, as a consequence, our stock price.

 

In addition, our international operations rely on various
third party distribution channels to distribute hotel room reservations.  Should one or more of such third parties
cease distribution of our international operations’ reservations, or suffer deterioration in
its search engine ranking, due to changes in search engine algorithms or
otherwise, the business of our international operations could be negatively affected.  Similarly, a significant amount of our international business is directed to our
own websites through advertising campaigns on Internet search engines,
primarily Google, whose pricing and operating dynamics can experience rapid
change both technically and competitively. 
We have experienced increased competition and increased costs associated
with our advertising campaigns.  If a
major search engine changes its pricing, operating or competitive dynamics in a
negative manner, our business, results of operations and financial condition
would be adversely affected.

 

The strategy of our international operations involves rapid
expansion into countries in Europe, including eastern Europe, Asia, North
America and South America and elsewhere, many of which have different customs,
different levels of customer acceptance of the Internet and different
legislation, regulatory environments and tax schemes.  For example, recent civil unrest during the peak booking season in Thailand, a key
market for our Agoda business, negatively impacted booking volumes and future
civil or political unrest would further disrupt Agoda’s business.  In addition,
compliance with foreign legal, regulatory or tax requirements will place
demands on our time and resources, and we may nonetheless experience unforeseen
and potentially adverse legal, regulatory or tax consequences.  If our international operations are
unsuccessful in rapidly expanding into other countries, our business, results
of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.

 

We are dependent on the leisure travel industry and certain travel
suppliers.

 

Our financial prospects are
significantly dependent upon our sale of leisure travel services.  Leisure travel, including the sale of hotel
rooms and leisure airline tickets, is dependent on personal discretionary
spending levels. As a result, sales of leisure travel services tend to decline
during general economic downturns and recessions.  Accordingly, the current worldwide recession
has led to a weakening in the fundamental demand for our services and an
increase in the number of customers who cancel existing travel reservations
with us.  In addition, unforeseen events
beyond our control, such as terrorist attacks, political instability, regional
hostilities, increases in fuel prices, imposition of taxes or surcharges by
regulatory authorities, travel related accidents, travel related health
concerns and unusual weather patterns, including natural disasters such as
hurricanes, tsunamis or earthquakes, also may adversely affect the leisure
travel industry and our business and results of operations. Further, work stoppages or
labor unrest at any of the major airlines could materially adversely affect the
airline industry and, as a consequence, have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

During the year ended December 31,
2008, Name Your Own Price® hotel room nights from our five largest hotel
suppliers accounted for approximately 63.2% of total Name Your Own Price® hotel room
nights sold, and sales of airline tickets from our five largest and two largest
airline suppliers accounted for approximately 75.8% and 37.4% of total airline
tickets sold, respectively. As a result, we are currently substantially
dependent upon the continued participation of these suppliers in our system in
order to maintain and continue to grow our total gross profit.

 

Our arrangements with the
hotel, airline and rental car suppliers that participate in our system — either
Name Your Own Price® or price-disclosed service — generally do not
require them to provide any specific quantity of hotel rooms, airline tickets
or rental cars, or to make rooms, tickets or cars available for any particular
route, in any geographic area or at any particular price.  During the course of our business, we are in
continuous dialogue with our major suppliers about the nature and extent of
their participation in our system. The significant reduction on the part of any
of our major suppliers of their participation in our system for a sustained
period of time or their complete withdrawal could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

 

The
hotel industry has recently experienced a significant decrease in occupancy
rates, and we have experienced slowing demand growth, an increase in
reservation cancellation rates and declining ADRs — trends which have continued
to deteriorate and for which we do not anticipate any near-term improvement.  While lower occupancy rates have historically
resulted in hotel suppliers increasing their distribution of hotel rooms
through third-party intermediaries such as us, our remuneration for hotel
transactions changes proportionately with room price, and therefore, lower ADRs
generally have a negative effect on our hotel business and a negative effect on
our gross profit.

 

We
believe the worldwide recession and
lower ADRs are largely responsible for the increase in the number of hotel
cancellations, particularly at our international operations.  Our international operations distribute hotel rooms primarily through an agency model where
reservations are generally cancellable, as opposed to merchant models operated
by us (principally in the U.S.) and our competition and through which
reservations are generally not cancellable without penalty.  As ADRs decline, customers who have existing
reservations may cancel those reservations and rebook at a lower rate, and in
times of economic stress, travelers are more likely to cancel their vacation
plans outright.  While decreasing ADRs
and a worldwide recession make it relatively more attractive for
consumers to make a cancellable agency reservation than a pre-paid reservation,
our agency business will likely have higher cancellation rates compared to companies who offer predominantly
merchant model hotel rooms.

 

In addition, certain hotels
have begun initiatives to reduce margins received by third party intermediaries
on retail merchant transactions, which is the primary method we employ to
distribute retail hotel room reservations in the United States.  Many hotels distribute rooms through their
own websites and therefore might increase negotiated rates for merchant rate
hotel rooms sold through our merchant price-disclosed hotel service, decreasing
the margin available to us.  While our
merchant price-disclosed hotel agreements with our leading hotel suppliers
provide for specified discounts, if one or more participating hotels were to
require us to limit our merchant margins, upon contract renewal or otherwise,
it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
and financial condition.

 

With respect to our airline
suppliers, the airline industry has experienced a shift in market share from
full-service carriers to low-cost carriers that focus primarily on discount
fares to leisure destinations and we expect this trend to continue.  Some low-cost carriers, such as Southwest,
have not historically distributed their tickets through us or other third-party
intermediaries.  In addition, certain
airlines have significantly limited or eliminated sales of airline tickets
through opaque channels, preferring to consistently show the lowest available
price on their own website.  Certain
airlines have also significantly reduced their domestic capacity, which reduces
the number of airline tickets available to our customers.  Furthermore, we have recently observed a
sharp decline in passenger traffic and airfares across the airline industry,
and we believe the airlines are experiencing significant year-over-year
declines in yield, all of which we believe is principally due to the worldwide
recession.  Decreases in capacity and lower traveler

demand negatively impact our domestic air business, which in turn has
negative repercussions on our domestic hotel and rental car businesses, and
could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

 

We could be adversely
affected by changes in the airline industry, and, in many cases, we will have
no control over such changes or their timing. 
Recently, there has been an emerging prospect of domestic airline
industry consolidation, as evidenced by the recent merger between Delta Air
Lines and Northwest Airlines.  If one of
our major airline suppliers merges or consolidates with, or is acquired by,
another company that either does not participate in the priceline.com system or
that participates on substantially lower levels, the surviving company may
elect not to participate in our system or to participate at lower levels than
the previous supplier.  For example, in September 2005,
US Airways and America West merged.  US
Airways was a meaningful participant in our Name
Your Own Price® system, but America
West participated on a very limited basis. 
The resulting entity participates in our Name Your Own Price® system, but at
much lower levels than US Airways’ historical participation.

 

In addition, in the event
that one of our major suppliers voluntarily or involuntarily declares
bankruptcy and is subsequently unable to successfully emerge from bankruptcy,
and we are unable to replace such supplier, our business would be adversely
affected.  In the past, airline carriers
that have participated in our system and declared bankruptcy have continued to
operate while in bankruptcy.  High oil
prices place financial stress on airline carriers, and increase the risk that a
carrier may cease operations and face liquidation rather than reorganization
under the bankruptcy laws.  For example,
in April 2008, Aloha Airlines and ATA Airlines each ceased operations and
we experienced an increase in credit card charge backs from customers with
tickets on those airlines.  To the extent
major U.S. airlines that participate in our system declare bankruptcy or cease
operations, they may be unable or unwilling to honor tickets sold for their
flights.  Our policy in such event is to
direct customers seeking a refund or exchange to the airline, and not to
provide a remedy ourselves. Because we are the merchant-of-record on sales of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets to our customers, however, we
could experience a significant increase in demands for refunds or credit card
charge backs from customers, which could materially adversely affect our
operations and financial results. In addition, because Name Your Own Price® customers do
not choose their airlines, hotels or rental car companies, the bankruptcy of a
major airline, hotel or rental car company, or even the possibility of such a
bankruptcy, could discourage customers from using our Name Your Own Price® system to book
travel.

 

The loss of any major
airline participant in our Name Your Own
Price® system could result
in other major airlines electing to terminate their participation in the Name Your Own Price® system, which
would further negatively impact our business, results of operations and
financial condition.  In addition, fewer
independent suppliers reduces opacity and competition among suppliers.  In such event, if we are unable to divert
sales to other suppliers, our business, results of operations and financial
condition may be adversely affected.

 

In addition, given the
concentration of the airline industry, particularly in the domestic market, our
competitors could exert pressure on other airlines not to supply us with
tickets. Moreover, the airlines may attempt to establish their own buyer driven
commerce service or participate or invest in other similar services.

 

If
one of our major rental car suppliers merges or consolidates with, or is
acquired by, another company that either does not participate in the
priceline.com system or that participates on substantially lower levels, the
surviving company may elect not to participate in our system or to participate
at lower levels than the previous supplier.  The loss of any rental car
supplier participant in our Name Your Own
Price® system
could result in other rental car suppliers electing to terminate or reduce
their participation in the Name Your Own
Price® system, which would negatively impact our
business, results of operations and financial condition.  Furthermore,
many major rental car companies are highly leveraged and the worldwide
recession creates the potential for severe financial difficulty, including
without limitation, the inability of a rental car company to refinance its
debt, restructure its operations or emerge from a

bankruptcy,
any of which could lead to a reduction in rental car supply made available to
us and an increase in credit card chargebacks. 
In addition, fewer independent suppliers reduces opacity and competition
among suppliers.  In such event, if we are unable to divert sales to other
suppliers, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be
adversely affected.

 

In
addition, rental car companies rely on auto manufacturers to provide new
vehicles for their fleet.  Rental car companies also rely on auto
manufacturers and the wholesale used car market to dispose of their fleets of
cars.  Worldwide recession has led
to questions about the long term viability of the major U.S. auto
manufacturers.  In addition, the tight credit market has negatively
affected the used car market, making it difficult for auto manufacturers and
rental car suppliers to dispose of their fleets.  If the rental car
industry is faced with excess supply, rental car companies may lower retail
rental car rates, which could be beneficial to our retail rental car business,
but detrimental to our Name Your Own Price® business.  Because rental car days are typically less
expensive than airline tickets or hotel room nights, a reduction in retail
rental car rates has a disproportionately adverse effect on sales of Name Your Own Price® rental car days since customers may be less
likely to accept the trade-offs associated with that service.  Alternatively, if the industry is faced with
a shortage of vehicles, rental car companies may reduce the number of car
reservations they distribute through our service or increase the negotiated
rates at which they are willing to provide car reservations.  Any disruption in the supply of vehicles or
the ability to dispose of vehicles by car rental companies could impact their
ability to match their fleet supply with demand, which could adversely impact
our business.

 

We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

 

As a result of the growth
of our international operations, we are conducting a significant portion of our business outside
the United States and are reporting our results in U.S. dollars.  As a result, we face exposure to adverse
movements in currency exchange rates as the financial results of our international operations are translated
from local currency (principally the Euro and the British Pound Sterling) into
U.S. dollars upon consolidation.  For
example, our international
operations contributed approximately $619.8 million to our revenues for the
year ended December 31, 2008, which compares to $372.6 million for the
year ended December 31, 2007. 
Approximately $11.3 million of this increase is due to fluctuations in
currency exchange rates.  The U.S. dollar
generally weakened from when we acquired Booking.com B.V. in July 2005,
until mid-2008, and as a result, the year over year growth rates in our
international results, when reported in U.S. dollars, were positively impacted
by changes in foreign exchange rates. 
However, the U.S. dollar has recently strengthened significantly against
the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, which results in decreased net assets,
revenues, operating expenses, and net income, and in the fourth quarter 2008,
for the first time since our acquisition of Booking.com B.V., the foreign
exchange impact was negative rather than positive.  Accordingly, if this trend continues, it will
become increasingly difficult for us to grow our gross bookings, revenues and
earnings on a U.S. dollar denominated basis during 2009 and beyond.  If the U.S. dollar weakens against the local
currency, the translation of our foreign-currency-denominated balances will
result in increased net assets, gross bookings, revenues, operating expenses,
and net income.

 

Intense competition could reduce our market share and harm our
financial performance.

 

We compete with both online
and traditional sellers of the services we offer. The market for the services
we offer is intensely competitive, and current and new competitors can launch
new sites at a relatively low cost. In addition, the major online travel
companies with which we compete have significantly greater financial resources
and capital than we do.  We may not be
able to effectively compete with industry conglomerates such as Expedia, Orbitz
Worldwide or Sabre, each of which has access to significantly greater and more
diversified resources than we do.

 

18












Table of Contents

 

We currently or potentially
compete with a variety of companies with respect to each service we offer. With
respect to our travel services, these competitors include, but are not limited
to:

 

·                  Internet travel services
such as Expedia, Hotels.com and Hotwire, which are owned by Expedia, and
Venere, an Italian-based agency hotel reservation service provider that was
acquired by Expedia in the third quarter of 2008; Travelocity and
lastminute.com, which are owned by the Sabre Group; Orbitz.com, Cheaptickets,
ebookers, HotelClub and RatesToGo, which are currently owned by Orbitz
Worldwide; laterooms and asiarooms owned by Tui Travel, and Gullivers,
octopustravel, Superbreak, hotel.de, Hotel Reservation Service, Ctrip, Rakuten
and Wotif;

 

·                  travel suppliers such as
airlines, hotel companies and rental car companies, many of which have their
own branded websites to which they drive business;

 

·                  large online portal and
search companies, such as AOL (including AOL Travel), Yahoo! (including Yahoo!
Travel) and Google;

 

·                  traditional travel
agencies, wholesalers and tour operators;

 

·                  online travel search sites
such as Mobissimo.com, FareChase.com, Kayak.com and SideStep.com (each
sometimes referred to as “meta-search” sites) and travel research sites that
have search functionality, such as TripAdvisor, Travelzoo and Cheapflights.com;
and

 

·                  operators of travel
industry reservation databases such as Galileo, Travelport, Amadeus and Sabre.

 

Many airline, hotel and
rental car suppliers, including suppliers with which we conduct business, are
focusing on driving online demand to their own websites in lieu of third-party
distributors such as us.  Certain
suppliers have attempted to charge additional fees to customers who book
airline reservations through an online channel other than their own
website.  Furthermore, several low cost
airlines, which are having increasing success in the marketplace, distribute
their tickets exclusively through their own websites.  Suppliers who sell on their own websites typically
do not charge a processing fee, and, in some instances, offer advantages such
as web-only fares, bonus miles or loyalty points, which could make their
offerings more attractive to consumers than models like ours.

 

We potentially face
competition from a number of large Internet companies and services that have
expertise in developing online commerce and in facilitating Internet traffic,
including Amazon.com, AOL, MSN, Google.com and Yahoo!, which compete with us
either directly or indirectly through affiliations with other e-commerce or
off-line companies.  We also compete with
“meta-search” companies, which are companies that leverage their search
technology to aggregate travel search results across supplier, travel agent and
other websites.  Some established search
engine companies as well as start-ups are attempting to enter the online travel
marketplace in this manner.  If Google,
Yahoo! or other portals decide to refer significant traffic to travel search engines,
it could result in more competition from supplier websites and higher customer
acquisition costs for third-party sites such as ours.  Competition from these and other sources
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

 

Many of our current and
potential competitors, including Internet directories, search engines and large
traditional retailers, have longer operating histories, larger customer bases,
greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial, marketing,
personnel, technical and other resources than priceline.com. Some of these
competitors may be able to secure services on more favorable terms than we can.
In addition, many of these competitors may be able to devote significantly
greater resources to:

·                  marketing and promotional campaigns;

·                  attracting traffic to their websites;

·                  attracting and retaining key employees;

·                  securing vendors and supply; and

·                  website and systems development.

 

Increased competition could
result in reduced operating margins, loss of market share and damage to our
brand. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully
against current and future competitors or that competition will not have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

 

Worldwide recession increases
the likelihood that holders of our convertible senior notes will elect to
convert their notes prior to maturity.

 

In
the past several months, the world financial markets — and in particular the
world debt markets — have experienced major disruptions, causing investors to
liquidate investment holdings in favor of the relative safety of cash and/or
government backed securities.  The
holders of our convertible senior notes are primarily hedge funds whose investment
pools are subject to such investor demands for liquidity.  Given the worldwide
recession, significant investor redemptions and withdrawals from hedge
funds by their underlying investors are likely. 
Accordingly, a potentially significant number of hedge funds that hold
our convertible senior notes could be forced to convert their notes prior to
maturity in order to meet these investor demands.  For example, since September 30, 2008,
we received conversion notices for approximately $58 million of our convertible
senior notes. Any such conversion activity exposes us to several potential
risks, including without limitation:

 

·                  Early
conversions of a significant amount of our convertible senior notes would
reduce our cash and investment balances.  We would likely fund any
conversion obligations with existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments, long-term investments and borrowings under our revolving credit
facility.  While we currently have
sufficient cash and investment balances to fund early conversions, if a
significant amount of convertible senior notes were to be converted, our cash
and investment balances would be significantly reduced.

 

·                  In
certain circumstances, our Conversion Spread Hedges could be ineffective.  In connection with the issuance in a private placement of $172.5
million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due September 30,
2011, with an interest rate of 0.50% (the “2011 Notes”), and $172.5 million
aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due September 30,
2013, with an interest rate of 0.75% (the “2013 Notes”), we purchased certain
Conversion Spread Hedges that entitle us to purchase from Goldman Sachs and
Merrill Lynch approximately 8.5 million shares of our common stock (the number
of shares underlying the 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes) at a strike price of
$40.38 per share (subject to adjustment in certain circumstances) in 2011 and
2013, and the hedging counterparties are entitled to purchase from us
approximately 8.5 million shares of our common stock at a strike price of
$50.47 per share (subject to adjustment in certain circumstances) in 2011 and
2013.  We purchased the Conversion Spread Hedges in order to increase the
effective conversion price of the 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes to $50.47 per
share from the stated conversion price of $40.38 per share, thereby reducing
the potential dilution upon the expected conversion of the 2011 Notes and the
2013 Notes at their maturity dates.   The
Conversion Spread Hedges do not immediately hedge against the associated
dilution from conversions of our notes prior to their stated maturities.  Therefore, if the holders of the 2011 Notes
or the 2013 Notes elect to convert all or a portion of their notes prior to
maturity, we will be obligated to immediately deliver any related conversion
premium in shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares.  However, our hedging counterparties will not
be obligated to deliver us shares or cash that would offset the dilution
associated with the early 

 

20












Table

conversion activity until 2011 and 2013.  Because of this potential timing difference,
it is possible that the number of shares, if any, that we receive from our
Conversion Hedge Spread could differ materially from the number of shares, if
any, that we are required to deliver to holders of our notes upon their early
conversion.  This potential difference in
timing potentially makes the hedges ineffective, which could negatively impact
our future diluted shares outstanding and diluted earnings per share.

 

·                  Early
conversions of our convertible senior notes would subject us to accelerated
recognition of debt issuance expense.  In connection with the issuance of our
convertible senior notes, we incurred certain debt issuance costs that we carry
on our balance sheet as “Other Assets”. 
The current unamortized value of our debt issuance costs is $6.3
million.  These debt issuance costs are
amortized over the period beginning with the date on which the notes were
issued and ending on their stated maturity date or the first stated put date,
if applicable.   However, in the event
that some or all of our convertible senior notes are converted prior to their
expected maturity date, we will be required to accelerate the expense of some
or all of the carrying value of our debt issuance costs.  As a result, we would experience a
significant increase in our interest expense for the period in which the
acceleration occurs.  While such an
expense would be non-cash in nature and would generally not be recurring, it
could have a negative impact on our earnings for the period in which we
recognize such an expense.

 

We are exposed to various counterparty risks.

 

We
are party to derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to foreign currency
exchange rate fluctuation, as well as potential dilution upon conversion of our
convertible senior notes.  As of December 31,
2008, we are party to foreign currency contracts with a notional value of
approximately 25.0 million Euros.  The
counterparties to these contracts are JPMorganChase and Morgan Stanley.  On the maturity dates of these contracts, the
counterparties are potentially obligated to pay us the net settlement
value.  The counterparties to our
Conversion Spread Hedges are Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch.  Under the Conversion Spread Hedges, we are
entitled to purchase from the counterparties approximately 8.5 million shares
of our common stock (the number of shares underlying the 2011 Notes and the
2013 Notes) at a strike price of $40.38 per share (subject to adjustment in
certain circumstances) and the counterparties are entitled to purchase from us
approximately 8.5 million shares of our common stock at a strike price of
$50.47 per share (subject to adjustment in certain circumstances).  The
Conversion Spread Hedges increase the effective conversion price of the 2011
Notes and the 2013 Notes to $50.47 per share from our perspective and are
designed to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the 2011 Notes and
the 2013 Notes. If the market value per share of our common stock at maturity
is above $40.38, the Conversion Spread Hedge will entitle us to receive from
the counterparties net shares of our common stock based on the excess of the
then current market price of our common stock over the strike price of the
hedge (up to $50.47).  If any of the
counterparties to these derivative instruments were to liquidate, declare
bankruptcy or otherwise cease operations, it may not satisfy its obligations
under these derivative instruments.  In
such event, our fully diluted share count would be increased, which would
negatively impact our fully diluted earnings per share.

 

Our business could be negatively affected by
changes in search engine algorithms and dynamics or termination of
traffic-generating arrangements.

 

We utilize Internet search
engines and other travel demand aggregation websites, principally through the
purchase of travel-related keywords, to generate traffic to our websites.  Our international operations, in particular, rely to a significant
extent upon Google to generate business and, to a much lesser extent, other
search engines and other travel demand aggregation websites.  Search engines such as Google frequently
update and change the logic which determines the placement and display of
results of a user’s search, such that the placement of links to our sites, and
particularly those of our international operations and their affiliates, can be negatively
affected.  In a similar way, a
significant amount of our international business is directed to our own websites through participation
in pay-per-click advertising 

 

21












Table of Contents

 

campaigns on Internet search engines whose pricing
and operating dynamics can experience rapid change commercially, technically
and competitively.  In addition, we
purchase web traffic from a number of sources, including some operated by our
competitors, in the form of pay-per-click arrangements that can be terminated
with little or no notice.  If one or more
of such arrangements is terminated, or if a major search engine, such as
Google, changes its algorithms in a manner that negatively affects the search
engine ranking of our brands or our third-party distribution partners or
changes its pricing, operating or competitive dynamics in a negative manner,
our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely
affected.

 

Our processing, storage, use and disclosure
of personal data exposes us to risks of internal or external security breaches
and could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation,
conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights.

 

The security of data when
engaging in electronic commerce is essential in maintaining consumer and
supplier confidence in the priceline.com services. Substantial or ongoing
security breaches whether instigated internally or externally on our system or
other Internet based systems could significantly harm our business. We
currently require customers who use certain of our services to guarantee their
offers with their credit card, either online or, in some instances, through our
toll-free telephone service. It is possible that advances in computer
circumvention capabilities, new discoveries or other developments, including
our own acts or omissions, could result in a compromise or breach of customer
transaction data.

 

We cannot guarantee that
our existing security measures will prevent security breaches or attacks. A
party (whether internal, external, an affiliate or unrelated third party) that
is able to circumvent our security systems could steal customer information or
transaction data, proprietary information or cause significant interruptions in
our operations. For instance, from time to time, we have experienced
“denial-of-service” type attacks on our system that have made portions of our
websites slow or unavailable for periods of time.  We may need to expend significant resources
to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches,
and reductions in website availability and response time could cause loss of
substantial business volumes during the occurrence of any such incident.  These issues are likely to become more
difficult as we expand the number of places where we operate and as the tools
and techniques used in such attacks become more advanced.  Security breaches could result in negative
publicity, damage our reputation, expose us to risk of loss or litigation and
possible liability and subject us to regulatory penalties. Security breaches
could also cause customers and potential customers to lose confidence in our
security, which would have a negative effect on the value of our brand.  Our insurance policies carry low coverage
limits, and would likely not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by
security breaches.

 

Companies that we have
acquired, such as our international operations, and that we may acquire in the
future, may employ security and networking standards at levels we find
unsatisfactory.  The process of enhancing
infrastructure to attain improved security and network standards may be time
consuming and expensive and may require resources and expertise that are
difficult to obtain.  Such acquisitions
increase the number of potential vulnerabilities, and can cause delays in
detection of an attack, as well as the timelines of recovery from any given
attack. Failure to raise any such standards that we find unsatisfactory could
expose us to security breaches of, among other things, personal customer data
and credit card information that would have an adverse impact on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

 

We also face risks
associated with security breaches affecting third parties conducting business
over the Internet. Consumers generally are concerned with security and privacy
on the Internet, and any publicized security problems could inhibit the growth
of the Internet and, therefore, the priceline.com service as a means of
conducting commercial transactions. 
Additionally, security breaches at the third-party, supplier or
distributor systems upon which we rely could result in negative publicity,
damage our

reputation, expose us to risk of loss or litigation
and possible liability and subject us to regulatory penalties.

 

In our processing of travel
transactions, we receive and store a large volume of personally identifiable
data.  This data is increasingly subject
to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world,
including the Commission of the European Union through its Data Protection
Directive and variations of that directive in the member states of the European
Union.  This government action is
typically intended to protect the privacy of personal data that is collected,
processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction.  We could be adversely affected if legislation
or regulations are expanded to require changes in our business practices or if
governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations
in ways that negatively affect our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

 

In addition, in the
aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 in the United
States, government agencies have been contemplating or developing initiatives
to enhance national and aviation security, such as the Transportation Security
Administration’s Computer-Assisted Passenger Prescreening System, known as
CAPPS II.  These initiatives may result
in conflicting legal requirements with respect to data handling.  As privacy and data protection has become a
more sensitive issue, we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a
result of differing views on the privacy of travel data.  Travel businesses have also been subjected to
investigations, lawsuits and adverse publicity due to allegedly improper disclosure
of passenger information.  These and
other privacy developments that are difficult to anticipate could adversely
impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.

 

Adverse application of state and local tax laws
could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operation.

 

Several
jurisdictions have initiated lawsuits against many on-line travel companies,
including us, alleging among other things, that sales or hotel occupancy tax is
applicable to the differential between the price paid by a customer for our
service and the cost of the underlying room. In addition, a number of
jurisdictions have initiated audit proceedings against us purportedly to
determine whether taxes are owed on this differential or issued assessments
claiming that we owe tax on this differential for prior periods.  Additional state and local jurisdictions
could assert that we are subject to sales or hotel occupancy taxes on this
differential and could seek to collect such taxes, either retroactively or
prospectively, or both. Historically, we have not collected taxes on this
differential. Such actions may result in substantial liabilities for past
and/or future sales and could have a material adverse effect our business and
results of operations.  To the extent
that any tax authority succeeds in asserting that any such tax collection
responsibility exists, it is likely that, with respect to future transactions,
we would collect any such additional tax obligation from our customers, which
would have the effect of increasing the cost of hotel room reservations to our
customers and, consequently, could reduce hotel reservation transactions.  We will continue to assess the risks of the
potential financial impact of additional tax exposure, and to the extent
appropriate, we will reserve for those estimates of liabilities.

 

In addition, we may be required in certain jurisdictions to pay tax
assessments, which may be substantial, prior to contesting the validity of such
assessments. This requirement is commonly referred to as “pay to play.” Payment
of these amounts is not an admission that the tax payer believes it is subject
to such taxes. We continue to work with relevant tax authorities to clarify our
obligations under existing, new and emerging laws and regulations. There have
been, and will continue to be, substantial ongoing costs, which may include
“pay to play” payments, associated with complying with, and defending our
position in, the various indirect tax requirements in the numerous markets in
which we conduct or will conduct business.

 

Recession
in the United States is triggering active consideration on ways to generate
additional tax revenues by the federal, state and local governments. We cannot
predict what changes in tax law or interpretations of such laws may be adopted
or assure that such changes or interpretations would not materially impact our
business.

 

We rely on the performance of
highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key
personnel or hire, retain and motivate qualified personnel, our business would
be harmed.

 

Our performance is largely dependent on the
talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Our future success depends
on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain
highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization.  In particular, the contributions of certain
key senior management in the U.S. and Europe are critical to the overall
management of the company.  In addition,
because our European senior management’s minority ownership interest was
repurchased in September 

 

23












Table of Contents

 

2008, it may become more difficult to retain these senior managers over
time.  We cannot ensure that we will be
able to retain the services of any members of our senior management or other
key employees, the loss of whom could harm our business.

 

In addition, competition for well-qualified
employees in all aspects of our business, including software engineers and
other technology professionals, is intense both in the U.S. and abroad.  With the recent success of our international
business and the increased profile of the Booking.com business and brand,
competitors have increased their efforts to hire our international
employees.  Our continued ability to
compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to
retain and motivate existing employees. 
If we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining
and motivating existing employees, our business would be adversely affected. We
do not maintain any key person life insurance policies.

 

Our expansion places a significant strain on our management, technical,
operational and financial resources.

 

We have rapidly and significantly expanded our
international operations and anticipate expanding further to pursue growth of
our service offerings and customer base. For example, the number of our
employees worldwide has grown from less than 700 in the first quarter of 2007, to
approximately 1,780 as of February 1, 2009, which growth is almost
entirely comprised of hires by our international operations.  Such expansion increases the complexity of
our business and places a significant strain on our management, operations, technical
performance, financial resources and internal financial control and reporting
functions.

 

There can be no assurance that we will be able to
manage our expansion effectively.  Our
current and planned personnel, systems, procedures and controls may not be
adequate to support and effectively manage our future operations, especially as
we employ personnel in multiple geographic locations.  We may not be able to hire, train, retain,
motivate and manage required personnel, which may limit our growth, damage our
reputation, negatively affect our financial performance, and harm our business.

 

Capacity constraints and system failures could harm
our business.

 

We rely on certain third
party computer systems and third party service providers, including the computerized
central reservation systems of the airline, hotel and rental car industries to
satisfy demand for airline tickets and domestic hotel room and rental car
reservations. In particular, our domestic travel business is substantially
dependent upon the computerized reservation systems of operators of global
distribution systems for the travel industry. Any interruption in these third
party services systems or deterioration in their performance could prevent us
from booking airline, hotel and rental car reservations and have a material
adverse effect on our business. Our agreements with some third party service
providers are terminable upon short notice and often do not provide recourse
for service interruptions. In the event our arrangement with any of such third
parties is terminated, we may not be able to find an alternative source of
systems support on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms and, as a
result, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

 

We depend upon Paymentech
to process our U.S. credit card transactions, and e-clearing, WorldPay and
others to process Agoda credit card transactions. If any of these providers
were wholly or partially compromised, our cash flows could be disrupted until
such a time as a replacement process could be put in place with a different
vendor.  As we add complexity to our
systems infrastructure by adding new suppliers and distribution, our total
system availability could decline and our results could suffer.

 

A substantial amount of our
computer hardware for operating our services is currently located at the
facilities of SAVVIS in New Jersey, AT&T in New York City, Equinix Europe
Ltd. in London, England, Global Switch Amsterdam B.V. and TelecityRedbus in the
Netherlands. These systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or
interruption from human error, floods, fires, power loss, 

 

24












Table of Contents

 

telecommunication failures and similar events. They
are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and
similar misconduct. Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of any
disruption of service due to any such misconduct, natural disaster or other
unanticipated problems at the SAVVIS facility, the AT&T facility, the
Equinix Europe Ltd. facility or the TelecityRedbus and Global Switch Amsterdam
B.V. facility could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. In
addition, the failure by SAVVIS, Verizon, AT&T, Equinix Europe Ltd., Colt
Telecom Group Limited, Verizon Business B.V., or TrueServer B.V. to provide our
required data communications capacity could result in interruptions in our service.
Any system failure that causes an interruption in service or decreases the
responsiveness of our services could impair our reputation, damage our brand
name and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
and financial condition.

 

We
do not have a completely formalized disaster recovery plan in every geographic
region in which we conduct business.  In the event of certain system
failures, we may not be able to switch to back-up systems immediately and the
time to full recovery could be prolonged. 
Like many online businesses, we have
experienced system failures from time to time. In addition to placing increased
burdens on our engineering staff, these outages create a significant amount of
user questions and complaints that need to be addressed by our customer support
personnel. Any unscheduled interruption in our service could result in an
immediate loss of revenues that can be substantial and may cause some users to
switch to our competitors. If we experience frequent or persistent system
failures, our reputation and brand could be permanently harmed. We have been
taking steps to increase the reliability and redundancy of our systems. These
steps are expensive, may reduce our margins and may not be successful in
reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime.

 

We use both internally
developed systems and third-party systems to operate our services, including
transaction processing, order management and financial systems. If the number
of users of our services increases substantially, or if critical third-party
systems stop operating as designed, we will need to significantly expand and
upgrade our technology, transaction processing systems, financial and
accounting systems and other infrastructure. We do not know whether we will be
able to upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate such conditions
in a timely manner, and, depending on the third-party systems affected, our
transactional, financial and accounting systems could be impacted for a
meaningful amount of time before repair.

 

If our systems cannot be
expanded to cope with increased demand or fails to perform, we could
experience:

 

·                  unanticipated disruptions in service;

·                  slower response times;

·                  decreased customer service and customer satisfaction; or

·                  delays in the introduction of new services,

 

any of which could impair our reputation, damage our
brands and materially and adversely affect our revenues.  While we do maintain redundant systems and
hosting services for some of our business, it is possible that we could
experience an interruption in our business, and we do not carry business interruption
insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur.

 

Companies that we have
acquired, such as our international operations, and that we may acquire in the
future, may present known or unknown capacity/stability or other types of
system challenges.  The process of enhancing
infrastructure to attain improved capacity/scalability and other system
characteristics may be time consuming and expensive and may require resources
and expertise that are difficult to obtain. 
Such acquisitions increase potential downtime, customer facing problems
and compliance problems.  Failure to
successfully make any such improvements to such infrastructures could expose us
to potential capacity, stability, and system problems that would have an
adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We have integrated the
majority of our international agency hotel
offerings into a single back-office extranet system operated by Booking.com
B.V., in order to allow customers of both Booking.com B.V. and Booking.com
Limited to access hotels which may have previously been available only through
either Booking.com B.V. or Booking.com Limited. 
Because all of our international operations’ agency hotel offerings are therefore
on one platform, in the event that the extranet operated by Booking.com B.V.
experiences a system failure, our international
operations could be unable to generate hotel bookings, which would have
a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

 

Our financial results will
be materially impacted by payment of cash income taxes in the future.

 

Due to our significant net
operating loss carryforwards, we do not expect to pay cash taxes on our U.S.
federal taxable income tax for the foreseeable future.  We expect to make cash payments for U.S.
alternative minimum tax and for certain international taxes.  We expect that our international operations
will grow their pretax income at higher rates than the U.S. over the long term
and, therefore, it is our expectation that our cash tax rate and cash tax
payments will increase as our international business generates an increasing
share of our pretax income.

 

The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an accounting rule change
that will significantly impact the accounting for our convertible debt.

 

The
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
issued FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1, “Accounting for Convertible Debt
Instruments that May be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial
Cash Settlement)” (“FSP APB 14-1”).  FSP
APB 14-1 requires cash settled convertible debt, such as our convertible senior
notes, to be separated into debt and equity components at issuance and a value
to be assigned to each.  The value
assigned to the debt component would be the estimated fair value, as of the
issuance date, of a similar bond without the conversion feature.  The difference between the bond cash proceeds
and this estimated fair value, representing the value assigned to the equity
component, would be recorded as a debt discount and amortized to interest
expense over the life of the bond.  In
addition, if our convertible debt is redeemed or converted prior to maturity
and the fair value of the debt component immediately prior to extinguishment
exceeds the carrying value it will result in a loss on extinguishment.  Although FSP APB 14-1 will have no impact on
our actual past or future cash flows, it will require us to record a significant
amount of non-cash interest expense as the debt discount is amortized and may
result in losses on extinguishment that would not have occurred under previous
GAAP.  FSP APB 14-1 is effective for
financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2008, and must be applied on a retrospective basis.  We estimate that the adoption of FSP APB 14-1
will increase non-cash interest expense for the years ended December 31,
2008, 2007 and 2006 by approximately $26 million ($16 million net of tax), $28
million ($17 million net of tax),  and $6
million ($3.6 million net of tax), respectively.  The estimated impact to fiscal year 2009
non-cash interest expense is expected to be an increase of approximately $21
million ($13 million net of tax), excluding the impact of future debt conversions,
if any.  We estimate that adoption of FSP
APB 14-1 will also result in a gain on extinguishment of debt of approximately
$5 million ($3 million net of tax) for the year ended December 31, 2008.

 

Acquisitions could result in
operating difficulties.

 

As part of our business
strategy, in September 2004, we acquired Booking.com Limited, in July 2005,
Booking.com B.V. and, in November 2007, Agoda.  We may enter into additional business
combinations and acquisitions in the future. 
Acquisitions may result in dilutive issuances of equity securities, use
of our cash resources, incurrence of debt and amortization of expenses related
to intangible assets acquired.  In
addition, the process of integrating an acquired company, business or
technology may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures.  The acquisitions of Booking.com B.V., Booking.com Limited, and Agoda were accompanied by a number of risks,
including, without limitation:

 

·                  the need to implement or remediate controls, procedures and policies
appropriate for a larger public company at companies that prior to the
acquisitions may have lacked such controls, procedures and policies;

 

26












Table of Contents

 

·                  the difficulty of
assimilating the operations and personnel of Booking.com Limited, which are
principally located in Cambridge, England, Booking.com B.V., which are
principally located in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and Agoda, which are
principally located in Singapore and Bangkok, Thailand, with and into our
operations, which are headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut;

·                  the potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of
management;

·                  the difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and rights into our
services and unanticipated expenses related to such integration;

·                  the failure to further successfully develop acquired technology resulting
in the impairment of amounts currently capitalized as intangible assets;

·                  the impairment of relationships with customers of Booking.com
B.V., Booking.com Limited and Agoda or our own
customers as a result of any integration of operations;

·                  the impairment of relationships with employees of Booking.com B.V.,
Booking.com Limited and Agoda or our own business as a result of any
integration of new management personnel;

·                  the potential unknown liabilities associated with Booking.com B.V.,
Booking.com Limited and Agoda.

 

We may experience similar
risks in connection with any future acquisitions. We may not be successful in
addressing these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with the
acquisitions of Booking.com
B.V., Booking.com Limited or Agoda, or that we
could encounter in future acquisitions, which would harm our business or cause
us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions.  As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately $481 million assigned
primarily to the intangible assets and goodwill of Booking.com B.V.,
Booking.com Limited and Agoda, and therefore,
the occurrence of any of the risks identified above could result in a material
adverse impact, including an impairment of these assets, which could cause us
to have to record a charge for impairment. 
Any such charge could adversely impact our operating results, which
would likely cause our stock price to decline significantly.

 

We may not be able to keep
up with rapid technological and other changes.

 

The markets in which we
compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry
standards, consolidation, frequent new service announcements, introductions and
enhancements and changing consumer demands. We may not be able to keep up with
these rapid changes. In addition, these market characteristics are heightened
by the emerging nature of the Internet and the apparent need of companies from
many industries to offer Internet based services. As a result, our future
success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies,
to adapt our services to evolving industry standards and to continually improve
the performance, features and reliability of our service in response to
competitive service offerings and the evolving demands of the marketplace. In
addition, the widespread adoption of new Internet, networking or
telecommunications technologies or other technological changes could require us
to incur substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our services or
infrastructure.

 

We rely on the value of the
priceline.com and Booking.com brands, along with others, and the costs of
maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness are increasing.

 

We believe that maintaining
and expanding the priceline.com brand, and other owned brands, including Booking.com,
Active Hotels, Agoda, Lowestfare.com, Rentalcars.com, Breezenet.com,
MyTravelGuide.com and Travelweb, are important aspects of our efforts to
attract and expand our user and advertiser base.  As our larger competitors spend increasingly
more on advertising, we are required to spend more in order to maintain our
brand recognition.  In addition, we have
spent considerable money and resources to date on the establishment and
maintenance of the priceline.com brands, and we will continue to spend money
on, and devote resources to advertising, marketing and other brand building
efforts to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of the priceline.com brands.
We may not be able to successfully maintain or enhance consumer awareness of
the priceline.com brands, and, even if we are 

 

27












Table of Contents

 

successful in our branding efforts, such efforts may
not be cost-effective. If we are unable to maintain or enhance customer
awareness of the priceline.com brands in a cost-effective manner, our business,
results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.

 

Our outstanding convertible senior notes
could result in substantial shareholder dilution.

 

Our convertible senior
notes are convertible into shares of our common stock if certain specified
conditions are met.  All of our
convertible notes are currently convertible. 
Upon conversion, the holder will receive cash for the principal amount
of the note and cash or shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and
shares of our common stock for the conversion value in excess of such principal
amount.  If our stock trades above the
conversion prices of the outstanding convertible notes, our diluted share count
will increase by the net number of shares that would become issuable to the
holders of our outstanding convertible notes and, as a consequence, have a
dilutive impact on net income per share. 
As an example, at
stock prices of $40 per share, $60 per share, $80 per share and $100 per share,
common equivalent shares would include approximately 0.1 million, 3.3 million,
5.0 million and 6.0 million equivalent shares, respectively, related to the
remaining outstanding convertible notes (excluding
the offsetting impact of the Conversion Spread Hedges described in Note 13 to
our Consolidated Financial Statements). 
The Conversion Spread Hedges increase the effective conversion
price of the 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes from $40.38 to $50.47 per share, and
reduce the dilution upon conversion of the 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes.  Since the impact of the Conversion Spread
Hedges is anti-dilutive it is excluded from the calculation of net income per
share under GAAP until they are exercised upon maturity.

 

We will be subject to increased income taxes
in the event that our foreign cash balances are remitted to the United States.

 

As of December 31, 2008, we held approximately $181.6 million of
cash and short-term liquid investments outside of the United States.  To date, we have used our foreign cash to
reinvest in our foreign operations.  It
is our current expectation to continue to seek ways to make further investments
in our foreign operations with our foreign cash.  If our foreign cash balances continue to grow
and our ability to reinvest those balances diminishes, it will become
increasingly likely that we will repatriate some of our foreign cash balances
to the United States.  In such event, we
would likely be subject to additional income tax expenses in the United States
with respect to our unremitted foreign earnings.  We would not incur an increase in cash income
taxes payable unless we no longer have net operating loss carryforwards
available to offset the taxable income.

 

The unit profitability of our airline ticket business has declined and
could continue to decline, as we may be subject to, among other things,
competitive pressure and loss or reduction of global distribution system fees.

 

In
recent quarters, the amount of profit we make per airline ticket sold has
declined and could continue to decline as we, among other things, experience
pressure from suppliers to reduce our profit, strive to remain competitive with
other online travel agencies and continue to be subject to reduction of global
distribution system, or GDS, fees paid to us. 
Historically, we have relied on fees paid to us by GDSs for travel bookings made through GDSs for a portion
of our gross profit and a substantial portion of our operating income. We
rebate certain GDS costs to certain suppliers (e.g., airlines, hotels, etc.) in
exchange for contractual considerations such as those relating to pricing and
availability, and expect to continue to do so in the future.  Airlines put pressure on us to reduce our
aggregate compensation and book through lower cost channels to receive
airlines’ full content and avoid airline service fees.  We have agreements with a number of airlines
to obtain access to airline content, and are in continuing discussions with
others to obtain similar access.  If we
were denied access to airlines’ full content or had to impose 

 

28

service fees on our airline tickets, it could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

 

Additionally, some travel
suppliers are encouraging third-party travel intermediaries, such as us, to
develop technology to bypass the traditional GDSs, such as enabling direct
connections to the travel suppliers or using alternative global distribution
methods.  Development of the technology
to connect to such alternatives, or to enable direct connections to travel suppliers,
requires the use of information technology resources and could cause us to
incur additional operating expenses, increase the frequency/duration of system
problems and delay other projects.

 

We face risks related to our
intellectual property.

 

We regard our intellectual
property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright and
patent law, trade secret protection and confidentiality and/or license
agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our
proprietary rights. If we are not successful in protecting our intellectual
property, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

 

While we believe that our
issued patents and pending patent applications help to protect our business,
there can be no assurance that:

 

·                  any patent can be successfully defended against challenges by third
parties;

·                  pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents;

·                  competitors or potential competitors of priceline.com will not devise new
methods of competing with us that are not covered by our patents or patent
applications;

·                  because of variations in the application of our business model to each of
our services, our patents will be effective in preventing one or more third
parties from utilizing a copycat business model to offer the same service in
one or more categories;

·                  new prior art will not be discovered which may diminish the value of or
invalidate an issued patent;

·                  a third party will not have or obtain one or more patents that prevent us
from practicing features of our business or require us to pay for a license to
use those features; or

·                  our operations do not or will not infringe valid, enforceable patents of
third parties.

 

There has been recent
discussion in the press regarding the examination and issuance of so called
“business method” patents. As a result, the United States Patent and Trademark
Office has indicated that it intends to intensify the review process applicable
to such patent applications. The new procedures are not expected to have a
direct effect on patents already granted. We cannot anticipate what effect, if
any, the new review process will have on our pending patent applications.  In addition, there has been recent discussion in various
federal court proceedings regarding the patentability and validity of so called
“business method” patents. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, in a
recent order in In re Bilski, has questioned whether it
should review its earlier decision affirming the patentability of so-called
business method patents in State Street Bank v. Signature Financial.  
We cannot anticipate what effect, if any, any new federal court decision will
have on our issued patents or pending patent applications.

 

We pursue the registration
of our trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and internationally. However,
effective trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may
not be available in every country in which our services are made available
online. We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future,
certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material,
to third parties. These licensees may take actions that might diminish the
value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation.

From time to time, in the
ordinary course of our business, we have been subject to, and are currently
subject to, legal proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property
rights of others, and we expect that third parties will continue to assert
intellectual property claims, in particular patent claims, against us,
particularly as we expand the complexity and scope of our business.  We endeavor to defend our intellectual
property rights diligently, but intellectual property litigation is extremely
expensive and time consuming, and has and is likely to continue to divert
managerial attention and resources from our business objectives.  Successful infringement claims against us
could result in significant monetary liability or prevent us from operating our
business, or portions of our business. 
In addition, resolution of claims may require us to obtain licenses to
use intellectual property rights belonging to third parties, which may be
expensive to procure, or possibly to cease using those rights altogether.  Any of these events could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

 

Our business is
exposed to risks associated with credit card fraud and charge backs.

 

To date, our results have
been negatively impacted by purchases made using fraudulent credit cards.
Because we act as the merchant-of-record in a majority of our domestic
transactions as well as those of Agoda, we may be held liable for accepting
fraudulent credit cards on our websites as well as other payment disputes with
our customers. Additionally, we are held liable for accepting fraudulent credit
cards in certain retail transactions when we do not act as merchant of
record.  Accordingly, we calculate and
record an allowance for the resulting credit card charge backs.  If we are unable to combat the use of fraudulent
credit cards on our websites, our business, results of operations and financial
condition could be materially adversely affected.

 

Fluctuations in our
financial results make quarterly comparisons and financial forecasting
difficult.

 

Our
revenues and operating results have varied significantly from quarter to
quarter because our business experiences seasonal fluctuations, which reflect
seasonal trends for the travel services offered by our websites. Traditional
leisure travel bookings in the United States are higher in the second and third
calendar quarters of the year as consumers take spring and summer vacations. In
the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year, demand for travel services
in the United States and Europe generally declines and the number of bookings
flattens.  Furthermore, prior to
introducing a retail travel option to our customers, substantially all of our
business was conducted under the Name Your
Own Price® system and
accordingly, because those services are non-refundable in nature, we recognize
travel revenue at the time a booking was generated.  We recognize revenue generated from our
retail hotel service, however, including our international operations, at the time
that the customer checks out of the hotel. 
As a result, we have seen and expect to continue to see, that a
meaningful amount of retail hotel bookings generated earlier in the year, as
customers plan and reserve their spring and summer vacations, will not be
recognized until future quarters.  This
could result in a disproportionate amount of our annual earnings being
recognized in later quarters.

 

Our results may also be
affected by seasonal fluctuations in the supply made available to us by
airlines, hotels and rental car suppliers. Our revenues and operating results
may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter because of these
factors. As a result, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues and
operating results may not be meaningful. In addition, due to our limited
operating history, a relatively new and unproven business model and an
uncertain environment in the travel industry, it may be difficult to predict
our future revenues or results of operations. 
A significant change in the global economic environment, such as we are
currently experiencing as a result of the worldwide recession, makes it more
difficult to forecast future operating results.

 

Because of these
fluctuations and uncertainties, our operating results may fail to meet the
expectations of securities analysts and investors. If this happens, the trading
price of our common stock would almost certainly be materially adversely
affected.

Our stock price is highly volatile.

 

The market price of our common
stock is highly volatile and is likely to continue to be subject to wide
fluctuations in response to factors such as the following, some of which are
beyond our control:

 

·                  quarterly variations in our operating results;

·                  operating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts
and investors;

·                  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including
financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;

·                  changes in our capital structure;

·                  changes in market valuations of other Internet or online service companies;

·                  announcements of technological innovations or new services by us or our
competitors;

·                  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts,
acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;

·                  loss of a major supplier participant, such as an airline or hotel chain;

·                  changes in the status of our intellectual property rights;

·                  lack of success in the expansion of our business model geographically;

·                  announcements by third parties of significant claims or proceedings against
us or adverse developments in pending proceedings;

·                  occurrences of a significant security breach;

·                  additions or departures of key personnel; and

·                  stock market price and volume fluctuations.

 

Sales of a substantial
number of shares of our common stock could adversely affect the market price of
our common stock by introducing a large number of sellers to the market. Given
the volatility that exists for our shares, such sales could cause the market
price of our common stock to decline significantly. In addition, fluctuations
in our stock price and our price-to-earnings multiple may have made our stock
attractive to momentum, hedge or day-trading investors who often shift funds
into and out of stocks rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either
direction, particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis.

 

The trading prices of
Internet company stocks in general, including ours, have experienced extreme
price and volume fluctuations. To the extent that the public’s perception of
the prospects of Internet or e-commerce companies is negative, our stock price
could decline further, regardless of our results. Other broad market and
industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless
of our operating performance. Market fluctuations, as well as general political
and economic conditions, such as a recession or interest rate or currency rate
fluctuations, also may decrease the market price of our common stock.  Negative market conditions could adversely
affect our ability to raise additional capital.

 

We are defendants in
securities class action litigations. In the past, securities class action
litigation often has been brought against a company following periods of
volatility in the market price of its securities. To the extent our stock price
declines or is volatile, we may in the future be the target of additional
litigation. This additional litigation could result in substantial costs and
divert management’s attention and resources.

We are party to legal
proceedings which, if adversely decided, could materially adversely affect us.

 

We are a party to the legal
proceedings described in Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.  The defense of the actions described in Note
18 may increase our expenses and an adverse outcome in any of such actions
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

 

Regulatory and legal
uncertainties could harm our business.

 

The services we offer through the
priceline.com service are regulated by federal and state governments. Our
ability to provide such services is and will continue to be affected by such
regulations. The implementation of unfavorable regulations or unfavorable
interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies could
require us to incur significant compliance costs, cause the development of the
affected markets to become impractical and otherwise have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  See “Uncertainty regarding state and local
taxes.”
