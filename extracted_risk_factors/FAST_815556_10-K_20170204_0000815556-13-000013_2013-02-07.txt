We had 2,652 store locations at year end. The various geographic areas in which we operate these store locations are summarized later.Globally, we employed 15,145 people as of year end. We characterize these personnel as follows:Store and in-plant 10,158Non-store selling1,111  Selling sub-total11,269Distribution2,451Manufacturing569Administrative856  Non-selling sub-total3,876Total15,145We sell industrial and construction supplies in a wholesale and retail fashion. These industrial and construction supplies are grouped into eleven product lines described later in this document.We operated 14 distribution centers in North America as of year end from which we distribute products to our store and in-plant locations.Our Internet address for corporate and investor information is www.fastenal.com. The information contained on this website or connected to this website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this report.Development of the BusinessFastenal began in 1967 with a marketing strategy of supplying threaded fasteners to customers in small, medium-sized, and, in subsequent years, large cities. We believe our success can be attributed to our ability to offer our customers a full line of products at convenient locations and to the high quality of our employees.We opened our first store in Winona, Minnesota, a city with a population of approximately 25,000. The following table shows our consolidated net sales for each fiscal year during the last ten years and the number of our store locations at the end of each of the last ten years: 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003Net sales (in millions)$3,133.6 $2,766.9 2,269.5 1,930.3 2,340.4 2,061.8 1,809.3 1,523.3 1,238.5 994.9Number of stores at year end2,652 2,585 2,490 2,369 2,311 2,160 2,000 1,755 1,533 1,3144Table of ContentsAt year end, we operated the following number of store locations:    2012 2011North AmericaUnited States 2,380 2,335 Puerto Rico & Dominican Republic 9 9 Canada 195 183 Mexico 36 34 Sub-total 2,620 2,561Central & South AmericaPanama, Brazil, & Colombia 4 3AsiaChina 8 8Southeast AsiaSingapore, Malaysia, & Thailand 7 4EuropeThe Netherlands, Hungary, United Kingdom, Germany, Czech Republic, Italy & Romania 13 9Total  2,652 2,585We select new locations for our stores based on their proximity to our distribution network, population statistics, and employment data for manufacturing and construction. Beginning in 2007, we disclosed our intention to continue opening new store locations at a rate of approximately 7% to 10% per year (calculated on the ending number of stores in the previous year). Given the economic slowdown, we decreased this to a range of 2% to 5% in 2009, and this lower rate continued into the first half of 2010. From July 2010 to December 2010, we opened stores at an annualized rate of approximately 7%. In 2011, we opened new stores at the rate of approximately 5%, and opened new stores at the rate of approximately 3% in 2012.  We expect to open 65 to 80 stores in 2013, or a rate of approximately 2.5% to 3%.We stock all new stores with inventory drawn from all of our product lines. Subsequent to a new opening, store and district personnel may supplement the inventory offering to customize the selection to the needs of our local customer base.We currently have several versions of selling locations. The first type of selling location – a Fastenal store location – is either (1) a ‘traditional’ store, which services a wide variety of customers and stocks a wide selection of all the products we offer or (2) an ‘overseas’ store which focuses on manufacturing customers and on the fastener product line (this is the type of store format we have outside of North America).In addition to the Fastenal store type discussed above, we also operate strategic account stores, strategic account sites, and ‘in-plant’ sites. A strategic account store is a unique location that sells to multiple large customers in a market. Because this location sells to multiple customers, it is included in our store count. A strategic account site is essentially the same, but it typically operates out of an existing store location, rather than a unique location; therefore, it is not included in our store count. An ‘in-plant’ site is a selling unit located in or near a customer’s facility that sells product solely to that customer. ‘In-plant’ sites are not included in the store count numbers as they represent a customer subset of an existing store.We believe, based on the demographics of the marketplace in North America, that there is sufficient potential in this geographic area to support at least 3,500 total stores. Many of the new store locations may be in cities in which we currently operate. Fastenal has not operated outside of North America long enough to assess the market potential of those markets.5Table of ContentsWe opened the following stores in the last five years:  2012 2011 2010 2009 2008North AmericaUnited States58 101 111 62 138 Puerto Rico & Dominican Republic— — — 1 — Canada13 11 7 2 21 Mexico2 1 1 1 2 Sub-total73 113 119 66 161Central & South AmericaPanama, Brazil, & Colombia1 1 2 — —AsiaChina— 3 3 1 —Southeast AsiaSingapore, Malaysia, & Thailand2 — 2 1 —EuropeThe Netherlands, Hungary, United Kingdom, Germany, Czech Republic, Italy & Romania4 5 1 1 —Total 80 122 127 69 161We plan to open additional stores outside of the United States in the future. The stores located outside the United States contributed approximately 11% of our consolidated net sales in 2012, with approximately 65% of this amount attributable to our Canadian operations.No assurance can be given that any of the expansion plans described above will be achieved, or that new store locations, once opened, will be profitable.It has been our experience that near-term profitability has been adversely affected by the opening of new store locations. This adverse effect is due to the start-up costs and the time necessary to generate a customer base. A new store generates its sales from direct sales calls, a slow process involving repeated contacts. As a result of this process, sales volume builds slowly and it typically requires ten to twelve months for a new store to achieve its first profitable month, although this time frame has been longer in the current economic downturn. Of the 28 stores opened in the first quarter of 2012, 13 were profitable in the fourth quarter of 2012.6Table of ContentsThe data in the following table shows the change in the average sales of our stores from 2011 to 2012 based on the age of each store. The stores opened in 2012 contributed approximately $24,859 (or approximately 0.8%) of our consolidated net sales in 2012, with the remainder coming from stores opened prior to 2012.Age of stores onDecember 31, 2012Yearopened Number ofstores in groupon December31, 2012 Closed stores1 Averagemonthlysales2012  Averagemonthlysales2011  Percentchange0-1 year old2012 80 — $262  N/A  —1-2 years old2011 123 — 58  182  —2-3 years old2010 127 1/0 68  51  33.3%3-4 years old2009 67 0/3 104  90  15.6%4-5 years old2008 151 4/7 70  62  12.9%5-6 years old2007 152 2/6 81  70  15.7%6-7 years old2006 232 3/7 80  70  14.3%7-8 years old2005 212 4/3 74  65  13.8%8-9 years old2004 213 2/0 87  78  11.5%9-10 years old2003 144 0/2 83  75  10.7%10-11 years old2002 140 — 91  81  12.3%11-12 years old2001 124 — 110  104  5.8%12-16 years old1997-2000 405 — 113  105  7.6%16+ years old1967-1996 482 — 159  148  7.4%1 We closed 16 stores and 28 stores in 2012 and 2011, respectively. The respective average sales above were calculated assuming the store closed mid year. The number of closed stores is noted in the table above as 2012 number/2011 number. We converted three non-store selling locations to stores in 2012. We converted one non-store selling location to a store in 2011.2 The average sales include sales of stores open for less than the full fiscal year.Several years ago, we introduced our FAST SolutionsSM (industrial vending) offering and it has been a rapidly expanding component of our business. We believe industrial vending is the next logical chapter in the Fastenal story and also believe it has the potential to be transformative to industrial distribution, both because of its benefits to our customers such as reduced consumption, reduced inventory investment, reduced purchase orders, reduced product handling, and 24-hour product availability, and its benefits to us in that it allows us to strengthen our relationships with our customers and streamline the supply chain. We believe we have a 'first mover' advantage in industrial vending and are investing aggressively to maximize this advantage.  At year end, we operated eleven distribution centers in the United States—Minnesota, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Georgia, Washington, California, Utah, North Carolina, and Kansas, and three outside the United States – Ontario, Canada; Alberta, Canada; and Nuevo Leon, Mexico. These 14 distribution centers give us over 2.7 million square feet of distribution capacity. These distribution centers are located so as to permit twice-a-week to five times-a-week deliveries to our stores using our trucks and overnight delivery by surface common carrier. As the number of stores increases, we intend to add new distribution centers.We currently operate our Minnesota, Indiana, and Texas distribution centers with 'automated storage and retrieval systems' or ASRS.  These distribution centers operate with greater speed and efficiency.  We intend to invest in this type of ASRS distribution infrastructure over the next several years at our Ohio, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Kansas, and Ontario, Canada locations.Our information systems department develops, implements, and maintains the computer based technology used to support business functions within Fastenal. Corporate, e-Business, and distribution center systems are primarily supported from a central location(s), while each store uses a locally installed Point-Of-Sale (POS) system. The systems consist of both customized and purchased software. A dedicated Wide Area Network (WAN) is used to provide connectivity between systems and authorized users.7Table of ContentsTrademarks and Service MarksWe conduct business under various trademarks and service marks, and we utilize a variety of designs and tag lines in connection with each of these marks, including First In Fasteners®.  Although we do not believe our operations are substantially dependent upon any of our trademarks or service marks, we consider the ‘Fastenal’ name and our other trademarks and service marks to be valuable to our business.ProductsOur original product offerings were fasteners and other industrial and construction supplies, many of which are sold under the Fastenal® product name. This product line, which we refer to as the fastener product line, consists of two broad categories: threaded fasteners, such as bolts, nuts, screws, studs, and related washers; and miscellaneous supplies and hardware, such as various pins and machinery keys, concrete anchors, metal framing systems, wire rope, strut, rivets, and related accessories.Threaded fasteners are used in most manufactured products and building projects, and in the maintenance and repair of machines and structures. Many aspects of the threaded fastener market are common to all cities. Variations from city to city that do exist typically relate to the types of businesses operating in a market or to the environmental conditions in a market. Therefore, we open each store with a broad selection of base stocks of inventory and then allow the local store and district leaders to tailor the additional inventory to the local market demand as it develops.Threaded fasteners accounted for approximately 90% of the fastener product line sales in 2012, 2011, and 2010 and approximately 40%, 42%, and 45% of our consolidated net sales in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.Since 1993, we have added additional product lines. These product lines are sold through the same distribution channel as the original fastener product line. Our product lines include the following: Product Line:Yearintroduced Approximatenumber of stockitemsFasteners1967 592,000Tools1993 75,000Cutting tools1996 403,000Hydraulics & pneumatics1996 111,000Material handling1996 34,000Janitorial supplies1996 23,000Electrical supplies1997 39,000Welding supplies11997 46,000Safety supplies1999 51,000Metals2001 18,000Office supplies2010 6,000Total  1,398,0001 We do not sell welding gases.Each product line listed above may contain multiple product categories.  During the last several years, we have added 'private label' brands (we sometimes refer to these as 'exclusive brands') to our offering.  These 'private label' brands currently represent approximately 10% of total sales; most of these 'private label' products are in the non-fastener product lines.We plan to continue to add other products in the future.Inventory ControlOur inventory stocking levels are determined using our computer systems, our sales personnel at the store, district, and region levels, and our product managers. The data used for this determination is derived from sales activity from all of our stores, from individual stores, and from different geographic areas. It is also derived from vendor information and from customer demographic information. The computer system monitors the inventory level for all stock items and triggers replenishment, or prompts a buyer to purchase, as necessary, based on an established minimum-maximum level. All stores stock a base inventory and may expand beyond preset inventory levels as deemed appropriate by their district managers. Inventories in distribution 8Table of Contentscenters are established from computerized data for the stores served by the respective centers. Inventory quantities are continuously re-balanced utilizing an automated transfer mechanism we call ‘inventory re-distribution’.Manufacturing and Support Services OperationsIn 2012, approximately 95% of our consolidated net sales were attributable to products manufactured by other companies to industry standards. The remaining 5% related to products manufactured, modified or repaired by our manufacturing businesses or our support services. The manufactured products consist primarily of non-standard sizes of threaded fasteners made to customers’ specifications or standard sizes manufactured under our Holo-Krome product line.  The services provided by the support services group include, but are not limited to, items such as tool repair, band saw blade welding, third-party logistics, and light manufacturing. We engage in these activities primarily as a service to our customers and expect these activities in the future to continue to contribute in the range of 4% to 10% of our consolidated net sales.Sources of SupplyWe use a large number of suppliers for the standard stock items we distribute.  Most items distributed by our network can be purchased from several sources, although preferred sourcing is used for some stock items to facilitate quality control. No single supplier accounted for more than 5% of our purchases in 2012.Geographic InformationInformation regarding our revenues and certain assets by geographic location is set forth in Note 8 of the 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements' included later in this Form 10-K under the heading ‘Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data’. Foreign currency fluctuations, changes in trade relations, or fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies could impact our ability to procure products overseas at competitive prices and our foreign sales.Customers and MarketingWe believe our success can be attributed to our ability to offer customers a full line of quality products at convenient locations, and to the superior service orientation and expertise of our employees. Most of our customers are in the manufacturing and non-residential construction markets.  The manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers and maintenance and repair operations.  The non-residential construction market includes general, electrical, plumbing, sheet metal, and road contractors.  Other users of our products include farmers, truckers, railroads, mining companies, federal, state and local governmental entities, schools, and certain retail trades. During the fourth quarter of 2012, our total number of active customer accounts (defined as accounts having purchase activity within the last 90 days) was approximately 396,000.During each of the three years ended December 31, 2012, no one customer accounted for 10% or more of our sales. We believe that our large number of customers together with the varied markets that they represent, provide some protection to us from economic downturns.Store personnel generate a significant portion of our sales through direct calls on customers. Because of the nature of our business, historically, we have made limited use of the more expensive forms of mass media advertising such as television, radio, and newspapers. The forms of advertising we typically use include signs, catalogs, and direct mailings. In recent years, we have expanded our national advertising to include a NASCAR sponsorship utilizing Fastenal Racing® (sponsoring Carl Edwards since 2010), and in 2011 we did some limited national advertising of our FAST SolutionsSM (industrial vending) through publications such as USA Today.SeasonalitySeasonality has some impact on our sales. During the winter months, our sales to customers in the non-residential construction market typically slow due to inclement weather. Also, sales to our industrial production customers may decrease during the Christmas and New Year holidays due to plant shut-downs.CompetitionOur business is highly competitive. Competitors include both large distributors located primarily in large cities and smaller distributors located in many of the same smaller markets in which we have stores. We believe the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our products are customer service, price, convenience, product availability, and cost saving solutions.Some competitors use vans to sell their products in markets away from their main warehouses, while others rely on mail order, websites, or telemarketing sales. We, however, believe that the convenience provided to customers by operating stores in small, medium, and large markets, each offering a wide variety of products, is a competitive selling advantage and that the large number of stores in a given area, taken together with our ability to provide frequent deliveries to such stores from centrally 9Table of Contentslocated distribution centers, makes possible the prompt and efficient distribution of products. We also believe our local storefront, combined with FAST SolutionsSM (industrial vending), provide a unique way to provide to our customers convenient access to products and cost saving solutions in a business model not easily replicated by our competitors. Having trained personnel at each store also enhances our ability to compete (see ‘Employees’ below).EmployeesAt year end, we employed a total of 15,145 full and part-time employees, most of whom were employed at a store location. A breakout of the number of employees, and their respective roles, is contained earlier in this document.We believe the quality of our employees is critical to our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve and to our ability to open new stores in new markets. We foster the growth and education of skilled employees throughout the organization by operating training programs and by decentralizing decision-making. Wherever possible, our goal is to ‘promote from within’. For example, most new store managers are promoted from an outside sales position and district managers (who supervise a number of stores) are usually former store managers.The Fastenal School of Business (our internal corporate university program) develops and delivers a comprehensive array of industry and company specific education and training programs that are offered to all employees. Our school of business provides core curricula focused on key competencies determined to be critical to the success of our employees’ performance. In addition, we provide specialized educational tracks within various institutes of learning. These institutes of learning are advanced levels that provide specific concentrations of education and development and have been designed to focus on the critical aspects of our business. These institutes provide a focused educational experience to enhance employee performance in relevant business areas such as leadership, effective store best practices, sales and marketing, product education, and distribution.Our sales personnel are compensated with a modest base salary and an incentive bonus arrangement that places emphasis on achieving increased sales on a store, district, and regional basis, while still attaining targeted levels of, among other things, gross profit and collections. As a result, a significant portion of our total employment cost varies with sales volume. We also pay incentive bonuses to our leadership personnel based on one or more of the following factors: sales growth, profit growth (before and after taxes), profitability, and return on assets, and to our other personnel for achieving pre-determined departmental, project, and cost containment goals.None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we have experienced no work stoppages. We believe our employee relations are good.Available InformationOur annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act are available free of charge on or through our website at www.fastenal.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports have been filed with or furnished to the SEC.10Table of ContentsITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSIn addition to the other information in this Form 10-K, the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business. Our operating results depend upon many factors and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. The material risks and uncertainties known to us which may cause the operating results to vary from anticipated results or which may negatively affect our operating results and profitability are as follows:A downturn in the economy and other factors may affect customer spending, which could harm our operating results. In general, our sales represent spending on discretionary items or consumption needs by our customers. This spending is affected by many factors, including, among others:•general business conditions,•business conditions in our principal markets,•interest rates,•inflation,•liquidity in credit markets,•taxation,•government regulations,•fuel prices and electrical power rates,•unemployment trends,•terrorist attacks and acts of war,•weather conditions, and•other matters that influence customer confidence and spending.A downturn in either the national or local economy where our stores operate or changes in any of the other factors described above could negatively impact sales at our stores and their level of profitability.This risk was demonstrated during the last several years. As the economic condition in North America weakened significantly in the fall of 2008 and into 2009, our customers, which operate principally in various manufacturing, non-residential construction, and services sectors, experienced a pronounced slowdown that adversely impacted our sales and operating results in those periods. A lag in these sectors, even as the general economy improves, could adversely impact our business.Products that we sell may expose us to potential material liability for property damage, environmental damage, personal injury or death linked to the use of those products by our customers. The products that we sell may expose us to potential claims for property damage, environmental damage, personal injury or death arising out of the use of those products by our customers.  Some of our customers operate in challenging industries where there is a material risk of catastrophic events.  If any of these events are linked to the use by our customers of any of our products, claims could be brought against us by those customers, by governmental authorities and by third parties who are injured or damaged as a result of such events.  In addition, our reputation could be adversely affected by negative publicity surrounding such events regardless of whether or not claims against us are successful.  While we maintain insurance coverage to mitigate a portion of this risk and may have recourse against our suppliers for losses arising out of defects in products procured from them, we could experience significant losses as a result of claims made against us to the extent adequate insurance is not in place, the products are manufactured by us or legal recourse against our suppliers is otherwise not available, or our insurers or suppliers are unwilling or unable to satisfy their obligations to us.Interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs and/or decreases in revenues. The proper functioning of our information systems is critical to the successful operation of our business. Although our information systems are protected with robust backup systems, including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities, information systems are still vulnerable to natural disasters, power losses, unauthorized access, telecommunication failures, and other problems. If critical information systems fail or are otherwise unavailable, our ability to process orders, maintain proper levels of inventories, collect accounts receivable, pay expenses, and maintain the security of the Company and customer data could be adversely affected. Disruptions or failures of, or security breaches with respect to, our information technology infrastructure could have a negative impact on our operations.We work hard to maintain the privacy and security of our customer and business information and the functioning of our computer systems and website. In the event of a security breach or other cyber security incident, we could experience certain operational problems or interruptions, incur substantial additional costs, or become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings, any of which could lead to damage to our reputation in the marketplace. The nature of our business requires us to receive, retain and transmit certain personally identifying information that our customers provide to purchase products or services, register on our websites, or otherwise communicate and interact with us.  While we have taken and continue to undertake significant steps to protect our customer and confidential information and the functioning of our computer systems 11Table of Contentsand website, a compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses we interact with could result in information related to our customers or business being obtained by unauthorized persons or other operational problems or interruptions. We develop and update processes and maintain systems in an effort to try to prevent this from occurring, but the development and maintenance of these processes and systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Consequently, despite our efforts, the possibility of intrusion, interruption of our business, cyber security incidents and theft cannot be eliminated entirely, and risks associated with each of these remain. While we also seek to obtain assurances that third parties we interact with will protect confidential information, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held or accessed by third parties may be compromised. If a compromise of our data security or function of our computer systems or website were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and, possibly, subject us to additional legal, regulatory and operating costs and damage our reputation in the marketplace. Our current estimate for total store market potential in North America could be incorrect. One of our primary growth strategies is to grow our business through the introduction of stores into new and existing markets. Based on a snapshot of current marketplace demographics in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, we currently estimate there is potential market opportunity in North America to support approximately 3,500 stores. We cannot guarantee that our market potential estimates are accurate or that we will open stores to reach the full market opportunity. In addition, a particular local market’s ability to support a store may change because of a change in our store format or the presence of a competitor’s store.We may be unable to meet our goals regarding new store openings. Our growth is dependent primarily on our ability to attract new customers. Historically, the most effective way to attract new customers has been opening new stores. In 2007 and 2008, our business strategy focused on opening stores at a rate of approximately 7% to 10% each year, although the economic slowdown in the latter four months of 2008 and all of 2009 caused us to adjust this rate to 2% to 5% for 2009. We opened stores at an annualized rate of 7% in the second half of 2010. We opened stores at the rate of approximately 5% and 3% in 2011 and 2012, respectively. We expect to open new stores at the rate of approximately 2.5% to 3% in 2013; however, failure to open stores at this rate could negatively impact our long-term growth.Our current business strategy 'pathway-to-profit', which involves reducing our rate of new store openings and using the money saved to add sales personnel at a faster rate, while successful over the last several years, has not yet proven successful on a long‑term basis.  In April 2007, we introduced our 'pathway to profit' strategy.  This strategy initially involved slowing our annual new store openings from our historical rate of 13% to 18% to approximately 7% to 10%.  The funds saved by opening fewer stores would be invested in additional sales personnel, with the goal of increasing our average annual per store sales, capturing earnings leverage, and increasing our pre-tax earnings.  At the time we introduced this strategy, we believed that, over the five year period from 2007 to 2012, we could grow our average store sales to $125 thousand per month and grow our pre‑tax earnings as a percent of net sales from 18% to 23%.  The economic weakness that dramatically worsened in the fall of 2008 and continued into 2009 caused us to alter this strategy during 2009 by slowing our annual new store openings to a range of approximately 2% to 5% and temporarily stopping headcount additions except at newly opened stores and stores that are growing.  Because of this economic setback, we previously indicated that the time required to achieve our pre-tax earnings percentage goals for 'pathway to profit' could be delayed 24 to 30 months.  More recently, we have indicated we believe we could hit our pre-tax earnings percentage goal with less than the $125 thousand per month figure.  We now believe the pre-tax earnings goal might be accomplished with average store sales as low as $100 to $110 thousand per month due to the structural lowering of our costs.  We believe this will shorten the extended time line for achieving our goal to 2013; however, we cannot assure this will occur.  A more prolonged downturn in the economy than expected, the prospect of future economic deterioration, changes in the rate of new store openings, difficulty in successfully attracting and retaining qualified  sales personnel, an inability to realize anticipated savings from lowering our cost structure, and failure to successfully change our selling process could further adversely impact our ability to grow average store sales, capture earnings leverage, and achieve desired pre‑tax earnings results.Changes in customer or product mix, downward pressure on sales prices, and changes in volume of orders could cause our gross margin percentage to fluctuate or decline in the future. Changes in our customer or product mix, downward pressure on sales prices, and changes in the volume of our orders could cause our gross margin percentage to fluctuate or decline. From time to time we have experienced changes in product mix. For example, marketing activities to existing customers and needs communicated to us from existing and prospective customers have caused us to change our product mix in the past. When we change our product mix, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our historical gross margins. In addition, gross margins can deteriorate if we experience downward pressure on sales prices as a result of deflation, pressures on customers to reduce costs or increased competition, as was the case in 2009. Furthermore, reductions in our volume of purchases, as also happened in 2009, can adversely impact gross margins by reducing vendor volume allowances.Opening stores in new markets presents increased risks that may prevent us from being profitable in these new locations. We intend to open stores in new markets pursuant to our growth strategy. New stores do not typically achieve operating results comparable to our existing stores until after several years of operation, and stores in new markets face additional challenges to 12Table of Contentsachieving profitability. A new store generates its sales from direct sales calls, a slow process involving repeated contacts. In new markets, we have less familiarity with local customer preferences and customers in these markets are less familiar with our name and capabilities. In addition, entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new, unfamiliar competitors. We cannot assure success in operating our stores in new markets on a profitable basis.New store openings may negatively impact our operating results. While new stores build the infrastructure for future growth, the first year sales in new stores are low, and the added expenses relating to payroll, occupancy, and transportation costs can impact our ability to leverage earnings. It has been our experience that new stores take at least ten to twelve months to achieve profitability. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in operating our new stores on a profitable basis.The ability to identify new products and product lines, and integrate them into our store and distribution network, may impact our ability to compete and our sales and margins. Our success depends in part on our ability to develop product expertise at the store level and identify future products and product lines that complement existing products and product lines and that respond to our customers’ needs. We may not be able to compete effectively unless our product selection keeps up with trends in the markets in which we compete or trends in new products. In addition, our ability to integrate new products and product lines into our stores and distribution network could impact sales and margins.Increases in energy costs and the cost of raw materials used in our products could impact our cost of goods and distribution and occupancy expenses, which may result in lower operating margins. Costs of raw materials used in our products (e.g., steel) and energy costs have fluctuated during the last several years. Increases in these costs result in increased production costs for our vendors. These vendors typically look to pass their increased costs along to us through price increases. The fuel costs of our distribution and store operations have fluctuated as well. While we typically try to pass increased vendor prices and fuel costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact, we may not be successful. Failure to fully pass any such increased prices and costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact would have an adverse effect on our operating margins.Our ability to successfully attract and retain qualified personnel to staff our stores could impact labor costs, sales at existing stores, and the rate of new store openings. Our success depends in part on our ability to attract, motivate, and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including store managers, outside sales personnel, and other store associates, who understand and appreciate our culture and are able to adequately represent this culture to our customers. Qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas, and the turnover rate in the industry is high. If we are unable to hire and retain personnel capable of consistently providing a high level of customer service, as demonstrated by their enthusiasm for our culture and product knowledge, our sales could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees. An inability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may also delay the planned openings of new stores. Any such delays, material increases in employee turnover rates at existing stores, or increases in labor costs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.Inclement weather and other disruptions to the transportation network could impact our distribution system. Our ability to provide efficient distribution of core business products to our store network is an integral component of our overall business strategy. Disruptions at distribution centers or shipping ports, due to events such as the hurricanes of 2005 and 2012 and the longshoreman’s strike on the West Coast in 2002, may affect our ability to both maintain core products in inventory and deliver products to our customers on a timely basis, which may in turn adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, severe weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our products in particularly hard hit regions.We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk, and changes in foreign exchange rates could increase our costs to procure products and our foreign sales. Because the functional currency related to most of our foreign operations is the applicable local currency, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business, such as sales to customers and purchases from suppliers denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies could impact our ability to procure products overseas at competitive prices and our foreign sales. Our primary exchange rate exposure is with the Canadian dollar.We may not be able to compete effectively against our competitors, which could harm our business and operating results. The industrial, construction, and maintenance supply industry, although consolidating, still remains a large, fragmented industry that is highly competitive. Our current or future competitors include companies with similar or greater market presence, name recognition, and financial, marketing, and other resources, and we believe they will continue to challenge us with their product selection, financial resources, and services. Increased competition in markets in which we have stores or the adoption by competitors of aggressive pricing strategies and sales methods could cause us to lose market share or reduce our prices or increase our spending, thus eroding our margins.13Table of ContentsOur revenues and net income may be adversely affected by economic conditions, political situations, and changing laws and regulations, over which we have no control. We obtain certain of our products, and our suppliers obtain certain of their products, from China, Taiwan, South Korea, Mexico, and other foreign countries. Our vendors could discontinue selling products manufactured in foreign countries at any time for reasons that may or may not be in our control or the vendor’s control, including foreign government regulations, domestic government regulations, political unrest, war, disruption or delays in shipments, changes in local economic conditions and trade issues. Our operating results and inventory levels could suffer if we are unable to promptly replace a vendor who is unwilling or unable to satisfy our requirements with a vendor providing equally appealing products.Our business may be adversely affected by political gridlock in the United States. We primarily operate in the United States.  During the last several years there has been significant fiscal uncertainty in the country the resolution of which has been impeded by political gridlock. We believe this has adversely impacted our business and could negatively impact our business in the future.Our FAST SolutionsSM (industrial vending) business is new, and our competitive advantage could be eliminated. We believe we have a competitive advantage due to our industrial vending platform (hardware and software), our local store presence, our 'vendible' product depth, and, in North America, our distribution strength.  These advantages have developed over time; however, other competitors could respond to our rapidly expanding industrial vending business with highly competitive platforms of their own.  These alternative solutions could negatively impact our ability to expand our business and/or negatively impact the economics of the industrial vending business.The industrial, construction, and maintenance supply industry is consolidating, which could cause it to become more competitive and could negatively impact our business. The industrial, construction, and maintenance supply industry in North America is consolidating. This consolidation is being driven by customer needs and supplier capabilities, which could cause the industry to become more competitive as greater economies of scale are achieved by suppliers. Customers are increasingly aware of the total costs of fulfillment and of the need to have consistent sources of supply at multiple locations. We believe these customer needs could result in fewer suppliers as the remaining suppliers become larger and capable of being a consistent source of supply.There can be no assurance that we will be able in the future to take advantage effectively of the trend toward consolidation. The trend in our industry toward consolidation could make it more difficult for us to maintain operating margins. Furthermore, as our industrial and construction customers face increased foreign competition, and potentially lose business to foreign competitors or shift their operations overseas in an effort to reduce expenses, we may face increased difficulty in growing and maintaining our market share and growth prospects.We will need to begin disclosing our use of 'conflict minerals' in certain of the products we distribute, which will impose costs on us and could raise reputational and other risks. The SEC has promulgated final rules in connection with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals, known as 'conflict minerals', that are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. These new requirements will require due diligence efforts in fiscal year 2013 and thereafter, with initial disclosure requirements effective in May 2014. There will be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including costs to determine which of our products are subject to the new rules and the source of any 'conflict minerals' used in those products. In addition, the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in those products. Also, we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to verify the origins for all metals used in products through the procedures we may implement. We may also encounter challenges to satisfy customers that may require all of the components of products purchased to be certified as conflict free. If we are not able to meet customer requirements, customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier.ITEM 1B
