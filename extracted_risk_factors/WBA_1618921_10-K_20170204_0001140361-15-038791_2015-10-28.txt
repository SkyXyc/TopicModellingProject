Item 1A.    Risk Factors

 

In addition to the other information in this report and our other filings with the SEC, you should carefully consider the risks described below, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. These risks are not the only risks that we face. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial.

 

Reductions in third party reimbursement levels, from private or governmental agency plans, and potential changes in industry pricing benchmarks for prescription drugs could adversely affect our results of operations.

 

The substantial majority of the prescriptions we fill are reimbursed by third party payers, including private and governmental agency payers. The continued efforts of health maintenance organizations, managed care organizations, pharmacy benefit management companies, governmental agencies, and other third party payers to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates, as well as litigation relating to how drugs are priced, may adversely impact our results of operations. In the United States, plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in January and our reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term. In addition, some of these entities may offer pricing terms that we may not be willing to accept or otherwise restrict our participation in their networks of pharmacy providers.

In the United States, certain provisions of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 sought to reduce federal spending by altering AMP (the Medicaid reimbursement formula for multi-source (i.e., generic) drugs). While those reductions did not go into effect, the ACA, which was signed into law on March 23, 2010, enacted a modified AMP reimbursement formula for multi-source drugs that significantly affects reimbursement calculations. The modified formula, when implemented, is expected to reduce Medicaid reimbursements, which could adversely affect our results of operations. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) is preparing to use the modified reimbursement formula to calculate a U.S. federal ceiling on reimbursement rates for multi-source drugs to pharmacies under the Medicaid program, and posts draft federal upper limit (“FUL”) reimbursement files on the CMS website that are calculated based on the requirements of the health reform legislation. As of the date of this report, these draft FUL files are for review and comment only; however, CMS has announced that it plans to publish final FULs after a period of releasing them in draft format. CMS has issued proposed regulations to implement the ACA’s provisions regarding Medicaid reimbursement to pharmacies, but to date the regulations have not been finalized. There have also been a number of other proposals and enactments by the federal government and various states to reduce Medicare Part D and Medicaid reimbursement levels in response to budget deficits, and we expect additional proposals in the future.

 

Many payers in the United States are increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates, such as average sales price, average manufacturer price, and actual acquisition cost. For example, CMS now makes national average drug acquisition cost data, which reflect retail community pharmacy invoice costs, publicly available on a regular basis. CMS has indicated that state Medicaid agencies can use this information to compare their own reimbursement and pricing methodologies and rates to those derived from the survey data. There can be no assurance that recent or future changes in prescription drug reimbursement policies and practices will not materially and adversely affect our results of operations.

 

A shift in pharmacy mix toward lower margin plans and programs could adversely affect our results of operations.

 

A shift in the mix of pharmacy prescription volume towards programs offering lower reimbursement rates could adversely affect our results of operations. Our Retail Pharmacy USA division continued to experience a shift in pharmacy mix towards 90-day at retail in fiscal 2015 and that trend is expected to continue in fiscal 2016. Our 90-day at retail offering for patients with chronic prescription needs typically is at a lower margin than comparable 30-day prescriptions. Additionally, we have accepted lower reimbursement rates in order to secure preferred relationships with Medicare Part D plans serving senior patients with significant pharmacy needs. If we are not able to generate additional prescription volume and other business from patients participating in these programs that is sufficient to offset the impact of lower reimbursement, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

 

We could be adversely affected by a decrease in the introduction of new brand name and generic prescription drugs.

 

New brand name drugs can result in increased drug utilization and associated sales revenues, while the introduction of lower priced generic alternatives typically results in relatively lower sales revenues, but higher gross profit margins. Accordingly, a decrease in the number of significant new brand name drugs or generics successfully introduced could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.

 

Generic drug inflation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the United States.

 

Overall increases in the amounts we pay to procure generic drugs, commonly referred to as generic drug inflation, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, including particularly those of our Retail Pharmacy USA division. Our gross profit margins would be adversely affected by generic inflation to the extent we are not able to offset such cost increases. We experienced a shift from historical patterns of deflation in generic drug costs to inflation in fiscal 2014, when we experienced cost increases on a subset of generic drugs that in some cases were significant. This generic inflation continued with respect to certain generic drugs in fiscal 2015. Any failure to fully offset any such increased prices and costs or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

We derive a significant portion of our sales in the United States from prescription drug sales reimbursed by pharmacy benefit management companies.

 

We derive a significant portion of our sales in the United States from prescription drug sales reimbursed through prescription drug plans administered by PBM companies. PBM companies typically administer multiple prescription drug plans that expire at various times and provide for varying reimbursement rates, and often limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication. There can be no assurance that we will continue to participate in any particular PBM company’s pharmacy provider network in any particular future time period. If our participation in the pharmacy provider network for a prescription drug plan administered by one or more of the large PBM companies is restricted or terminated, we expect that our sales would be adversely affected, at least in the short-term. If we are unable to replace any such lost sales, either through an increase in other sales or through a resumption of participation in those plans, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. If we exit a pharmacy provider network and later resume participation, there can be no assurance that we will achieve any particular level of business on any particular pace, or that all clients of the PBM company will choose to include us again in the pharmacy network for their plans, initially or at all. In addition, in such circumstances we may incur increased marketing and other costs in connection with initiatives to regain former patients and attract new patients covered by such plans.

 

Consolidation and strategic alliances in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business operations, competitive positioning, financial condition and results of operations.

 

Many organizations in the healthcare industry, including PBM companies and health insurance companies, have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power, which has resulted in greater pricing pressures. For example, in July 2015, OptumRx, UnitedHealth Group’s pharmacy care services business, completed its combination with Catamaran Corporation, with the combined businesses expected to fulfill over one billion prescriptions in 2015 and be the third largest PBM company in the United States. In addition, significant business combinations within the health insurance industry were announced in July 2015, with Anthem, Inc. announcing its agreement to acquire Cigna Corporation, and Aetna, Inc. announcing its agreement to acquire Humana Inc., with the resulting enterprises expected to be two of the three largest health insurers in the United States. If this consolidation trend continues, it could give the resulting enterprises even greater bargaining power, which may lead to further pressure on the prices for our products and services. If these pressures result in reductions in our prices, our businesses would become less profitable unless we are able to achieve corresponding reductions in costs.

 

Strategic alliances in the healthcare industry also impact our businesses and competitive positioning. For example, following the announcement of our agreement with AmerisourceBergen providing for, among other things, generic drug purchasing by Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen through WBAD, our global sourcing enterprise, some of our retail pharmacy competitors subsequently established relationships with other pharmaceutical drug wholesalers relating to generic drug procurement. In addition, further consolidation among generic drug manufacturers could lead to increased generic drug inflation in the future. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements, and other pressures will continue to cause the healthcare industry to evolve, potentially resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among the industry participants we engage with, and which may materially and adversely impact our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.


 

We may not be able to successfully or timely complete the pending acquisition of Rite Aid.




Risks and uncertainties related to our pending acquisition of Rite Aid include, among others: the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement including the failure of Rite Aid to obtain the approval of its stockholders of the transaction; that regulatory or other approvals required for the transaction are not obtained; that litigation may be filed which could prevent or delay the transaction; and that uncertainty regarding the transaction may adversely affect our and Rite Aid's relationships with suppliers, payers, customers and other third parties with which we or Rite Aid do business.




Completion of the transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, including the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods (and any extensions thereof) under the Hart-Scott- Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, approval of the transaction by Rite Aid stockholders, no material adverse effect having occurred with respect to Rite Aid prior to the closing of the transaction and other customary conditions. We will be unable to complete the pending acquisition of Rite Aid until each of the conditions to closing is either satisfied or waived. In deciding whether or not to object to the transaction, regulatory agencies have broad discretion in administering the applicable governing regulations. As a condition to their approval of the transaction, these agencies may impose requirements, limitations or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of our business after consummation of the transaction. These requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions may reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction or affect our results of operations after the closing of the transaction. Further, we can provide no assurance that we will obtain the necessary approvals or that any such conditions that are imposed would not diminish the anticipated benefits of the transaction or result in the termination of the transaction. In the event that the transaction is not completed due to the failure to obtain antitrust clearance, we could be required to pay Rite Aid a termination fee of $325 million or $650 million in certain circumstances.

 

While our acquisition of Rite Aid is pending, it creates uncertainty that may adversely affect our business and results of operations, including with respect to our relationships with suppliers, payers, customers and other third parties with which we do business. Further, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the pending transaction, as well as the diversion of management resources, for which we will receive little or no benefit if the closing of the transaction does not occur.




If we complete our pending acquisition of Rite Aid, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction which could adversely impact our results of operations.




We entered into the Merger Agreement with the expectation that the transaction will result in various benefits, including, among other things, cost savings and operating efficiencies. The achievement of the anticipated benefits of the transaction is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether Rite Aid's business can be integrated into ours in an efficient and effective manner. If the Rite Aid transaction is completed, we can provide no assurance that the anticipated benefits of the transaction, including cost savings and synergies, will be fully realized in the time frame anticipated or at all; the costs or difficulties related to the integration of Rite Aid's business and operations into ours will not be greater than expected; unanticipated costs, charges and expenses will not result from the transaction; litigation relating to the transaction will not be filed; we will be able to retain key personnel; and the transaction will not cause disruption to the parties' business and operations and relationships with employees and suppliers, payers, customers and other third parties with which we do business. If one or more of these risks are realized, it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.


 

The anticipated strategic and financial benefits of our acquisition of Alliance Boots may not be realized.

 

Walgreens and Alliance Boots entered into the Purchase and Option Agreement dated June 18, 2012, as amended on August 5, 2014 (as amended, the “Purchase and Option Agreement”), and consummated the first and second step transactions contemplated thereby, with the expectation that the transactions would result in various benefits including, among other things, procurement cost savings and operating efficiencies, revenue synergies, increased innovation, sharing of best practices, and a strengthened market position that may serve as a platform for future growth. The processes and initiatives needed to achieve these potential benefits are complex, costly, and time consuming, and we have not previously completed a transaction comparable in size or scope. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately. Achieving the expected benefits of the Alliance Boots transaction is subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties, including, without limitation, whether unique corporate cultures will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner, the coordination of geographically separate organizations, the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding potential synergies and the integration process, unforeseen expenses or delays, and competitive factors in the marketplace.

 

Prior to the Alliance Boots acquisition on December 31, 2014, Alliance Boots was a privately-held company and was not subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and other federal securities laws, and the compliance obligations of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Compliance with these new obligations as a result of Alliance Boots becoming a part of a public company has required and may continue to require significant resources and management attention, and any failure to comply could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, some current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their roles within the combined company, which may adversely affect our ability to retain or recruit key managers and other employees. We could also encounter unforeseen transaction and integration-related costs or other circumstances, such as unforeseen liabilities or other issues existing or arising with respect to the business of Alliance Boots or otherwise resulting from the transaction. Many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenue, decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention. If we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we have incurred significant transaction costs related to the acquisition and have incurred and will continue to incur integration and related costs as we integrate the Alliance Boots businesses. These integration and acquisition-related costs, including legal, accounting, financial and tax advisory and other fees and costs, may be higher than expected and some of these costs may be material.

Our operations outside of the United States subject us to a number of operating, economic, political, regulatory and other international business risks.

 

Together with our equity method investments, we had a presence in over 25 countries as of August 31, 2015. The strategic combination with Alliance Boots in December 2014 greatly increased the importance of international business to our operations, growth and prospects as, historically, substantially all of Walgreens’ business operations had been conducted within the United States and its territories. A substantial portion of Alliance Boots’ revenues are generated in the European Union and neighboring countries, and substantially all of Alliance Boots’ revenues are generated outside the United States. Our international business operations are subject to a number of risks, including:

 





·
compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including retail and wholesale pharmacy, licensing, tax, foreign trade, intellectual property, privacy and data protection, currency, political and other business restrictions and requirements and local laws and regulations, whose interpretation and enforcement vary significantly among jurisdictions and can change significantly over time;




 





·
additional U.S. and other regulation of non-domestic operations, including regulation under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws;




 





·
potential difficulties in managing foreign operations, mitigating credit risks in foreign markets, enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;




 





·
price controls imposed by foreign countries;




 





·
tariffs, duties or other restrictions on foreign currencies or trade sanctions and other trade barriers imposed by foreign countries;




 





·
potential adverse tax consequences, including tax withholding laws and policies and restrictions on repatriation of funds to the United States;




 





·
fluctuations in currency exchange rates, including uncertainty regarding the Euro;




 





·
impact of recessions and economic slowdowns in economies outside the United States, including foreign currency devaluation, higher interest rates, inflation, and increased government regulation or ownership of traditional private businesses;




 





·
the instability of foreign economies, governments and currencies and unexpected regulatory, economic or political changes in foreign markets; and




 





·
developing and emerging markets may be especially vulnerable to periods of instability and unexpected changes, and consumers in those markets may have relatively limited resources to spend on products and services.




 

These factors can also adversely affect our payers, vendors and customers in international markets, which in turn can negatively impact our businesses. We cannot assure you that one or more of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operation or financial condition.

 

Our significant operations outside of the United States also expose us to currency exchange rate fluctuations and related risks, including transaction currency exposures relating to the import and export of goods in currencies other than businesses’ functional currencies as well as currency translation exposures relating to profits and net assets denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We present our financial statements in U.S. dollars and, since the completion of the strategic combination with Alliance Boots in December 2014, have had a significant proportion of net assets and income in non-U.S. dollar currencies, primarily British Pounds Sterling and the Euro, as well as a range of emerging market currencies. Our results of operations and capital ratios can therefore be sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates. Due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future results of operations. In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations. A depreciation of non-U.S. dollar currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations.

We may from time to time, in some instances enter into foreign currency contracts or other derivative instruments intended to hedge a portion of our foreign currency fluctuation risks, which subjects us to additional risks such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations to us. Additionally, we may (and currently do) use foreign currency borrowings to hedge some of our foreign currency fluctuation risks. The periodic use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. We cannot assure you that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries, will not materially affect our consolidated financial results.

 

Our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational change and achieve cost savings initiatives.

 

In April 2015, our Board of Directors approved a plan to implement the Cost Transformation Program described in MD&A in Part II, Item 7 below as part of an initiative to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies. There can be no assurance that we will realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits of this program. Our financial goals assume a level of productivity improvement, including those reflected in our Cost Transformation Program and other business optimization initiatives. If we are unable to deliver these expected productivity improvements, while continuing to invest in business growth, our financial results could be adversely impacted. Our ability to successfully manage and execute these initiatives and realize expected savings and benefits in the amounts and at the times anticipated is important to our business success. Any failure to do so, which could result from our inability to successfully execute plans, changes in global or regional economic conditions, competition, changes in the industries in which we compete, unanticipated costs or charges, loss of key personnel and other factors described herein, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations.

 

Disruption in our global supply chain could negatively impact our businesses.

 

The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors, and any future disruption in our supply chain or inability to find qualified vendors and access products that meet requisite quality and safety standards in a timely and efficient manner could adversely impact our businesses. The loss or disruption of such supply arrangements for any reason, including for issues such as labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, inability to procure sufficient raw materials, quality control issues, ethical sourcing issues, the supplier’s financial distress, natural disasters, civil unrest or acts of war or terrorism or other external factors over which we have no control, could interrupt product supply and, if not effectively managed and remedied, have a material adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.

 

We use a single wholesaler of branded and generic pharmaceutical drugs as our primary source of such products for our Retail Pharmacy USA division.


 


On March 19, 2013, Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen announced various agreements and arrangements, including a ten-year pharmaceutical distribution agreement between Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen pursuant to which Walgreens sources branded and generic pharmaceutical products from AmerisourceBergen; an agreement which provides AmerisourceBergen the ability to access generics and related pharmaceutical products through WBAD, a global sourcing enterprise established by Walgreens and Alliance Boots; and agreements and arrangements pursuant to which we have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a minority equity position in AmerisourceBergen and gain associated representation on AmerisourceBergen’s board of directors in certain circumstances. As of the date of this report, AmerisourceBergen distributes for our Retail Pharmacy USA division all branded pharmaceutical products that Walgreens historically sourced from suppliers and distributors as well as substantially all generic pharmaceutical products that Walgreens previously self-distributed. Consequently, our business in the United States may be adversely affected by any operational, financial or regulatory difficulties that AmerisourceBergen experiences. For example, if AmerisourceBergen’s operations are seriously disrupted for any reason, whether due to a natural disaster, labor disruption, regulatory action, computer or operational systems or otherwise, it could adversely affect our business in the United States and our results of operations.

 



Our distribution agreement with AmerisourceBergen is subject to early termination in certain circumstances and, upon the expiration or termination of the agreement, there can be no assurance that we or AmerisourceBergen will be willing to renew the agreement or enter into a new agreement, on terms favorable to us or at all. If such expiration or termination occurred, we believe that alternative sources of supply for most generic and brand-name pharmaceuticals are readily available and that we could obtain and qualify alternative sources, which may include resuming self-distribution in some cases, for substantially all of the prescription drugs we sell on an acceptable basis, such that the impact of any expiration or termination would be temporary. However, there can be no assurance we would be able to engage alternative supply sources or implement self-distribution processes on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us, or effectively manage these transitions, any of which could adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.

The anticipated strategic and financial benefits of our relationship with AmerisourceBergen may not be realized.

 

Walgreens entered into the arrangement with AmerisourceBergen and Alliance Boots with the expectation that the transactions contemplated thereby would result in various benefits including, among other things, procurement cost savings and operating efficiencies, innovation and sharing of best practices. The processes and initiatives needed to achieve these potential benefits are complex, costly and time-consuming. Many of the anticipated synergies and expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time. Achieving the anticipated benefits from the arrangement is subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties, including the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations, processes or initiatives, or the inability to realize and/or delays in realizing potential benefits and synergies, whether unique corporate cultures of separate organizations will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner, unforeseen expenses or delays, and competitive factors in the marketplace.

 

In addition, we have the right, but not the obligation, under the transactions contemplated by the Framework Agreement dated as of March 18, 2013 by and among the Company, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen (the “Framework Agreement”) to invest in the equity of AmerisourceBergen. There can be no assurance that we will complete any specific level of such potential equity investments in AmerisourceBergen, or exercise our warrants to acquire AmerisourceBergen common stock when they are exercisable, or that if completed, that such investments will ultimately be profitable. If such investments are completed and the price of AmerisourceBergen common stock subsequently declines substantially, we could experience a loss on or impairment of such investment, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We could also encounter unforeseen costs, circumstances or issues existing or arising with respect to the transactions and collaboration we anticipate resulting from the Framework Agreement. Many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenue, decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention. If we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.

 

From time to time, we make investments in companies over which we do not have sole control, including our investment in AmerisourceBergen. Some of these companies may operate in sectors that differ from our current operations and have different risks.

 

From time to time, we make debt or equity investments in other companies that we may not control or over which we may not have sole control. For example, while we beneficially own approximately 5% of the outstanding common stock and have a designee serving on the board of directors of AmerisourceBergen, we do not and will not have the ability to control day-to-day operations of that company. Although the businesses in which we have made non-controlling investments often have a significant health and daily living or prescription drug component, some of them operate in businesses that are different from our primary lines of business and/or operate in different geographic markets than we do. Investments in these businesses, among other risks, subject us to the operating and financial risks of the businesses we invest in and to the risk that we do not have sole control over the operations of these businesses.

 

From time to time, we may make additional investments in or acquire other entities that may subject us to similar risks. The completion of the Second Step Transaction increased our and our stockholders’ effective interest in certain equity method investments and other investments of Alliance Boots over which Alliance Boots does not exercise control. We rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of these entities and their failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may materially and adversely affect us. Investments in entities over which we do not have sole control, including joint ventures and strategic alliances, present additional risks such as having differing objectives from our partners or the entities in which we are invested, becoming involved in disputes, or competing with those persons.

 

Changes in economic conditions could adversely affect consumer buying practices.

 

Our performance has been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted by changes in global, national, regional or local economic conditions and consumer confidence. These conditions can also adversely affect our key vendors and customers. External factors that affect consumer confidence and over which we exercise no influence include unemployment rates, levels of personal disposable income, and global, national, regional or local economic conditions, as well as acts of war or terrorism. Changes in economic conditions and consumer confidence could adversely affect consumer preferences, purchasing power and spending patterns, which could lead to a decrease in overall consumer spending. In addition, reduced or flat consumer spending may drive us and our competitors to offer additional products at promotional prices. All of these factors could materially and adversely impact our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.

European economic conditions together with austerity measures being taken by certain European governments could adversely affect us.

 

The acquisition of Alliance Boots significantly increased our assets and operations within Europe and, accordingly, our exposure to economic conditions in Europe. A further slowdown within the European economy could affect our businesses in Europe by reducing the prices our customers may be able or willing to pay for our products and services or by reducing the demand for our products and services, either of which could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, in many European countries, the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility, and reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system. In recent years, in response to the economic environment and financial crisis in Europe, a number of European governments have announced or implemented austerity measures to reduce healthcare spending and constrain overall government expenditures. These measures, which include efforts aimed at reforming healthcare coverage and reducing healthcare costs, continue to exert pressure on the pricing of and reimbursement timelines for pharmaceutical drugs. Countries with existing austerity measures may impose additional laws, regulations, or requirements on the healthcare industry. In addition, European governments that have not yet imposed austerity measures may impose them in the future. Any new austerity measures may be similar to or vary in scope and nature from existing austerity measures and could have a material adverse effect on our international business operations and results of operations.

 

The industries in which we operate are highly competitive.

 

The level of competition among retail pharmacies and pharmaceutical wholesalers is high. Changes in market dynamics or actions of competitors or manufacturers, including industry consolidation and the emergence of new competitors, could materially and adversely impact us. Our retail pharmacy businesses face intense competition from local, regional, national and global companies, including other drugstore and pharmacy chains, independent drugstores and pharmacies, mail-order prescription providers and various other retailers such as grocery stores, convenience stores, mass merchants, online and omni-channel pharmacies and retailers, warehouse clubs, dollar stores and other discount merchandisers, some of which are aggressively expanding in markets we serve. Businesses in our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division face intense competition from direct competitors, including national and regional cooperative wholesalers, and alternative supply sources such as importers and manufacturers who supply directly to pharmacies. Competition may also come from other sources in the future. As competition increases in the markets in which we operate, a significant increase in general pricing pressures could occur, which could require us to reevaluate our pricing structures to remain competitive. For example, if we are not able to anticipate and successfully respond to changes in market conditions in our pharmaceutical wholesale division, including changes driven by competitors, suppliers or manufacturers, it could result in a loss of customers or renewal of contracts or arrangements on less favorable terms. Any failure to anticipate and timely and appropriately respond to evolving market conditions could result in decreased revenue and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

 

If the merchandise and services that we offer fail to meet customer needs, our sales may be adversely affected.

 

We could be adversely affected by changes in consumer spending levels and shopping habits and preferences, including attitudes towards our retail and product brands. The success of our retail pharmacy businesses depends on our ability to offer a superior shopping experience, a quality assortment of available merchandise, and superior customer service. We must identify, obtain supplies of, and offer to our customers attractive, innovative and high-quality merchandise on a continuous basis. Our products and services must satisfy the needs and desires of our customers, whose preferences may change in the future. It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand. If we misjudge either the demand for products and services we sell or our customers’ purchasing habits and tastes, we may be faced with excess inventories of some products and missed opportunities for products and services we chose not to offer. In addition, our sales may decline or we may be required to sell the merchandise we have obtained at lower prices. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our customers and the demand for our products and services, which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations.

Our private brand offerings expose us to various additional risks.

 

In addition to brand name products, we offer our customers private brand products that are not available from other retailers. We seek to continue to grow our exclusive private brand offerings as part of our growth strategy, including through the expanded offering of Boots No7 and other brands owned or licensed on an exclusive basis, as well as through selective acquisitions. Maintaining consistent product quality, competitive pricing, and availability of our private brand offerings for our customers is important in differentiating us from other retailers and developing and maintaining customer loyalty. Although we believe that our private brand products offer value to our customers and typically provide us with higher gross margins than comparable national brand products we sell, the expansion of our private brand offerings also subjects us to additional risks, such as potential product liability risks and mandatory or voluntary product recalls; our ability to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties; our ability to successfully administer and comply with applicable contractual obligations and regulatory requirements; and other risks generally encountered by entities that source, sell and market exclusive branded offerings for retail. An increase in sales of our private brands may also adversely affect sales of our vendors’ products, which, in turn, could adversely affect our relationship with certain of our vendors. Any failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operations and financial condition.

 

If we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omni-channel experience for our customers, our businesses and results of operations could be adversely impacted.

 

Our business has evolved from an in-store experience to interaction with customers across numerous channels, including in-store, online, mobile and social media, among others. Omni-channel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing customer expectations and new developments by our competitors. Our customers are increasingly using computers, tablets, mobile phones, and other devices to comparison shop, determine product availability and complete purchases online. We must compete by offering a consistent and convenient shopping experience for our customers regardless of the ultimate sales channel and by investing in, providing and maintaining digital tools for our customers that have the right features and are reliable and easy to use. If we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant customer-facing technology in a timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if our online activities or our other customer-facing technology systems do not function as designed, we may experience a loss of customer confidence, data security breaches, lost sales, or be exposed to fraudulent purchases, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, reputation and results of operations.

 

We may be constrained if we are unable to find suitable new store locations at acceptable prices or by the terms of our current leases.

 

Our ability to grow our retail pharmacy businesses may be constrained if suitable new store locations cannot be identified with lease terms or purchase prices that are acceptable to us. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores. Local land use and other regulations applicable to the types of stores we desire to construct may impact our ability to find suitable locations and influence the cost of constructing our stores. The termination or expiration of leases at existing store locations may adversely affect us if the renewal terms of those leases are unacceptable to us and we are forced to close or relocate stores. Further, changing local demographics at existing store locations may adversely affect revenue and profitability levels at those stores.

 

We may experience a significant disruption in our computer systems.

 

We rely extensively on our computer systems to manage our ordering, pricing, point-of-sale, pharmacy fulfillment, inventory replenishment, customer loyalty programs, finance and other processes. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, vandalism, natural disasters, catastrophic events and human error, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. If any of our systems are damaged, fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and may experience loss or corruption of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our businesses and results of operations. In addition, we are currently making, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in our information technology systems and infrastructure, some of which are significant. Upgrades involve replacing existing systems with successor systems, making changes to existing systems, or cost-effectively acquiring new systems with new functionality. Implementing new systems carries significant potential risks, including failure to operate as designed, potential loss or corruption of data or information, cost overruns, implementation delays, disruption of operations, and the potential inability to meet business and reporting requirements. While we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems and believe we are taking reasonable action to mitigate known risks, there can be no assurance that these technology initiatives will be deployed as planned or that they will be timely implemented without disruption to our operations. We also could be adversely affected by any significant disruption in the systems of key payers or vendors.

If we do not maintain the privacy and security of sensitive customer and business information, we could damage our reputation, suffer a loss of revenue, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation.

 

The protection of customer, employee, and company data is critical to our businesses. Cybersecurity and other information technology security risks, such as a significant breach of customer, employee, or company data, could attract a substantial amount of media attention, damage our customer relationships and reputation, and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits. Throughout our operations, we receive, retain and transmit certain personal information that our customers and others provide to purchase products or services, fill prescriptions, enroll in promotional programs, participate in our customer loyalty programs, register on our websites, or otherwise communicate and interact with us. In addition, aspects of our operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Although we deploy a layered approach to address information security threats and vulnerabilities designed to protect confidential information against data security breaches, a compromise of our data security systems or of those of businesses with whom we interact, which results in confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged or used by unauthorized or improper persons, could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions and claims from customers, financial institutions, payment card associations and other persons, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend substantial additional resources related to the security of information systems and disrupt our businesses.

 

The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements across businesses. We are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data privacy regulations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate that regulate the collection, use and transfer of personal data, including the transfer of personal data between or among countries. Some foreign data privacy regulations are more stringent than those in the United States. We may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations. Compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes. If we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a data security breach, our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to additional litigation and regulatory risks. Our security measures may be undermined due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and personal information. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and potentially have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.

 


We are subject to payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business operations.

 

We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, Apple Pay™ and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time. Acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. These requirements and related interpretations may change over time, which could make compliance more difficult or costly. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which could increase over time and raise our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment. If these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could disrupt our business. The payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by persons who seek to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems. If we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements, or if data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data relating to our payment systems, we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments could be impaired. In addition, our reputation could suffer and our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which could result in higher costs and/or reduced sales and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.

Our growth strategy is partially dependent upon acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic investments, some of which may not prove to be successful.

 

We have grown, in part, through acquisitions in recent years and expect to continue to acquire or invest in businesses that build on or are deemed complementary to our existing businesses or further our growth strategies. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies, distraction of management from overseeing, and disruption of, our existing operations, difficulties in entering markets or lines of business in which we have no or limited direct prior experience, the possible loss of key employees and customers, and difficulties in achieving the synergies we anticipated. Any failure to select suitable acquisitions at fair prices, conduct appropriate due diligence and successfully integrate the acquired company, including particularly when acquired businesses operate in new geographic markets or areas of business, could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. These transactions may also cause us to significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition or investment, issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders’ percentage ownership, or incur asset write-offs and restructuring costs and other related expenses.

 

Acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments involve numerous other risks, including potential exposure to unknown liabilities, as well as undetected internal control, regulatory or other issues, or additional costs not anticipated at the time the transaction was completed. No assurance can be given that our acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic investments will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operations, financial condition or results of operations.

 

Changes in healthcare regulatory environments may adversely affect our businesses.

 

Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to significant changes that could adversely affect our results of operations. In recent years, the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending. These changes include an increased reliance on managed care; cuts in certain Medicare and Medicaid funding in the United States and the funding of governmental payers in foreign jurisdictions; consolidation of competitors, suppliers and other market participants; and the development of large, sophisticated purchasing groups. We expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future. Some of these potential changes, such as a reduction in governmental funding at the state or federal level for certain healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing, healthcare services or mandated benefits, may cause customers to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services. We expect continued governmental and private payer pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing. Changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers’ pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our profitability.

 

The ACA was enacted in 2010 to provide health insurance coverage to millions of previously uninsured Americans through a combination of insurance market reforms, an expansion of Medicaid, subsidies and health insurance mandates. While certain provisions of the ACA have already taken effect, others have delayed effective dates or require further rulemaking action or regulatory guidance by governmental agencies to implement and/or finalize. As a result, there remains considerable uncertainty as to the full impact of ACA on our business operations. Future rulemaking or other regulatory actions under the ACA or otherwise could increase regulation of pharmacy services, result in changes to pharmacy reimbursement rates, and otherwise change the way we do business. We cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking or other regulatory actions, but any such actions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

 

A significant change in, or noncompliance with, governmental regulations and other legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and profitability.

 

We operate in a complex, highly regulated environment in the United States and in the other countries in which we operate and could be adversely affected by changes to existing legal requirements, new legal requirements and/or any failure to comply with applicable regulations. Businesses in our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division are subject to a range of regulations relating to such things as product margins, product traceability and the conditions under which products must be stored. Our retail pharmacy and health and wellness services businesses are subject to numerous country, state and local regulations including licensing and other requirements for pharmacies and reimbursement arrangements. The regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: country, and state registration and regulation of pharmacies; dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine; applicable governmental payer regulations including Medicare and Medicaid; data privacy and security laws and regulations including HIPAA; the ACA; laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances; regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), trade regulations including those of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and consumer protection and safety regulations including those of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as state regulatory authorities, governing the availability, sale, advertisement and promotion of products we sell; anti-kickback laws; false claims laws; laws against the corporate practice of medicine; and foreign, national and state laws governing the practice of the profession of pharmacy. For example, in the United States the DEA, FDA and various other regulatory authorities regulate the distribution and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. We are required to hold valid DEA and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the Controlled Substance Act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale, dispensing, disposal, holding and distribution of controlled substances. The DEA, FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations. We are also governed by foreign, national and state laws of general applicability, including laws regulating matters of working conditions, health and safety and equal employment opportunity. In addition, we could have significant exposure if we are found to have infringed another party’s intellectual property rights.

Changes in laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations may alter the landscape in which we do business and may affect our costs of doing business. The impact of new laws, regulations and policies generally cannot be predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs and require significant capital expenditures. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses, including:  suspension of payments from government programs; loss of required government certifications; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the United States; loss of licenses; and significant fines or monetary penalties. Any failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the United States or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.

 

We could be adversely affected by product liability, product recall or personal injury issues.

 

We could be adversely impacted by the supply of defective products, including the infiltration of counterfeit products into the supply chain, errors in re-labelling of products, product tampering, product recall and contamination or product mishandling issues. Through our pharmacies, we are also exposed to risks relating to the services we provide. Errors in the dispensing and packaging of pharmaceuticals could lead to serious injury or death. Product liability or personal injury claims may be asserted against us with respect to any of the products or pharmaceuticals we sell or services we provide. Our healthcare clinics also increase our exposure to professional liability claims related to medical care. Should a product or other liability issue arise, the coverage limits under our insurance programs and the indemnification amounts available to us may not be adequate to protect us against claims. We also may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future. Damage to our reputation in the event of a product liability or personal injury issue or judgment against us or a product recall could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.

 

We have significant outstanding debt; our debt and associated payment obligations could significantly increase in the future if we incur additional debt and do not retire existing debt.

 

We have outstanding debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity. As of August 31, 2015, we had approximately $14.4 billion of outstanding indebtedness, including short-term borrowings. Our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including:

 





·
requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and other amounts payable on our debt, which would reduce the funds we have available for other purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends;




 





·
making it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, debt refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes;




 





·
reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our industry and market conditions;




 





·
making us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business operations; and




 





·
exposing us to interest rate risk given that a portion of our debt obligations is at variable interest rates.

We may incur or assume significantly more debt in the future, including in connection with acquisitions, strategic investments or joint ventures. For example, we incurred significant additional debt in connection with the Second Step Transaction. Further, we intend to finance our pending acquisition of Rite Aid through a combination of cash on hand and debt financing. We have entered into a bridge facility commitment letter and expect to obtain permanent financing to replace such bridge facility prior to the closing of the transaction, but cannot guarantee that we will obtain such permanent financing on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. See “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 below and Note 21, Subsequent Event, to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 below. If we add new debt and do not retire existing debt, the risks described above could increase. We also could be adversely impacted by any failure to renew or replace, on terms acceptable to us or at all, existing funding arrangements when they expire, and any failure to satisfy applicable covenants.

 

Our long-term debt obligations include covenants that may adversely affect our ability, and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries, to incur certain secured indebtedness or engage in certain types of transactions. In addition, our existing credit agreements require us to maintain as of the last day of each fiscal quarter a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization not to exceed a certain level. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. If we breach any of these restrictions or covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable. This could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition.

 

Our credit ratings and ability to access well-functioning capital markets are important to us.





Historically, we have relied on the public debt capital markets to fund portions of our capital investments and access to the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities as part of our working capital management strategy. Our continued access to these markets, and the terms of such access, depend on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance, and our credit ratings. The major credit rating agencies have assigned us and our corporate debt investment grade credit ratings. These ratings are based on a number of factors, which include their assessment of our financial strength and financial policies. We aim to maintain investment grade ratings as they serve to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate our access to a variety of lenders and other creditors, including landlords for our leased stores, on terms that we consider advantageous to our businesses. However, there can be no assurance that any particular rating assigned to us will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency, if in that rating agency's judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant. Incurrence of additional debt by us, including, if the pending acquisition of Rite Aid is completed, outstanding Rite Aid indebtedness we acquire upon closing and any additional debt we issue in connection with the financing of the transaction, could adversely affect our credit ratings. Any disruptions or turmoil in the capital markets or any downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition, and results of operations.


 

As a holding company, Walgreens Boots Alliance is dependent on funding from its operating subsidiaries to pay dividends and other obligations.

 

Walgreens Boots Alliance is a holding company with no business operations of its own. Its only significant asset is the outstanding capital stock of its subsidiaries. As a result, it is dependent on funding from its subsidiaries, including Walgreens and Alliance Boots, to meet its obligations. Additionally, Walgreens Boots Alliance’s subsidiaries may be restricted in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions to Walgreens Boots Alliance, which may limit the payment of cash dividends or other distributions to the holders of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock. Credit facilities and other debt obligations of Walgreens Boots Alliance, as well as statutory provisions, may further limit the ability of Walgreens Boots Alliance and its subsidiaries to pay dividends.

 

Our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly.

 

Our operating results have historically varied on a quarterly basis and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future. Factors that may affect our quarterly operating results, some of which are beyond the control of management, include, but are not limited to, seasonality; the timing of the introduction of new generic and brand name prescription drugs; inflation, including with respect to generic drug procurement costs; the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season; changes in payer reimbursement rates and terms; fluctuations in inventory, energy, transportation, labor, healthcare and other costs; significant acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and other strategic initiatives; asset impairments; the relative magnitude of our LIFO provision in any particular quarter; fluctuations in the value of our warrants to acquire AmerisourceBergen common stock; foreign currency fluctuations; prolonged severe weather in key markets; and many of the other risk factors discussed herein. Accordingly, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and investors should not rely on the results of any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance.

Our businesses are seasonal in nature, and adverse events during the holiday and cough, cold and flu seasons could adversely impact our operating results.

 

Our businesses are seasonal in nature, with the second fiscal quarter (December, January and February) typically generating a higher proportion of retail sales and earnings than other fiscal quarters. We purchase significant amounts of seasonal inventory in anticipation of the holiday season. Adverse events, such as deteriorating economic conditions, higher unemployment, higher gas prices, public transportation disruptions, or unanticipated adverse weather, could result in lower-than-planned sales during key selling seasons. For example, frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms, windstorms or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and increase our snow removal and other costs. This could lead to lower sales or to unanticipated markdowns, negatively impacting our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, both prescription and non-prescription drug sales are affected by the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season, which can vary considerably from year to year.

 

We could be adversely impacted by changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters.

 

Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our businesses, including, but not limited to, revenue recognition, asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, inventories, vendor rebates and other vendor consideration, lease obligations, self-insurance liabilities, tax matters, unclaimed property laws and litigation and other contingent liabilities are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. For example, changes in accounting standards and the application of existing accounting standards particularly related to the measurement of fair value as compared to carrying value for the Company’s reporting units, including goodwill, intangible assets and investments in equity interests, including investments held by our equity method investees, may have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include significant adverse changes in the business climate and declines in the financial condition of a reporting unit. Factors that could lead to impairment of investments in equity interests of the companies in which we invested or the investments held by those companies include a prolonged period of decline in their operating performance or adverse changes in the economic, regulatory and legal environments of the countries they operate in. New accounting guidance also may require systems and other changes that could increase our operating costs and/or change our financial statements. For example, implementing future accounting guidance related to leases, revenue and other areas impacted by the current convergence project between the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the International Accounting Standards Board could require us to make significant changes to our lease management system or other accounting systems, and could result in adverse changes to our financial statements.

 

We have a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets which could, in the future, become impaired and result in material non-cash charges to our results of operations.

 

As of August 31, 2015, we had $28.7 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets (based on the preliminary purchase accounting for the Alliance Boots acquisition), a significant increase over the $3.5 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets we had as of August 31, 2014. We accounted for the Second Step Transaction using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with GAAP, with the purchase price paid allocated to recognize the acquired assets and liabilities at their fair value. At least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment in the carrying value as defined by GAAP, we will evaluate this goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount. Estimated fair values could change if, for example, there are changes in the business climate, unanticipated changes in the competitive environment, adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments, changes in capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital expenditure levels, operating cash flows, or market capitalization. Because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets, any future impairment of these assets could require material non-cash charges to our results of operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

 

We are exposed to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings.

 

We operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment. We are involved in legal proceedings and subject to investigations, inspections, audits, inquiries and similar actions by governmental authorities arising in the course of our businesses, including those contained in Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Legal proceedings, in general, and securities and class action litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. From time to time, we are also involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving antitrust, tax, contract, intellectual property and other matters. We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies, and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial, regardless of the outcome. Substantial unanticipated verdicts, fines and rulings do sometimes occur. As a result, we could from time to time incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could negatively affect our operations. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources.

We could be adversely affected by violations of anti-bribery, anti-corruption and/or international trade laws.

 

We are subject to laws concerning our business operations and marketing activities in foreign countries where we conduct business. For example, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”), U.S. export control and trade sanction laws, and similar anti-corruption and international trade laws in certain foreign countries, such as the U.K. Bribery Act, any violation of which could create substantial liability for us and also harm our reputation. The FCPA generally prohibits U.S. companies and their officers, directors, employees, and intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. The FCPA also requires that U.S. public companies maintain books and records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. If we are found to have violated the FCPA, or any other anti-bribery, anti-corruption or international trade laws, we may face sanctions including civil and criminal fines, disgorgement of profits, and suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with governmental agencies or receive export licenses. In addition, new initiatives may be proposed from time to time that impact the trading conditions in certain countries or regions, and may include retaliatory duties or trade sanctions which, if enacted, could adversely impact our trading relationships with vendors or other parties in such locations and have a material adverse effect on our operations. From time to time, we may face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign governmental agencies relating to our international business activities, compliance with which could be costly and time-consuming, and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. An adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition, and results of operations.

 

We could be subject to adverse changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions.

 

We are a large corporation with operations in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions around the world. As such, we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and local governments as well as various foreign jurisdictions. We compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. As the tax rates vary among jurisdictions, a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision. From time to time, legislative initiatives are proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions, effective tax rate, tax payments or financial condition. In addition, tax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations. Any change in enacted tax laws, rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations, any adverse outcome in connection with tax audits in any jurisdiction or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments and results of operations.

 

Our insurance programs may expose us to unexpected costs.

 

We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liability for workers’ compensation; automobile and general liability; property, director and officers’ liability; and employee healthcare benefits. Provisions for losses related to self-insured risks generally are based upon actuarially determined estimates. Any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability. Changes in legal claims, trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, insolvency of insurance carriers, and changes in discount rates could all materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

 

We could be adversely impacted by changes in assumptions used in calculating pension assets and liabilities.

 

We operate certain defined benefit pension plans in the United Kingdom, which were closed to new entrants in 2010. The valuation of the pension plan’s assets and liabilities depends in part on assumptions, which are primarily based on the financial markets as well as longevity and employee retention rates. This valuation is particularly sensitive to material changes in the value of equity, bond and other investments held by the pension plans, changes in the corporate bond yields which are used in the measurement of the liabilities, changes in market expectations for long-term price inflation, and new evidence on projected longevity rates. Funding requirements and the impact on the statement of earnings relating to these pension plans are also influenced by these factors. Adverse changes in the assumptions used to calculate the value of pension assets and liabilities, including lower than expected pension fund investment returns and/or increased life expectancy of plan participants, or regulatory change could require us to increase the funding of its defined benefit pension plans or incur higher expenses, which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.

Certain stockholders may have significant voting influence over matters requiring stockholder approval.

 

As of August 31, 2015, affiliates of Stefano Pessina, our Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (the “SP Investors”), and affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. (“KKR”, and together with certain of its affiliates, the “KKR Investors”) together had sole or shared voting power, directly or indirectly, over an aggregate of approximately 20.2% of our outstanding common stock, based on filings by such persons with the SEC. This total includes the approximately 12.8% of our outstanding common stock (as of August 31, 2015) held by Sprint Acquisitions Holdings Limited (f/k/a AB Acquisitions Holdings Limited) (“Sprint Acquisitions”), which is jointly controlled by Mr. Pessina (indirectly through controlled entities) and the KKR Investors, which could be distributed to the various shareholders of Sprint Acquisitions (including the SP Investors and the KKR Investors) in fiscal 2016 as described below. The SP Investors and the KKR Investors have agreed to, for so long as the SP Investors and the KKR Investors (as applicable) have the right to designate a nominee for election to the Board, to vote all of their shares of common stock in accordance with the Board’s recommendation on matters submitted to a vote of the Company’s stockholders (including with respect to the election of directors). Whether or not subject to these voting provisions, the SP Investors’ and/or the KKR Investors’ significant interest in our common stock potentially could determine the outcome of matters submitted to a vote by our stockholders. The influence of the SP Investors and/or the KKR Investors could result in our taking actions that other stockholders do not support or failing to take actions that other stockholders support. As a result, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.

 

Shares issued to Alliance Boots stockholders in connection with our strategic combination with Alliance Boots are or soon will be eligible for future sale.

 

In connection with our strategic combination with Alliance Boots, we issued a total of approximately 227.7 million shares of our common stock to former Alliance Boots shareholders. These shares represented approximately 20.9% of our outstanding shares as of August 31, 2015. We also entered into, on August 2, 2012, a shareholders agreement (the “Company Shareholders Agreement”) with certain of the SP Investors and the KKR Investors that imposed certain contractual restrictions that generally prohibited them from transferring these shares of our common stock for specified time periods. These transfer restrictions have now lapsed. However, unless the SP Investors and the KKR Investors have elected to put certain guarantees in place, the Purchase and Option Agreement prohibits Sprint Acquisitions from distributing more than 10% of the shares of our common stock it received on completion of the Second Step Transaction to its investors until December 31, 2015. Accordingly, subject to these provisions of the Purchase and Option Agreement and certain obligations pursuant to the Company Shareholders Agreement, these shares may now be sold pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), depending on the holding period and subject to restrictions in the case of shares held by persons deemed to be our affiliates. The Company Shareholders Agreement also contains registration rights that would obligate us, in certain instances, to file future registration statements under the Securities Act covering resales of these shares or to permit a “piggyback” on a future registration statement. A sale, or the perception that a sale may occur, of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could adversely impact the market price of our common stock.

 

Conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also owners or directors of our largest stockholder.

 

As of August 31, 2015, Sprint Acquisitions was the holder of approximately 12.8% of our outstanding common stock. Sprint Acquisitions is jointly controlled by Stefano Pessina (indirectly through controlled entities) and the KKR Investors. Mr. Pessina is our Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Dominic Murphy is both a partner of KKR and one of our directors. Additionally, each of Marco Pagni, our Executive Vice President, Global Chief Legal and Administrative Officer, and Ornella Barra, our Executive Vice President, President and Chief Executive, Global Wholesale and International Retail, serves as a director of Sprint Acquisitions and/or its affiliates. This overlap could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest, when our interests diverge with those of Sprint Acquisitions and/or its affiliates. For example, potential conflicts of interest could arise if a dispute were to arise between the Company and Sprint Acquisitions in connection with indemnification or other provisions of the Purchase and Option Agreement or the Company Shareholders Agreement. Potential conflicts of interest could also arise in connection with any current or future arrangements between the Company and Sprint Acquisitions or any of their respective affiliates. While our contractual arrangements place restrictions on the parties’ conduct in certain situations, and related party transactions are subject to independent review and approval in accordance with our related party transaction approval procedures and applicable law, the potential for a conflict of interest exists and such persons may have conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, with respect to matters involving or affecting both companies.

Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, Delaware law and/or our agreements with certain stockholders may impede the ability of our stockholders to make changes to our Board or impede a takeover.

 

Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), could make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the Board or discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, consolidation, or acquisitions that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable. These provisions include the authorization of the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that could be issued by the Board, limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings, and advance notice requirements for nomination for election to the Board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. We are also subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, which prohibits us, except under specified circumstances, from engaging in any mergers, significant sales of stock or assets, or business combinations with any stockholder or group of stockholders who own 15% or more of our common stock.

 

Under the Company Shareholders Agreement, each of the SP Investors and the KKR Investors, respectively, is entitled to designate one nominee to the Board (currently Stefano Pessina for the SP Investors and Dominic Murphy for the KKR Investors) for so long as the SP Investors and the KKR Investors, respectively, continue to meet certain beneficial ownership thresholds and subject to certain other conditions. Pursuant to the Company Shareholders Agreement, the SP Investors and the KKR Investors have agreed that, for so long as each has the right to designate a nominee to the Board, they will vote all of their shares of common stock in accordance with the Board’s recommendation on matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders (including with respect to the election of directors).

 

In addition, pursuant to an agreement (the “Nomination and Support Agreement”) with JANA Partners LLC (“JANA”) whereby, among other things, Barry Rosenstein of JANA was appointed to the Board, JANA and its affiliates and controlled associates are subject to certain standstill restrictions until the date that is 15 days after Mr. Rosenstein is no longer a member of the Board (subject to certain conditions and limitations). These standstill restrictions include, among other things, that JANA and its affiliates and controlled associates will vote their shares in favor of all incumbent directors nominated by the Board and in accordance with the recommendations of the Board on other matters, other than certain matters specified in the Nomination and Support Agreement.

 

While these provisions do not make us immune from takeovers or changes in the composition of the Board, and are intended to protect our stockholders from, among other things, coercive or otherwise unfair tactics, these provisions could have the effect of making it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the Board or discouraging, delaying, or preventing a merger, consolidation, or acquisitions that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable. See also the risk factor captioned “Certain stockholders may have significant voting influence over matters requiring stockholder approval” above.

 

The market price of our common stock may be volatile.

 

The market price of shares of our common stock may be volatile. Broad general economic, political, market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of the shares, regardless of our actual operating performance.

·
actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results and the results of competitors;




 





·
changes in financial estimates by Walgreens Boots Alliance or by any securities analysts that might cover Walgreens Boots Alliance;




 





·
conditions or trends in the industry, including regulatory changes or changes in the securities marketplace;

·
announcements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us;




 





·

There are a number of additional business risks that could adversely affect our businesses and financial results.

 

Many other factors could adversely affect our businesses and financial results, including:

 





·
If we are unsuccessful in establishing effective advertising, marketing and promotional programs, our sales or sales margins could be negatively affected.




 





·
Our operating costs may be subject to increases outside the control of our businesses, whether due to inflation, new or increased taxes, adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in market conditions or otherwise.




 





·
Our success depends on our continued ability to attract and retain store and management and professional personnel, and the loss of key personnel could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations, financial condition or cash flow.




 





·
Natural disasters, civil unrest, severe weather conditions, terrorist activities, global political and economic developments, war, health epidemics or pandemics or the prospect of these events can impact our operations or damage our facilities in affected areas or have an adverse impact on consumer confidence levels and spending on our products and services.




 





·
The long-term effects of climate change on general economic conditions and the pharmacy industry in particular are unclear, and changes in the supply, demand or available sources of energy and the regulatory and other costs associated with energy production and delivery may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our businesses.




 





·
If negative publicity, even if unwarranted, related to safety or quality, human and workplace rights, or other issues damage our brand image and corporate reputation, or that of our vendors or strategic allies, our businesses may suffer.
