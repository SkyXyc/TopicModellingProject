 of this Form 10-K.EMPLOYEESThe Company had approximately 5,800 employees at December 31, 2015.REGULATORY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERSEnvironmental and Occupational Health and Safety RegulationsAnadarko’s business operations are subject to numerous international, provincial, federal, regional, state, tribal, local, and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. The more significant of these existing environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations include the following U.S. laws and regulations, as amended from time to time: •the U.S. Clean Air Act, which restricts the emission of air pollutants from many sources, imposes various pre-construction, monitoring, and reporting requirements, which the Environmental Protection Agency has relied upon as authority for adopting climate change regulatory initiatives•the U.S. Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the federal Clean Water Act (CWA), which regulates discharges of pollutants from facilities to state and federal waters and establishes the extent to which waterways are subject to federal jurisdiction and rulemaking as protected waters of the United States•the U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), which subjects owners and operators of vessels, onshore facilities, and pipelines, as well as lessees or permittees of areas in which offshore facilities are located, to liability for removal costs and damages arising from an oil spill in waters of the United States•U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and natural-gas operations in U.S. waters and impose obligations for establishing financial assurances for decommissioning activities, liabilities for pollution cleanup costs resulting from operations, and potential liabilities for pollution damages•the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, which imposes liability on generators, transporters, and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur23Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•the U.S. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which governs the generation, treatment, storage, transport, and disposal of solid wastes, including hazardous wastes•the U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act, which ensures the quality of the nation’s public drinking water through adoption of drinking water standards and controlling the injection of waste fluids into below-ground formations that may adversely affect drinking water sources•the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, which requires facilities to implement a safety hazard communication program and disseminate information to employees, local emergency planning committees, and response departments on toxic chemical uses and inventories•the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act, which establishes workplace standards for the protection of the health and safety of employees, including the implementation of hazard communications programs designed to inform employees about hazardous substances in the workplace, potential harmful effects of these substances, and appropriate control measures•the Endangered Species Act, which restricts activities that may affect federally identified endangered and threatened species or their habitats through the implementation of operating restrictions or a temporary, seasonal, or permanent ban in affected areas•the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies, including the Department of the Interior, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to impact the environment and that may require the preparation of environmental assessments and more detailed environmental impact statements that may be made available for public review and commentThese U.S. laws and regulations, as well as state counterparts, generally restrict the level of pollutants emitted to ambient air, discharges to surface water, and disposals or other releases to surface and below-ground soils and ground water. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil, and criminal penalties; the imposition of investigatory, remedial, and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures; the occurrence of delays in the permitting, development or expansion of projects; and the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting some or all of the Company’s activities in a particular area. See Risk Factors under .  Risk FactorsCAUTIONARY STATEMENT ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSUnless the context otherwise requires, the terms “Anadarko” and “Company” refer to Anadarko Petroleum Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. The Company has made in this Form 10-K, and may from time to time make in other public filings, press releases, and management discussions, forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, concerning the Company’s operations, economic performance, and financial condition. These forward-looking statements include, among other things, information concerning future production and reserves, schedules, plans, timing of development, contributions from oil and gas properties, marketing and midstream activities, and also include those statements preceded by, followed by, or that otherwise include the words “may,” “could,” “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “estimates,” “projects,” “target,” “goal,” “plans,” “objective,” “should,” “would,” “will,” “potential,” “continue,” “forecast,” “future,” “likely,” “outlook,” or similar expressions or variations on such expressions. For such statements, the Company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will be realized. Anadarko undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.These forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainties. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company’s expectations include, but are not limited to, the following risks and uncertainties: •the Company’s assumptions about energy markets•production and sales volume levels•levels of oil, natural-gas, and natural-gas liquids (NGLs) reserves•operating results•competitive conditions•technology•availability of capital resources, levels of capital expenditures, and other contractual obligations•supply and demand for, the price of, and the commercialization and transporting of oil, natural gas, NGLs, and other products or services•volatility in the commodity-futures market•weather•inflation•availability of goods and services, including unexpected changes in costs•drilling risks•processing volumes and pipeline throughput•general economic conditions, nationally, internationally, or in the jurisdictions in which the Company is, or in the future may be, doing business•the Company’s inability to timely obtain or maintain permits or other governmental approvals, including those necessary for drilling and/or development projects•legislative or regulatory changes, including changes relating to hydraulic fracturing; retroactive royalty or production tax regimes; deepwater drilling and permitting regulations; derivatives reform; changes in state, federal, and foreign income taxes; environmental regulation; environmental risks; and liability under federal, state, foreign, and local environmental laws and regulations29Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•the ability of BP Exploration & Production Inc. (BP) to meet its indemnification obligations to the Company for Deepwater Horizon events, including, among other things, damage claims arising under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), claims for natural resource damages (NRD) and associated damage-assessment costs, and any claims arising under the Operating Agreement (OA) for the Macondo well, as well as the ability of BP Corporation North America Inc. (BPCNA) and BP p.l.c. to satisfy their guarantees of such indemnification obligations•civil or political unrest or acts of terrorism in a region or country•the creditworthiness and performance of the Company’s counterparties, including financial institutions, operating partners, and other parties•volatility in the securities, capital, or credit markets and related risks such as general credit, liquidity, and interest-rate risk•the Company’s ability to successfully monetize select assets, repay or refinance its debt, and the impact of changes in the Company’s credit ratings•disruptions in international oil, NGLs, and condensate cargo shipping activities•physical, digital, internal, and external security breaches•supply and demand, technological, political, governmental, and commercial conditions associated with long-term development and production projects in domestic and international locations•other factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, and in the Company’s other public filings, press releases, and discussions with Company managementRISK FACTORSOil, natural-gas, and NGLs price volatility, including the recent decline in the price for these commodities, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Prices for oil, natural gas, and NGLs can fluctuate widely. For example, New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) West Texas Intermediate oil prices have been volatile and ranged from a high of $107.26 per barrel in June 2014 to a low of $26.21 per barrel in February 2016. Also, NYMEX Henry Hub natural-gas prices have been volatile and ranged from a high of $6.15 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in February 2014 to a low of $1.76 per MMBtu in December 2015. The duration and magnitude of the decline in oil and natural-gas prices cannot be predicted. Our revenues, operating results, cash flows from operations, capital budget, and future growth rates are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our oil, natural gas, and NGLs. The markets for oil, natural gas, and NGLs have been volatile historically and may continue to be volatile in the future. Factors influencing the prices of oil, natural gas, and NGLs are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following: •the domestic and worldwide supply of, and demand for, oil, natural gas, and NGLs•volatility and trading patterns in the commodity-futures markets•the cost of exploring for, developing, producing, transporting, and marketing oil, natural gas, and NGLs•the level of global oil and natural-gas inventories•weather conditions•the level of U.S. exports of oil, condensate, liquefied natural gas, or NGLs•the ability of the members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producing nations to agree to and maintain production levels•the worldwide military and political environment, civil and political unrest in Africa and the Middle East, uncertainty or instability resulting from the escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities, or acts of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere•the effect of worldwide energy conservation and environmental protection efforts30Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•the price and availability of alternative and competing fuels•the level of foreign imports of oil, natural gas, and NGLs•domestic and foreign governmental laws, regulations, and taxes•the proximity to, and capacity of, natural-gas pipelines and other transportation facilities•general economic conditions worldwideThe long-term effect of these and other factors on the prices of oil, natural gas, and NGLs is uncertain. Prolonged or further declines in these commodity prices may have the following effects on our business: •adversely affecting our financial condition, liquidity, ability to finance planned capital expenditures, and results of operations•reducing the amount of oil, natural gas, and NGLs that we can produce economically•causing us to delay or postpone some of our capital projects•reducing our revenues, operating income, or cash flows•reducing the amounts of our estimated proved oil, natural-gas, and NGLs reserves•reducing the carrying value of our oil, natural-gas, and midstream properties due to recognizing additional impairments of proved properties, unproved properties, exploration assets, and midstream facilities•reducing the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to oil, natural-gas, and NGLs reserves•limiting our access to, or increasing the cost of, sources of capital such as equity and long-term debt31Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsA downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital. As of December 31, 2015, our long-term debt was rated “BBB” with a stable outlook by both Standard and Poor’s (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch), and our commercial paper program was rated “A-2” by S&P and “F2” by Fitch. Our long-term debt was rated “Baa2” with a stable outlook and our commercial paper program was rated “P2” by Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) until December 16, 2015, when Moody’s announced that it had placed both ratings under review for downgrade along with the ratings of 28 other U.S. exploration and production companies and their related subsidiaries. In February 2016, S&P affirmed our “BBB” rating and changed the outlook from stable to negative. As of the time of filing this Form 10-K, neither Fitch nor Moody’s had announced any change to our credit ratings; however, we cannot be assured that our credit ratings will not be downgraded. Any downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively impact our cost of capital, and a downgrade to a level that is below investment grade could also adversely affect our ability to effectively execute aspects of our strategy or to raise debt in the public debt markets. In the event of a downgrade in our credit rating to a level that is below investment grade, we may be required to post collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash as financial assurance of our performance under certain contractual arrangements such as pipeline transportation contracts and oil and gas sales contracts. At December 31, 2015, there were no letters of credit or cash provided as assurance of our performance under these type of contractual arrangements with respect to credit-risk-related contingent features. If our credit ratings had been downgraded to a level below investment grade as of December 31, 2015, the collateral required to be posted under these arrangements would have been $460 million. Additionally, certain of these arrangements contain financial assurances language that may, under certain circumstances, permit our counterparties to request additional collateral. Furthermore, in the event of a downgrade to a level that is below investment grade, the credit thresholds with our derivative counterparties may be reduced or, in certain cases, eliminated, which may require the posting of additional collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features for which a net liability position existed on December 31, 2015, was $1.3 billion, net of collateral. As of December 31, 2015, $58 million was posted as cash collateral with our derivative counterparties. For additional information, see Note 9—Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.32Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsWe are subject to complex laws and regulations relating to environmental protection that can adversely affect the cost, manner, and feasibility of doing business.Our operations and properties are subject to numerous federal, provincial, regional, state, tribal, local, and foreign laws and regulations governing the release of pollutants or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations govern the following, among other things:•issuance of permits in connection with exploration, drilling, production, and midstream activities•drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, and other protected areas •types, quantities, and concentrations of emissions, discharges, and authorized releases•generation, management, and disposition of waste materials•offshore oil and natural-gas operations and decommissioning of abandoned facilities•reclamation and abandonment of wells and facility sites•remediation of contaminated sites•protection of endangered speciesThese laws and regulations may impose substantial liabilities for our failure to comply or for any contamination resulting from our operations, including the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal penalties; the imposition of investigatory, remedial, and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures; the occurrence of delays in the permitting, development, or expansion of projects; and the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting some or all of our activities in a particular area. Moreover, changes in, or reinterpretations of, environmental laws and regulations governing areas where we operate may negatively impact our operations. Examples of recent proposed and final regulations include the following: •Proposed Outer Continental Shelf Well Control Rule. In April 2015, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled Oil and Sulfur Operations on the Outer Continental Shelf - Blowout Preventer Systems and Well Control that focuses on well blowout preventer systems and well control with respect to operations on the Outer Continental Shelf. The proposed rule requires, among other things, incorporation of the latest industry standards establishing minimum baseline standards for the design, manufacture, repair, and maintenance of blowout preventers as well as more controls over the maintenance and repair of blowout preventers. This rulemaking is expected to be finalized in 2016. •Ground-Level Ozone Standards. In October 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule under the Clean Air Act, lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ground-level ozone from 75 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion under both the primary and secondary standards to provide requisite protection of public health and welfare, respectively. The final rule became effective in December 2015. Certain areas of the country in compliance with the ground-level ozone NAAQS standard may be reclassified as non-attainment and such reclassification may make it more difficult to construct new or modified sources of air pollution in newly designated non-attainment areas. Moreover, states are expected to implement more stringent regulations, which could apply to our operations. Compliance with this final rule could, among other things, require installation or new emission controls on some of our equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase our capital expenditures and operating costs.•Reduction of Methane Emissions by the Oil and Gas Industry. In August 2015, the EPA proposed rules that will establish emission standards for methane from certain new and modified oil and natural-gas production and natural-gas processing and transmission facilities as part of the Obama Administration’s efforts to reduce methane emissions from the oil and natural-gas sector by up to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025. The EPA’s proposed rule package includes standards to address emissions of methane from equipment and processes across the source category, including hydraulically-fractured oil and natural-gas well completions, fugitive emissions from well sites and compressors, and equipment leaks at natural-gas processing plants and pneumatic pumps. The EPA is expected to finalize these rules in 2016.33Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions. The U.S. Congress and the EPA, in addition to some state and regional efforts, have in recent years considered legislation or regulations to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs). These efforts have included consideration of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, and GHG reporting and tracking programs. In the absence of federal GHG-limiting legislations, the EPA has determined that GHG emissions present a danger to public health and the environment and has adopted regulations that, among other things, restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act and may require the installation of “best available control technology” to limit emissions of GHGs from any new or significantly modified facilities that we may seek to construct in the future if they would otherwise emit large volumes of GHGs together with other criteria pollutants. Also, certain of our operations are subject to EPA rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified onshore and offshore production sources. On an international level, the United States is one of almost 200 nations that, in December 2015, agreed to an international climate change agreement in Paris, France that calls for countries to set their own GHG emissions targets and be transparent about the measures each country will use to achieve its GHG emissions targets.These and other regulatory changes could significantly increase our capital expenditures and operating costs or could result in delays to or limitations on our exploration and production activities, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. For a description of certain environmental proceedings in which we are involved, see Legal Proceedings under Item 3 and Note 15—Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Changes in laws or regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing or other oil and natural-gas operations could increase our costs of doing business, impose additional operating restrictions or delays, and adversely affect our production.Hydraulic fracturing is an essential and common practice used to stimulate production of oil and natural gas from dense subsurface rock formations such as shales. We routinely apply hydraulic-fracturing techniques in many of our U.S. onshore oil and natural-gas drilling and completion programs. The process involves the injection of water, sand, and additives under pressure into a targeted subsurface formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production.Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural-gas commissions. However, several federal agencies have also asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA issued Clean Air Act final regulations in 2012 and proposed additional Clean Air Act regulations in August 2015 governing performance standards for the oil and natural-gas industry; proposed in April 2015 effluent limitations guidelines that waste water from shale natural-gas extraction operations must meet before discharging to a treatment plant; and issued in 2014 a prepublication of its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. Also, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) published a final rule in March 2015 that establishes new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands but, in September 2015, the U.S. District Court of Wyoming issued a preliminary injunction barring implementation of this rule, which order the BLM could appeal and is being separately appealed by certain environmental groups. Also, from time to time, legislation has been introduced, but not enacted, in Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. In the event that a new federal level of legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic-fracturing process is adopted in areas where we operate, we may incur additional costs to comply with such federal requirements that may be significant in nature, and also could become subject to additional permitting requirements and experience added delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities.34Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsCertain states in which we operate, including Colorado, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, Texas, and Wyoming, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure, or other regulatory requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations, including subsurface water disposal. States could elect to prohibit hydraulic fracturing altogether, following the approach taken by the State of New York in 2015. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. For example, several cities in Colorado passed temporary or permanent moratoria on hydraulic fracturing within their respective city limits in 2012 and 2013. Since that time, in response to lawsuits brought by an industry trade group, local district courts struck down the ordinances for certain of those Colorado cities in 2014, primarily on the basis that state law preempts local bans on hydraulic fracturing. A suit brought by the trade group against at least one other Colorado city, Broomfield, remains pending. The cities of Fort Collins and Longmont, among those cities whose ordinances were struck down in 2014, were notified in September 2015 by the Colorado Supreme Court that the high court had agreed to hear their appeals. Notwithstanding attempts at the local level to prohibit hydraulic fracturing, the opportunity exists for cities to adopt local ordinances allowing hydraulic fracturing activities within their jurisdictions while regulating the time, place, and manner of those activities.In addition, certain interest groups in Colorado opposed to oil and natural-gas development generally, and hydraulic fracturing in particular, have from time to time advanced various ballot initiatives aimed at significantly limiting or preventing oil and natural-gas development. In response to one such set of initiatives, the Governor of Colorado created the Task Force on State and Local Regulation of Oil and Gas Operations (Task Force) in September 2014 to make recommendations to the state legislature regarding the responsible development of Colorado’s oil and natural-gas resources. In February 2015, the Task Force made several non-binding recommendations to the Colorado Governor, and recently, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC) undertook a rulemaking process to implement those recommendations. It is possible that the COGCC could undertake additional rulemaking procedures or the Colorado state legislature could introduce and seek to adopt additional legislation relating to oil and natural-gas operations that could limit or prevent oil and natural-gas development. In addition, several ballot initiatives have been proposed for inclusion on the Colorado state ballot in November 2016. Although it is early in the political process, if approved, these initiatives, or others that may be proposed, could give local governments in Colorado greater authority to limit hydraulic fracturing, require greater distances between certain well sites and occupied structures, or otherwise limit the production and development of oil and natural gas.In the event that ballot initiatives, local or state restrictions, or prohibitions are adopted and result in more stringent limitations on the production and development of oil and natural gas in areas where we conduct operations, including the Wattenberg field in Colorado, we may incur significant costs to comply with such requirements or may experience delays or curtailment in the permitting or pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities. In addition, we could possibly be limited or precluded in the drilling of wells or in the amounts that we are ultimately able to produce from our reserves. Such compliance costs and delays, curtailments, limitations, or prohibitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.In addition to asserting regulatory authority, a number of federal entities are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. In April 2012, President Obama issued an executive order that established a working group for the purpose of coordinating policy, information sharing, and planning among federal agencies and offices regarding “unconventional natural-gas production,” including hydraulic fracturing. In June 2015, the EPA released its draft report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, which concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities have not lead to widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water sources in the United States, although there are above and below ground mechanisms by which hydraulic fracturing activities have the potential to impact drinking water sources. However, in January 2016, the EPA’s Science Advisory Board provided its comments on the draft study, indicating its concern that the EPA’s conclusion of no widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water sources arising from fracturing activities did not reflect the uncertainties and data limitations associated with such impacts, as described in the body of the draft report. The final version of this EPA report remains pending and is expected to be completed in 2016. Such EPA final report, when issued, as well as other studies and initiatives or any future studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur efforts to further regulate hydraulic fracturing.35Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsWe may be subject to claims and liabilities relating to the Deepwater Horizon events that result in losses, notwithstanding BP’s indemnification against such losses, as a result of BP’s inability to satisfy its indemnification obligations under the Settlement Agreement and BPCNA’s and BP p.l.c.’s inability to satisfy their guarantees of BP’s indemnification obligations.In October 2011, we and BP entered into a settlement agreement, mutual releases, and agreement to indemnify relating to the Deepwater Horizon events (Settlement Agreement). Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, we are fully indemnified by BP against all claims, causes of action, losses, costs, expenses, liabilities, damages, or judgments of any kind arising out of the Deepwater Horizon events, related damage claims arising under OPA, NRD claims and assessment costs, and any claims arising under the OA. This indemnification is guaranteed by BPCNA and, in the event that the net worth of BPCNA declines below an agreed-on amount, BP p.l.c. has agreed to become the sole guarantor. We are not indemnified against penalties and fines, punitive damages, shareholder derivative or securities laws claims, or certain other claims.In July 2015, BP announced a settlement agreement in principle with the Department of Justice and certain states and local government entities regarding essentially all of the outstanding claims against BP related to the Deepwater Horizon event (BP Settlement) and, in October 2015, lodged a proposed consent decree with the Louisiana District Court. Essentially all claims and liabilities relating to the Deepwater Horizon events that are covered by BP’s indemnification obligations under our Settlement Agreement will be resolved as part of the BP Settlement, provided that the consent decree is ultimately approved by the Louisiana District Court. A hearing related to the consent decree is currently scheduled for March 2016. In the event the consent decree is not approved by the Louisiana District Court, any failure or inability on the part of BP to satisfy its indemnification obligations under the Settlement Agreement, or on the part of BPCNA or BP p.l.c. to satisfy their respective guarantee obligations, could subject us to significant monetary liability beyond the terms of the Settlement Agreement, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Furthermore, in certain instances we may be required to recognize a liability for amounts for which we are indemnified in advance of or in connection with recognizing a receivable from BP for the related indemnity payment. Any such liability recognition without collection of the offsetting receivable could adversely impact our results of operations, our financial condition, and our ability to make borrowings. For additional information, see Note 15—Contingencies—Deepwater Horizon Events in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Our debt and other financial commitments may limit our financial and operating flexibility.Our total debt was $15.8 billion at December 31, 2015. We also have various commitments for leases, drilling contracts, derivative contracts, firm transportation, and purchase obligations for services and products. Our financial commitments could have important consequences to our business, including, but not limited to, the following: •increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions•limiting our ability to fund future working capital and capital expenditures, to engage in future acquisitions or development activities, or to otherwise fully realize the value of our assets and opportunities because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt or to comply with any restrictive terms of our debt•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industry in which we operate•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt and/or fewer financial commitmentsAdditionally, the credit agreements governing our $3.0 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our $2.0 billion 364-day senior unsecured revolving credit facility contain a number of customary covenants, including a financial covenant requiring maintenance of a consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization ratio of no greater than 65% (excluding the effect of non-cash write-downs), and limitations on certain secured indebtedness, sale-and-leaseback transactions, and mergers and other fundamental changes. Our ability to meet such covenants may be affected by events beyond our control.36Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsOur proved reserves are estimates. Any material inaccuracies in our reserves estimates or assumptions underlying our reserves estimates could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated.There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves, including many factors beyond our control that could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated. The reserves information included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K represents estimates prepared by our internal engineers. The procedures and methods for estimating the reserves by our internal engineers were reviewed by independent petroleum consultants; however, no reserves audit was conducted by these consultants. Estimation of reserves is not an exact science. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural-gas reserves and of future net cash flows depend on a number of variable factors and assumptions, any of which may cause actual results to vary considerably from these estimates. These factors and assumptions may include, but are not limited to, the following: •historical production from an area compared with production from similar producing areas•assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and court rulings•assumptions concerning future oil and natural-gas prices, future operating costs, and capital expenditures•estimates of future severance and excise taxes, workover costs, and remedial costsEstimates of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of expected future net cash flows prepared by different engineers, or by the same engineers at different times, may vary substantially. Actual production, revenues, and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates, and the variance may be material. The discounted cash flows included in this Form 10-K should not be construed as the fair value of the estimated oil, natural-gas, and NGLs reserves attributable to our properties. The estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on the average beginning-of-month prices during the 12-month period for the respective year. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from the SEC regulation-compliant prices used for purposes of estimating future discounted net cash flows from proved reserves. Therefore, reserves quantities will change when actual prices increase or decrease. Failure to replace reserves may negatively affect our business.Our future success depends on our ability to find, develop, or acquire additional oil and natural-gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Our proved reserves generally decline when reserves are produced, unless we conduct successful exploration or development activities, acquire properties containing proved reserves, or both. We may be unable to find, develop, or acquire additional reserves on an economic basis. Furthermore, if oil and natural-gas prices increase, our costs for finding or acquiring additional reserves could also increase.Our domestic operations are subject to governmental risks that may impact our operations.Our domestic operations have been, and at times in the future may be, affected by political developments and are subject to complex federal, provincial, regional, state, tribal, local, and other laws and regulations such as restrictions on production, permitting, changes in taxes, deductions, royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies, price or gathering-rate controls, and hydraulic fracturing and environmental protection regulations. To conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals, and certificates from various federal, provincial, regional, state, tribal, and local governmental authorities. We may incur substantial costs to maintain compliance with these existing laws and regulations. Our costs of compliance may increase if existing laws, including environmental and tax laws and regulations, are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations such as the adoption of government-payment-transparency regulations. For example, from time to time, deficit reduction or tax reform legislation has been proposed that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Proposals have included provisions that would, if enacted, (i) eliminate the immediate deduction for intangible drilling and development costs, (ii) eliminate the manufacturing deduction for oil and gas qualified production activities, (iii) eliminate accelerated depreciation for tangible property, and (iv) treat publicly traded partnerships for fossil fuels as C corporations.37Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsFuture economic, business, or industry conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition.During the last few years, concerns over inflation, potential default on U.S. debt, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, and uncertainties with regard to European sovereign debt, have contributed to increased economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy. Concerns about global economic growth have had a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices. Continued concerns could cause demand for petroleum products to diminish or stagnate, which could impact the price at which we can sell our oil, natural gas, and NGLs and impede the execution of long-term sales agreements or prices thereunder which are the basis for future LNG production; affect the ability of our vendors, suppliers, and customers to continue operations; and ultimately adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition.Our results of operations could be adversely affected by goodwill impairments.As a result of mergers and acquisitions, we had approximately $5.4 billion of goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015. Goodwill must be tested at least annually for impairment, and more frequently when circumstances indicate likely impairment. Goodwill is considered impaired to the extent that its carrying amount exceeds its implied fair value. Various factors could reduce the fair value of a reporting unit such as our inability to replace the value of our depleting asset base, difficulty or potential delays in obtaining drilling permits, or other adverse events such as lower oil and natural-gas prices, which could lead to an impairment of goodwill. An impairment of goodwill could have a substantial negative effect on our profitability. We are vulnerable to risks associated with our offshore operations that could negatively impact our operations and financial results.We conduct offshore operations in the Gulf of Mexico, Ghana, Mozambique, Colombia, Côte d’Ivoire, New Zealand, Kenya, and other countries. Our operations and financial results could be significantly impacted by conditions in some of these areas because we are vulnerable to certain unique risks associated with operating offshore, including those relating to the following: •hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions•oilfield service costs and availability•compliance with environmental and other laws and regulations•terrorist attacks such as piracy•remediation and other costs and regulatory changes resulting from oil spills or releases of hazardous materials•failure of equipment or facilitiesIn addition, we conduct some of our exploration in deep waters (greater than 1,000 feet) where operations and decommissioning activities are more difficult and costly than in shallower waters. The deep waters in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as international deepwater locations, lack the physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in shallower waters. As a result, deepwater operations may require significant time between a discovery and the time that we can market our production, thereby increasing the risk involved with these operations. 38Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsAdditional domestic and international deepwater drilling laws, regulations, and other restrictions; delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits and exploration, development, oil spill-response, and decommissioning plans; and other related developments may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.In response to the Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the BSEE, agencies of the U.S. Department of the Interior, imposed more stringent permitting procedures and regulatory safety and performance requirements for new wells to be drilled in federal waters. Compliance with these more stringent rules and regulations, together with any uncertainties or inconsistencies in current decisions and rulings by governmental agencies, delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits or exploration, development, oil spill-response and decommissioning plans, and possible additional regulatory initiatives could adversely affect or delay new drilling and ongoing development efforts. In addition, new regulatory initiatives may be adopted or enforced by the BOEM and/or the BSEE in the future that could result in additional delays, restrictions, or obligations with respect to oil and natural-gas exploration and production operations conducted offshore. For example, in September 2015, the BOEM issued draft guidance that would bolster supplemental bonding procedures for the decommissioning of offshore wells, platforms, pipelines, and other facilities. The BOEM is expected to issue the draft guidance in the form of a final Notice to Lessees and Operators by no later than early summer 2016. These existing rules, or any new rules, regulations, or legal initiatives could delay or disrupt our operations, increase the risk of expired leases due to the time required to develop new technology, result in increased supplemental bonding and costs, and limit activities in certain areas, or cause us to incur penalties, fines, or shut-in production at one or more of our facilities or result in the suspension or cancellation of leases. Also, if material spill events similar to the Deepwater Horizon incident were to occur in the future, the United States or other countries could elect to again issue directives to temporarily cease drilling activities and, in any event, may from time to time issue further safety and environmental laws and regulations regarding offshore oil and gas exploration and development. We cannot predict with any certainty the full impact of any new laws, regulations, or legal initiatives on our drilling operations or on the cost or availability of insurance to cover the risks associated with such operations. The overall costs to implement and complete any such spill response activities or any decommissioning obligations could exceed estimated accruals, insurance limits, or supplemental bonding amounts, which could result in the incurrence of additional costs to complete.Further, the deepwater Gulf of Mexico (as well as international deepwater locations) lacks the degree of physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in shallower waters. Therefore, despite our oil spill-response capabilities, it may be difficult for us to quickly or effectively execute any contingency plans related to potential material events in the future.The matters described above, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.39Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsWe operate in foreign countries and are subject to political, economic, and other uncertainties.We have operations outside the United States, including in Algeria, Ghana, Mozambique, Colombia, Côte d’Ivoire, New Zealand, Kenya, and other countries. As a result, we face political and economic risks and other uncertainties with respect to our international operations. These risks may include the following, among other things: •loss of revenue, property, and equipment or delays in operations as a result of hazards such as expropriation, war, piracy, acts of terrorism, insurrection, civil unrest, and other political risks, including tension and confrontations among political parties•transparency issues in general and, more specifically, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other anti-corruption compliance laws and issues•increases in taxes and governmental royalties•unilateral renegotiation of contracts by governmental entities•redefinition of international boundaries or boundary disputes•difficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations•changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies•foreign-exchange restrictions•international monetary fluctuations and changes in the relative value of the U.S. dollar as compared to the currencies of other countries in which we conduct businessFor example, Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire are engaged in a dispute regarding the international maritime boundary between the two countries. As a result, Côte d’Ivoire claims to be entitled to the maritime area, which covers a portion of the Deepwater Tano Block where we are developing the TEN complex. In the event Côte d’Ivoire is successful in its maritime border claims, this development could be materially impacted. Also, Venezuela and Guyana are in a dispute regarding their maritime and land borders in which the two countries have initiated a dialogue. We are unable to ascertain the full impact of this border dispute on future operations in Guyana.Outbreaks of civil and political unrest and acts of terrorism have occurred in countries in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, including countries close to or where we conduct operations. Continued or escalated civil and political unrest and acts of terrorism in the countries in which we operate could result in our curtailing operations. In the event that countries in which we operate experience civil or political unrest or acts of terrorism, especially in events where such unrest leads to an unseating of the established government, our operations in such countries could be materially impaired.Our international operations may also be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by laws, policies, and regulations of the United States affecting foreign trade and taxation, including U.S. trade sanctions.Realization of any of the factors listed above could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.40Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsOur commodity-price risk-management and trading activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from price increases and may expose us to other risks.To the extent that we engage in commodity-price risk-management activities to protect our cash flows from commodity-price declines, we may be prevented from realizing the full benefits of price increases above the levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk. In addition, our commodity-price risk-management and trading activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the following occur: •our production is less than the notional volumes•a widening of price basis differentials occurs between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the derivative arrangement•the counterparties to our hedging or other price-risk management contracts fail to perform under those arrangements•a sudden unexpected event materially impacts oil, natural-gas, or NGLs pricesThe enactment of derivatives legislation, and the promulgation of regulations pursuant thereto, could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity-price, interest-rate, and other risks associated with its business.The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), enacted in 2010, requires the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations establishing federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market, including swap clearing and trade execution requirements. While many rules and regulations have been promulgated and are already in effect, other rules and regulations, including the proposed position limits rule, remain to be finalized or effectuated, and therefore, the impact of those rules and regulations on us is uncertain at this time. Moreover, the phase-in threshold for swap dealer de minimis purposes is set to expire on December 31, 2017, (and thereby revert from $8 billion to $3 billion) unless the CFTC acts to maintain or change the current $8 billion threshold before that time. The financial reform legislation may require our compliance with a lower de minimis threshold, as well as with margin, position limits, clearing, and trade-execution requirements if certain hedging exemptions are unavailable. Although we expect to qualify for exceptions to such requirements for swaps entered to hedge our commercial risks, the application of such requirements, including to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps that we use for hedging. Moreover, the framework of what qualifies as a bona fide hedge for position-limits purposes is yet uncertain.The Dodd-Frank Act, and the rules promulgated thereunder, could (i) significantly increase the cost, or decrease the liquidity, of energy-related derivatives we use to hedge against commodity-price fluctuations (including through requirements to post collateral), (ii) materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, and (iii) reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and applicable rules and regulations, our cash flow may become more volatile and less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. In addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions are implementing regulations with respect to the derivatives market. To the extent we transact with counterparties in foreign jurisdictions, those transactions may become subject to such regulations. At this time, the impact of such regulations is not clear.41Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsDeterioration in the credit or equity markets could adversely affect us.We have exposure to different counterparties. For example, we have entered into transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies, investment funds, and other institutions. These transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default by our counterparty. Deterioration in the credit markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us. We have exposure to these financial institutions through our derivative transactions. In addition, if any lender under our credit facilities is unable to fund its commitment, our liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender’s commitment under our credit facilities. Moreover, to the extent that purchasers of our production rely on access to the credit or equity markets to fund their operations, there is a risk that those purchasers could default in their contractual obligations to us if such purchasers were unable to access the credit or equity markets for an extended period of time.We are not insured against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed.Our business is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration for and production, gathering, processing, and transportation of oil and natural gas, including blowouts; cratering and fire; environmental hazards such as natural-gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline and vessel ruptures, and releases of chemicals or other hazardous substances, any of which could result in damage to, or destruction of, oil and natural-gas wells or formations, production facilities, and other property; pollution or other environmental damage; and injury to persons. For protection against financial loss resulting from these operating hazards, we maintain insurance coverage, including insurance coverage for certain physical damage, blowout/loss of control of a well, comprehensive general liability, aviation liability, and worker’s compensation and employer’s liability. However, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover us against 100% of potential losses arising as a result of the foregoing and for certain risks, such as political risk, business interruption, war, terrorism, and piracy, for which we have limited or no coverage. In addition, we are not insured against all risks in all aspects of our business such as hurricanes. The occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.Material differences between the estimated and actual timing of critical events may affect the completion of and commencement of production from development projects.We are involved in several large development projects and the completion of those projects may be delayed beyond our anticipated completion dates. Key factors that may affect the timing and outcome of such projects include the following: •project approvals by joint-venture partners•timely issuance of permits and licenses by governmental agencies or legislative and other governmental approvals•weather conditions•availability of qualified personnel•civil and political environment of, and existing infrastructure in, the country or region in which the project is located•manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment•commercial arrangements for pipelines and related equipment to transport and market hydrocarbonsDelays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events may affect the forward-looking statements related to large development projects and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.42Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsThe oil and gas exploration and production industry is very competitive, and some of our exploration and production competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do.The oil and gas business is highly competitive in the search for and acquisition of reserves and in the gathering and marketing of oil and gas production. Our competitors include national oil companies, major integrated oil and gas companies, independent oil and gas companies, individual producers, gas marketers, and major pipeline companies as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to consumers. Some of our competitors may have greater and more diverse resources on which to draw than we do. If we are not successful in our competition for oil and gas reserves or in our marketing of production, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.The high cost or unavailability of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel, and other oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.Our industry is cyclical and, from time to time, there is a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, or qualified personnel. During these periods, the costs of rigs, equipment, supplies, and personnel are substantially greater and their availability to us may be limited. Additionally, these services may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. The high cost or unavailability of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel, and other oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.Our drilling activities may not be productive.Drilling for oil and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or natural-gas reservoirs. Drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed, or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including the following: •unexpected drilling conditions•pressure or irregularities in formations•equipment failures or accidents•fires, explosions, blowouts, and surface cratering•marine risks such as capsizing, collisions, and hurricanes•difficulty identifying and retaining qualified personnel•title problems•other adverse weather conditions•shortages or delays in the delivery of equipmentCertain of our future drilling activities may not be successful and, if unsuccessful, this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. While all drilling, whether developmental or exploratory, involves these risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Because of the percentage of our capital budget devoted to high-risk exploratory projects, it is likely that we will continue to experience significant exploration and dry hole expenses.43Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsWe have limited influence over the activities on properties we do not operate.Other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest. We have limited ability to influence the operation or future development of these nonoperated properties or the amount or timing of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them. Our dependence on the operator and other working-interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital, lead to unexpected future costs, or adversely affect the timing of activities.Our ability to sell our oil, natural-gas, and NGLs production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation.The marketability of our production depends in part on the availability, proximity, and capacity of pipeline facilities and tanker transportation. If any pipelines or tankers become unavailable, we would, to the extent possible, be required to find a suitable alternative to transport the oil, natural gas, and NGLs, which could increase our costs and/or reduce the revenues we might obtain from the sale of the oil and gas.Our business could be negatively affected by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and other disruptions.As an oil and gas producer, we face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats such as attempts to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable; threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or those of third parties such as processing plants and pipelines; and threats from terrorist acts. Our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information, facilities, and infrastructure may result in increased costs. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. Cybersecurity attacks in particular are becoming more sophisticated and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and systems, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corruption of data, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.While we have experienced cybersecurity attacks, we have not suffered any material losses relating to such attacks; however, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. In addition, as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate or remediate any cybersecurity vulnerabilities.Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control of Anadarko, even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders.Our restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that may make a change of control of Anadarko difficult, even if it may be beneficial to our stockholders, including provisions governing the nomination and removal of directors, the prohibition of stockholder action by written consent and regulation of stockholders’ ability to bring matters for action before annual stockholder meetings, and the authorization given to our Board of Directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock.In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock.44Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsWe may reduce or cease to pay dividends on our common stock.We can provide no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at the current rate or at all. In response to the current commodity-price environment, the Company decreased the quarterly dividend from $0.27 per share to $0.05 per share in February 2016. The amount of cash dividends, if any, to be paid in the future is determined by our Board of Directors based on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, levels of capital and exploration expenditures, future business prospects, expected liquidity needs, and other matters that our Board of Directors deems relevant.The loss of key members of our management team, or difficulty attracting and retaining experienced technical personnel, could reduce our competitiveness and prospects for future success.The successful implementation of our strategies and handling of other issues integral to our future success will depend, in part, on our experienced management team. The loss of key members of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business. We do not carry key man insurance. Our exploratory drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced explorationists, engineers, and other professionals. Competition for such professionals could be intense. If we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel, our ability to compete could be harmed. Item 1B
