ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.


 


    CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ current insurance program
    does not extend to cover the risks of certain environmental
    cleanup costs or environmental damages, such as claims for air
    pollution, damage to sites owned by CMS Energy or Consumers, and
    for some past PCB contamination, and for some long-term storage
    or disposal of pollutants.

    CMS ENERGY AND
    CONSUMERS COMPETITION


 



    Electric
    Competition


 


    Consumers’ electric utility business experiences actual and
    potential competition from many sources, both in the wholesale
    and retail markets, as well as in electric generation, electric
    delivery, and retail services.


 


    The Customer Choice Act allows all of our electric customers to
    buy electric generation service from us or from an alternative
    electric supplier. However, legislation enacted in Michigan in
    October 2008 revised the Customer Choice Act and generally
    limits alternative electric supply to 10 percent of our
    weather-adjusted retail sales for the preceding calendar year.
    At December 2008, alternative electric suppliers were providing
    332 MW of generation service to ROA customers, which is
    equivalent to 4 percent of our weather-adjusted retail
    sales from the preceding calendar year.


 


    Consumers also has competition or potential competition from:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    industrial customers relocating all or a portion of their
    production capacity outside Consumers’ service territory
    for economic reasons;




 



     
        • 

    
    municipalities owning or operating competing electric delivery
    systems;




 



     
        • 

    
    customer self-generation; and




 



     
        • 

    
    adjacent utilities that extend lines to customers in contiguous
    service territories.





 


    Consumers addresses this competition by monitoring activity in
    adjacent areas and enforcing compliance with the MPSC and the
    FERC rules, providing non-energy services, and providing
    tariff-based incentives that support economic development.


 


    Consumers offers non-energy revenue-producing services to
    electric customers, municipalities and other utilities in an
    effort to offset costs. These services include engineering and
    consulting, construction of customer-owned distribution
    facilities, sales of equipment (such as transformers), power
    quality analysis, energy management services, meter reading, and
    joint construction for phone and cable. In these activities,
    Consumers faces competition from many sources, including energy
    management services companies, other utilities, contractors, and
    retail merchandisers.


 


    CMS ERM, a non-utility electric subsidiary, continues to focus
    on optimizing CMS Energy’s independent power production
    portfolio. CMS Energy’s independent power production
    business, a non-utility electric subsidiary, faces competition
    from generators, marketers and brokers, as well as other
    utilities marketing power in the wholesale market.


 



    Gas
    Competition


 


    Competition exists in various aspects of Consumers’ gas
    utility business, and is likely to increase. Competition comes
    from other gas suppliers taking advantage of direct access to
    Consumers’ customers and from alternative fuels and energy
    sources, such as propane, oil, and electricity.


 



    INSURANCE


 


    CMS Energy and its subsidiaries, including Consumers, maintain
    insurance coverage similar to comparable companies in the same
    lines of business. The insurance policies are subject to terms,
    conditions, limitations and exclusions that might not fully
    compensate CMS Energy for all losses. A portion of each loss is
    generally assumed by CMS Energy in the form of deductibles and
    self-insured retentions that, in some cases, are substantial. As
    CMS Energy renews its policies it is possible that some of the
    current insurance coverage may not be renewed or obtainable on
    commercially reasonable terms due to restrictive insurance
    markets.

    ITEM 1A. RISK
    FACTORS
    


 


    Actual results in future periods for CMS Energy and Consumers
    could differ materially from historical results and the
    forward-looking statements contained in this report. Factors
    that might cause or contribute to these differences include, but
    are not limited to, those discussed in the following sections.
    The companies’ business is influenced by many factors that
    are difficult to predict, involve uncertainties that may
    materially affect actual results and are often beyond the
    companies’ control. Additional risks and uncertainties not
    presently known or that the companies’ management currently
    believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect the
    companies. The risk factors described in the following sections,
    as well as the other information included in this annual report
    and in the other documents filed with the SEC, should be
    considered carefully before making an investment in securities
    of CMS Energy and Consumers. Risk factors of Consumers are also
    risk factors of CMS Energy.


 



    CMS
    Energy depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its
    debt service obligations.


 


    Due to its holding company structure, CMS Energy depends on
    dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service
    obligations. Restrictions contained in Consumers’ preferred
    stock provisions and other legal restrictions, such as certain
    terms in its articles of incorporation and FERC requirements,
    limit Consumers’ ability to pay dividends or acquire its
    own stock from CMS Energy. At December 31, 2008, Consumers
    had $331 million of unrestricted retained earnings
    available to pay common stock dividends. If sufficient dividends
    are not paid to CMS Energy by its subsidiaries, CMS Energy may
    not be able to generate the funds necessary to fulfill its cash
    obligations, thereby adversely affecting its liquidity and
    financial condition.


 



    CMS
    Energy has substantial indebtedness that could limit its
    financial flexibility and hence its ability to meet its debt
    service obligations.


 


    As of December 31, 2008, CMS Energy had $1.881 billion
    aggregate principal amount of indebtedness, including
    $178 million of subordinated indebtedness relating to its
    convertible preferred securities. Subsidiary debt of
    $4.549 billion is not included in the preceding total. As
    of December 31, 2008, there were $105 million of
    borrowings and $24 million of letters of credit outstanding
    under CMS Energy’s revolving credit agreement. CMS Energy
    and its subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the
    future.


 


    The level of CMS Energy’s present and future indebtedness
    could have several important effects on its future operations,
    including, among others:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    a significant portion of its cash flow from operations will be
    dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its
    indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes;




 



     
        • 

    
    covenants contained in its existing debt arrangements require it
    to meet certain financial tests, which may affect its
    flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in its
    business;




 



     
        • 

    
    its ability to obtain additional financing for working capital,
    capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and
    other purposes may be limited;




 



     
        • 

    
    it may be at a competitive disadvantage to its competitors that
    are less leveraged;




 



     
        • 

    
    its vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions
    may increase; and




 



     
        • 

    
    its future credit ratings.





 


    CMS Energy’s ability to meet its debt service obligations
    and to reduce its total indebtedness will depend on its future
    performance, which will be subject to general economic
    conditions, industry cycles, regulatory decisions and financial,
    business and other factors affecting its operations, many of
    which are beyond its control. CMS Energy cannot make assurances
    that its business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow
    from operations to service its indebtedness. If it is unable to
    generate sufficient cash flows from operations, it may be
    required to sell additional assets or obtain additional
    financing. CMS Energy cannot assure that additional financing
    will be available on commercially acceptable terms or at all.

    CMS
    Energy cannot predict the outcome of claims regarding its
    participation in the development of Bay Harbor.


 


    As part of the development of Bay Harbor by certain subsidiaries
    of CMS Energy, pursuant to an agreement with the MDEQ, third
    parties constructed a golf course and park over several
    abandoned CKD piles, left over from the former cement plant
    operations on the Bay Harbor site. The third parties also
    undertook a series of remedial actions, including removing
    abandoned buildings and equipment; consolidating, shaping and
    covering CKD piles with soil and vegetation; removing CKD from
    streams and beaches; and constructing a leachate collection
    system at an identified seep. Leachate is formed when water
    passes through CKD. In 2002, CMS Energy sold its interest in Bay
    Harbor, but retained its obligations under environmental
    indemnifications entered into at the start of the project.


 


    In 2005, the EPA along with CMS Land and CMS Capital voluntarily
    executed an AOC under Superfund and approved a Removal Action
    Work Plan to address issues at Bay Harbor. Collection systems
    required under the plan have been installed and shoreline
    monitoring is ongoing. In February 2008, CMS Land and CMS
    Capital submitted a proposed augmentation plan to the EPA to
    address areas where pH measurements are not satisfactory. CMS
    Land, CMS Capital and the EPA have agreed upon the augmentation
    measures and a schedule for their installation. The augmentation
    measures are being implemented and are anticipated to be
    completed in 2009.


 


    In February 2008, the MDEQ and the EPA granted permits for CMS
    Land or its affiliate, Beeland, to construct and operate a deep
    injection well near Alba, Michigan in eastern Antrim County.
    Certain environmental groups, a local township, and a local
    county filed an appeal of the EPA’s decision and, following
    denial by the MDEQ of a right to a hearing, filed lawsuits in
    the Ingham Circuit Court appealing the permits. The EPA has
    denied the appeal. One appeal relating to the state permit
    remains pending in the state court. Groups opposed to the
    injection well filed a lawsuit in Antrim County seeking an
    injunction against development of the well. In January 2009, the
    trial judge issued a preliminary injunction. Beeland is
    considering an appeal of the court’s order.


 


    CMS Land and CMS Capital, the MDEQ, the EPA, and other parties
    are having ongoing discussions concerning the long-term remedy
    for the Bay Harbor sites. These discussions are addressing,
    among other things, issues relating to:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    the disposal of leachate,




 



     
        • 

    
    the capping and excavation of CKD,




 



     
        • 

    
    the location and design of collection lines and upstream
    diversion of water,




 



     
        • 

    
    potential flow of leachate below the collection system,




 



     
        • 

    
    applicable criteria for various substances such as
    mercury, and




 



     
        • 

    
    other matters that are likely to affect the scope of remedial
    work that CMS Land and CMS Capital may be obligated to undertake.





 


    CMS Energy has recorded a cumulative charge of
    $141 million, which includes accretion expense, for its
    obligations. Depending on the size of any indemnification
    obligation or liability under environmental laws, an adverse
    outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on
    CMS Energy’s liquidity and financial condition and could
    negatively impact CMS Energy’s financial results. CMS
    Energy cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this
    matter.


 



    CMS
    Energy may be adversely affected by regulatory investigations
    and civil lawsuits regarding pricing information that CMS MST
    and CMS Field Services provided to market
    publications.


 


    CMS Energy notified appropriate regulatory and governmental
    agencies that some employees at CMS MST and CMS Field Services
    appeared to have provided inaccurate information regarding
    natural gas trades to various energy industry publications which
    compile and report index prices. CMS Energy is cooperating with
    an ongoing investigation by the DOJ regarding this matter. CMS
    Energy is unable to predict the outcome of the DOJ investigation
    and what effect, if any, the investigation will have on CMS
    Energy.

    CMS Energy, CMS MST, CMS Field Services, Cantera Natural Gas,
    Inc. (the company that purchased CMS Field Services) and Cantera
    Gas Company were named as defendants in various lawsuits arising
    as a result of alleged false natural gas price reporting.
    Allegations included manipulation of NYMEX natural gas futures
    and options prices, price-fixing conspiracies and artificial
    inflation of natural gas retail prices in California, Colorado,
    Kansas, Missouri, Tennessee and Wisconsin. CMS Energy cannot
    predict the outcome of the lawsuits. It is possible that the
    outcome in one or more of the lawsuits could affect adversely
    CMS Energy’s liquidity, financial condition and results of
    operations.


 



    CMS
    Energy and Consumers retain contingent liabilities in connection
    with their asset sales.


 


    The agreements that CMS Energy and Consumers enter into for the
    sale of assets customarily include provisions whereby they are
    required to:


 




    
    
    



     
        • 

    
    retain specified preexisting liabilities, such as for taxes,
    pensions or environmental conditions;




 



     
        • 

    
    indemnify the buyers against specified risks, including the
    inaccuracy of representations and warranties they make; and




 



     
        • 

    
    make payments to the buyers depending on the outcome of
    post-closing adjustments, litigation, audits or other reviews.





 


    Many of these contingent liabilities can remain open for
    extended periods of time after the sales are closed. Depending
    on the extent to which the buyers may ultimately seek to enforce
    their rights under these contractual provisions, and the
    resolution of any disputes concerning them, there could be a
    material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s or Consumers’
    liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.


 



    CMS
    Energy and Consumers have financing needs and may be unable to
    obtain bank financing or access the capital markets. If the
    national and worldwide financial crisis intensifies, potential
    disruption in the capital and credit markets may adversely
    affect CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses,
    including the availability and cost of short-term funds for
    liquidity requirements and their ability to meet long-term
    commitments; each could adversely affect their liquidity,
    financial condition and results of operations.


 


    CMS Energy and Consumers may be subject to liquidity demands
    pursuant to commercial commitments, under guarantees,
    indemnities and letters of credit. Consumers’ capital
    requirements are expected to be substantial over the next
    several years as it implements generation and environmental
    projects.


 


    CMS Energy and Consumers rely on the capital markets,
    particularly for publicly offered debt, as well as the banking
    and commercial paper markets, to meet their financial
    commitments and short-term liquidity needs if internal funds are
    not available from CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    respective operations. CMS Energy and Consumers also use letters
    of credit issued under each of their revolving credit facilities
    to support certain operations and investments. Disruptions in
    the capital and credit markets, as have been experienced during
    2008, and continuing in 2009, could adversely affect CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ ability to draw on their
    respective bank revolving credit facilities. CMS Energy’s
    and Consumers’ access to funds under those credit
    facilities is dependent on the ability of the banks that are
    parties to the facilities to meet their funding commitments.
    Those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to
    CMS Energy and Consumers if they experience shortages of capital
    and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of
    borrowing requests from CMS Energy and Consumers and other
    borrowers within a short period of time.


 


    Longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a
    result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced
    alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions
    could adversely affect CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    access to liquidity needed for their respective businesses. Any
    disruption could require CMS Energy and Consumers to take
    measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until
    alternative credit arrangements or other funding for their
    business needs can be arranged. These measures could include
    deferring capital expenditures, changing CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ commodity purchasing strategy to avoid
    collateral-posting requirements, and reducing or eliminating
    future share repurchases, dividend payments or other
    discretionary uses of cash.

    CMS Energy continues to explore financing opportunities to
    supplement its financial plan. These potential opportunities
    include refinancing
    and/or
    issuing new capital markets debt, preferred stock
    and/or
    common equity, and bank financing. CMS Energy cannot guarantee
    the capital markets’ acceptance of its securities or
    predict the impact of factors beyond its control, such as
    actions of rating agencies. If CMS Energy is unable to obtain
    bank financing or access the capital markets to incur or
    refinance indebtedness, there could be a material adverse effect
    on its liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.
    Similarly, Consumers currently plans to seek funds through the
    capital markets, commercial lenders and leasing arrangements.
    Entering into new financings is subject in part to capital
    market receptivity to utility industry securities in general and
    to Consumers’ securities issuances in particular. Consumers
    cannot guarantee the capital markets’ acceptance of its
    securities or predict the impact of factors beyond its control,
    such as actions of rating agencies. If Consumers is unable to
    obtain bank financing or access the capital markets to incur or
    refinance indebtedness, there could be a material adverse effect
    on its liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.


 


    Certain of CMS Energy’s securities and those of its
    affiliates, including Consumers, are rated by various credit
    rating agencies. Any reduction or withdrawal of one or more of
    its credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on CMS
    Energy’s or Consumers’ ability to access capital on
    acceptable terms and maintain commodity lines of credit and
    could make its cost of borrowing higher. If it is unable to
    maintain commodity lines of credit, CMS Energy or Consumers may
    have to post collateral or make prepayments to certain of its
    suppliers pursuant to existing contracts with them. Further, any
    adverse developments to Consumers, which provides dividends to
    CMS Energy, that result in a lowering of Consumers’ credit
    ratings could have an adverse effect on CMS Energy’s credit
    ratings. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot guarantee that any of
    their current ratings will remain in effect for any given period
    of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn
    entirely by a rating agency.


 



    Electric
    industry regulation could adversely affect CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ business, including their ability to recover
    costs from their customers.


 


    Federal and state regulation of electric utilities has changed
    dramatically in the last two decades and could continue to
    change over the next several years. These changes could have a
    material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.


 


    CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to, or affected by,
    extensive federal and state utility regulation. In CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ business planning and
    management of operations, they must address the effects of
    existing and proposed regulation on their businesses and changes
    in the regulatory framework, including initiatives by federal
    and state legislatures, regional transmission organizations,
    utility regulators and taxing authorities. Adoption of new
    regulations by federal or state agencies, or changes to current
    regulations and interpretations of these regulations may
    adversely affect CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.


 


    There are multiple proceedings pending before the FERC involving
    transmission rates, regional transmission organizations and
    electric bulk power markets and transmission. The FERC reviewed
    the standards under which electric utilities are allowed to
    participate in wholesale power markets without price
    restrictions. In June 2007, the FERC issued a final rule on
    these standards that did not impact negatively Consumers’
    ability to retain its market-based rate authority. The
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has been
    petitioned to review portions of this final rule. CMS Energy and
    Consumers cannot predict the impact of these electric industry
    restructuring proceedings on their liquidity, financial
    condition or results of operations.


 



    CMS
    Energy and Consumers could incur significant costs to comply
    with environmental standards and face difficulty in recovering
    these costs on a current basis.


 


    CMS Energy, Consumers and their subsidiaries are subject to
    costly and increasingly stringent environmental regulations.
    They expect that the cost of future environmental compliance,
    especially compliance with clean air and water laws, will be
    significant. Federal rules governing coal-based electric
    generating plant emission controls for nitrogen oxides, sulfur
    dioxide and mercury are being reviewed by the courts.


 


    The U.S. Supreme Court, in Massachusetts v. EPA, has
    remanded a claim to the EPA to consider whether greenhouse gases
    should be regulated as a pollutant under the Clean Air Act. The
    EPA is reviewing the matter. There



    
    28



Table of Contents




    are also pending regulatory and judicial actions which seek to
    have either existing or new coal-based power plants be subject
    to greenhouse gas regulation under the Clean Air Act. In
    addition, legislative proposals have been before the
    U.S. Congress pertaining to the potential regulation or
    control of carbon dioxide emissions and other greenhouse gases.
    These or similar proposals are considered likely to be enacted
    in some form and could have a significant impact upon the
    operation and cost of existing and planned future coal-based
    power plants.


 


    In 2008, Consumers obtained 52 percent of its energy from
    purchased and interchange power and 48 percent of its
    energy from Consumers-owned generation. Of the amount of energy
    obtained from Consumers-owned generation, 95 percent came
    from coal-based power plants. The electric energy from its coal,
    gas and oil-based power plants would be subject to carbon
    dioxide emissions regulations. In 2008, it is estimated that
    carbon dioxide emissions from Consumers-owned coal-based power
    plants, excluding the portion of jointly-owned Campbell Unit 3,
    exceeded approximately 19 million tons of carbon dioxide.
    Enterprises also has interests in coal-based power plants and
    other types of power plants that produce carbon emissions. These
    plants would also be subject to carbon dioxide emissions
    regulations. These proposals, if enacted, could require the
    purchase of allowances for, or taxation of, carbon emissions,
    could require the curtailment of use of coal-based power plants,
    or could require the use of other alternatives to fossil-fuel
    based generating capacity
    and/or
    otherwise could significantly affect Consumers’ and
    Enterprises operations and plans for, and costs associated with
    their fossil-fuel generating plants and purchased power.


 


    There are ongoing state-level and Midwest regional greenhouse
    gas regulatory initiatives. The State of Michigan has convened
    the Michigan Climate Action Council, a climate change
    stakeholder process. Michigan is also a signatory participant in
    the Midwest Governors Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord process.
    The governor of Michigan recently proposed a 45 percent
    reduction in the use of fossil fuel for electric generation by
    2020. The governor’s office has subsequently advised us
    that the 45 percent is only a suggested target, and is
    intended to apply only to coal-based generation. She also issued
    an executive directive requiring the MDEQ to determine whether
    an electric generation need exists that would be served by a
    proposed coal-based power plant; and if such need exists, to
    consider reasonable and prudent alternatives to coal before
    issuing an air permit for the proposed coal-based power plant.
    The Michigan attorney general issued an opinion that invalidated
    the governor’s directive on the basis that the
    governor’s directive exceeded the governor’s
    authority. If the attorney general’s action is challenged
    and the directive is ultimately upheld, it will have a
    significant impact upon the operation and cost of existing and
    planned future coal-based power plants.


 


    Other laws, proposals, rules and judicial interpretations of
    presently existing laws that govern areas such as electric
    generating plant cooling water intake systems and electric
    generating plant modifications could have a significant impact
    upon their generating plants. The EPA is currently contesting
    the applicability of NSR standards to certain of Consumers’
    coal-based plant projects, which if the EPA’s position is
    sustained, could lead to costly environmental upgrades, monetary
    sanctions, or both. If these measures or similar state measures
    are enacted or become effective, CMS Energy and Consumers could
    be required to replace equipment, install additional equipment,
    restructure or shut down operations at various facilities.


 


    CMS Energy and Consumers expect to collect fully from their
    customers, through the ratemaking process, expenditures incurred
    to comply with environmental regulations. However, if these
    expenditures are not recovered from customers in Consumers’
    rates, CMS Energy
    and/or
    Consumers may be required to seek significant additional
    financing to fund these expenditures. This action could strain
    their cash resources. We can give no assurances that CMS Energy
    and/or
    Consumers will have access to bank financing or capital markets
    to fund these environmental expenditures.


 



    Market
    performance and other changes may decrease the value of benefit
    plan assets, which then could require significant
    funding.


 


    The performance of the capital markets affects the values of
    assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations
    under CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ pension and
    postretirement benefit plans. CMS Energy and Consumers have
    significant obligations in this area and hold significant assets
    in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuations
    and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ forecasted return rates. A
    decline in the market value of the assets or a change in the
    level of interest rates used to



    
    29



Table of Contents




    measure the required minimum funding levels may increase the
    funding requirements of these obligations. Also, changes in
    demographics, including increased number of retirements or
    changes in life expectancy assumptions, may increase the funding
    requirements of the obligations related to the pension and
    postretirement benefit plans. If CMS Energy and Consumers are
    unable to successfully manage their pension and postretirement
    plan assets, it could affect negatively their liquidity,
    financial condition and results of operations.


 



    Periodic
    reviews of the values of CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    assets could result in accounting charges.


 


    CMS Energy and Consumers are required by GAAP to review
    periodically the carrying value of their assets, including those
    that may be sold. Market conditions, the operational
    characteristics of their assets and other factors could result
    in recording additional impairment charges for their assets,
    which could have an adverse effect on their stockholders’
    equity and their access to additional financing. In addition,
    CMS Energy and Consumers may be required to record impairment
    charges at the time they sell assets, depending on the sale
    prices they are able to secure and other factors.


 



    CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ revenues and results of
    operations are subject to risks that are beyond their control,
    including but not limited to future terrorist attacks or related
    acts of war.


 


    The cost of repairing damage to CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ facilities due to storms, natural disasters,
    wars, terrorist acts and other catastrophic events, in excess of
    insurance recoveries and reserves established for these repairs,
    may affect adversely their liquidity, financial condition and
    results of operations. The occurrence or risk of occurrence of
    future terrorist activity and the high cost or potential
    unavailability of insurance to cover this terrorist activity may
    affect their liquidity, financial condition and results of
    operations in unpredictable ways. These actions could also
    result in disruptions of power and fuel markets. Instability in
    the financial markets as a result of terrorism, war or natural
    disasters, credit crises, recessions or other factors may
    adversely affect CMS Energy’s and Consumers’
    liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.


 



    Energy
    risk management strategies may not be effective in managing fuel
    and electricity pricing risks, which could result in
    unanticipated liabilities to Consumers and CMS Energy or
    increased volatility of its earnings.


 


    Consumers is exposed to changes in market prices for natural
    gas, coal, electricity and emission credits. Prices for natural
    gas, coal, electricity and emission credits may fluctuate
    substantially over relatively short periods of time and expose
    Consumers to commodity price risk. A substantial portion of
    Consumers’ operating expenses for its plants consists of
    the costs of obtaining these commodities. Consumers manages
    these risks using established policies and procedures, and it
    may use various contracts to manage these risks, including
    swaps, options, futures and forward contracts. No assurance can
    be made that these strategies will be successful in managing
    Consumers’ pricing risk or that they will not result in net
    liabilities to Consumers as a result of future volatility in
    these markets.


 


    Natural gas prices in particular have historically been
    volatile. Consumers routinely enters into contracts to mitigate
    exposure to the risks of demand, market effects of weather and
    changes in commodity prices associated with its gas distribution
    business. These contracts are executed in conjunction with the
    GCR mechanism, which is designed to allow Consumers to recover
    prudently incurred costs associated with those positions.
    However, Consumers does not always hedge the entire exposure of
    its operations from commodity price volatility. Furthermore, the
    ability to hedge exposure to commodity price volatility depends
    on liquid commodity markets. As a result, to the extent the
    commodity markets are illiquid, Consumers may not be able to
    execute its risk management strategies, which could result in
    greater unhedged positions than preferred at a given time. To
    the extent that unhedged positions exist, fluctuating commodity
    prices can improve or worsen CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ liquidity, financial condition and results of
    operations.


 


    In addition, Consumers included in its
    2009-10 GCR
    filing a proposal to extend the GCR forward purchase period by
    two years beyond the typical three-year period, through the
    2013-14 GCR
    period. These potential additional gas purchases could have a
    significant impact on Consumers’ credit requirements and
    could result in significant margin calls if prices were to fall
    below the forward purchase prices of gas purchased.

    Changes
    in taxation as well as inherent difficulty in quantifying
    potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively
    impact CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ results of
    operations.


 


    CMS Energy and Consumers are required to make judgments
    regarding the potential tax effects of various financial
    transactions and results of operations in order to estimate
    their obligations to taxing authorities. The tax obligations
    include income, real estate, sales and use taxes,
    employment-related taxes and ongoing issues related to these tax
    matters. The judgments include reserves for potential adverse
    outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken that may
    be subject to challenge by the IRS
    and/or other
    taxing authorities. Unfavorable settlements of any of the issues
    related to these reserves at CMS Energy or Consumers could
    adversely affect their liquidity, financial condition and
    results of operations.


 



    Consumers
    is exposed to risks related to general economic conditions in
    its service territories.


 


    Consumers’ electric and gas utility businesses are impacted
    by the economic conditions of the customers it serves. In its
    service territories in Michigan, the economy has been hampered
    by the continued downturn and financial uncertainty in the
    automotive industry. Michigan’s economy has also been
    impacted negatively by the uncertainty in the financial and
    credit markets resulting from the subprime mortgage crisis. In
    the event economic conditions in Michigan or the region continue
    to decline, Consumers may experience reduced demand for
    electricity or natural gas that could result in decreased
    earnings and cash flow. In addition, economic conditions in its
    service territory affect its collections of accounts receivable,
    liquidity and financial condition.


 



    CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ energy sales and operations
    are impacted by seasonal factors and varying weather conditions
    from year to year.


 


    CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses are generally
    seasonal. Demand for electricity is greater in the summer and
    winter months associated with cooling and heating, and demand
    for natural gas peaks in the winter heating season. Accordingly,
    their overall results in the future may fluctuate substantially
    on a seasonal basis. Mild temperatures during the summer cooling
    season and winter heating season will adversely affect CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ liquidity, financial condition
    and results of operations.


 



    Unplanned
    power plant outages may be costly for Consumers.


 


    Unforeseen maintenance may be required to produce electricity.
    As a result of unforeseen maintenance, Consumers may be required
    to incur unplanned expenses and to make spot market purchases of
    electricity that exceed its costs of generation. Its liquidity,
    financial condition and results of operations may be adversely
    affected if it is unable to recover those increased costs.


 



    Failure
    to succeed in implementing new processes and information systems
    could interrupt our operations.


 


    CMS Energy and Consumers depend on numerous information systems
    for operations and financial information and billings. They
    completed recently a multi-year company-wide initiative to
    improve existing processes and implement new core information
    systems. Failure to implement successfully new processes and new
    core information systems could interrupt their operations.


 



    Consumers
    may not be able to obtain an adequate supply of coal, which
    could limit its ability to operate its facilities.


 


    Consumers is dependent on coal for much of its electric
    generating capacity. While Consumers has coal supply and
    transportation contracts in place, there can be no assurance
    that the counterparties to these agreements will fulfill their
    obligations to supply coal to Consumers. The suppliers under the
    agreements may experience financial or operational problems that
    inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations to Consumers.
    In addition, suppliers under these agreements may not be
    required to supply coal to Consumers under certain
    circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster. If it
    is unable to obtain its coal requirements under existing or
    future coal supply and transportation contracts, Consumers may
    be required to purchase coal at higher prices, or it may be
    forced to make additional MWh purchases through other
    potentially higher cost generating resources in the Midwest
    Energy Market. Higher coal costs increase its working capital
    requirements.

    CMS
    Energy and Consumers are subject to rate
    regulation.


 


    CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to rate regulation.
    Electric and gas rates for their utilities are set by the MPSC
    and cannot be increased without regulatory authorization. The
    FERC authorizes certain subsidiaries of CMS Energy to sell
    electricity at market-based rates. CMS Energy and Consumers may
    be impacted negatively by new regulations or interpretations by
    the MPSC, the FERC or other regulatory bodies. Failure of CMS
    Energy and Consumers to obtain adequate rates or regulatory
    approvals in a timely manner may adversely affect CMS
    Energy’s and Consumers’ liquidity, financial
    condition, and results of operations. New legislation,
    regulations or interpretations could change how the business of
    CMS Energy and Consumers operates, impact the ability of CMS
    Energy and Consumers to recover costs through rate increases or
    require CMS Energy and Consumers to incur additional expenses.


 



    CMS
    Energy and Consumers are exposed to credit risk of those with
    whom they do business.


 


    CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to credit risk of
    counterparties with whom they do business. Adverse economic
    conditions affecting, or the financial difficulties of,
    counterparties with whom they do business could impair the
    ability of these counterparties to pay for CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ services or fulfill their contractual
    obligations, including performance
    and/or
    payment of damages. CMS Energy and Consumers depend on these
    counterparties to remit payments and perform services on a
    timely basis. Any delay or default in payment
    and/or
    performance of contractual obligations could adversely affect
    CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ liquidity, financial
    condition and results of operations. The capital and credit
    markets have been experiencing levels of volatility and
    disruption unprecedented in recent years. Market disruption and
    volatility could have a negative impact on CMS Energy’s and
    Consumers’ lenders, suppliers and other counterparties or
    Consumers’ customers, causing them to fail to meet their
    obligations. Adverse economic conditions could also have a
    negative impact on the loan portfolio of CMS Energy’s
    banking subsidiary, EnerBank.


 



    CMS
    Energy could be required to pay cash to certain security holders
    in connection with the optional conversion of their convertible
    securities.


 


    CMS Energy has issued three series of cash-convertible
    securities, of which an aggregate principal amount (or par value
    in the case of preferred stock) of approximately
    $677 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2008.
    If the trading price of CMS Energy’s common stock exceeds
    specified amounts at the end of a particular fiscal quarter,
    then holders of one or more series of these convertible
    securities will have the option to convert their securities in
    the following fiscal quarter, with the principal amount (or par

    Consumers
    has a significant capital investment program planned for the
    next five years.


 


    Consumers’ planned investments include a new coal-based
    power generation plant, an advanced metering infrastructure
    program, renewable power generation, gas compression, and other
    electric and gas infrastructure to upgrade delivery systems. The
    success of these investments depends on or could be affected by
    a variety of factors including, but not limited to, effective
    cost and schedule management during implementation, changes in
    commodity and other prices, operational performance, changes in
    environmental, legislative and regulatory requirements and
    regulatory cost recovery. Consumers cannot predict the impact
    that any of these factors may have on the success of its capital
    investment program. It is possible that adverse events reflected
    in these factors could adversely affect Consumers’
    liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.
